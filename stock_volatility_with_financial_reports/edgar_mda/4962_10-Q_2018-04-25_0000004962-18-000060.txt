Basis of Presentation The Company American Express Company is a global services company that provides customers with access to products, insights and experiences that enrich lives and build business success. Our principal products and services are charge and credit payment card products and travel-related services offered to consumers and businesses around the world. Business travel-related services are offered through the non-consolidated joint venture, American Express Global Business Travel (the GBT JV). Our various products and services are sold globally to diverse customer groups, including consumers, small businesses, mid-sized companies and large corporations. These products and services are sold through various channels, including mobile and online applications, direct mail, in-house sales teams, third-party vendors and direct response advertising. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 (the Annual Report). If not materially different, certain footnote disclosures included therein have been omitted from this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The interim consolidated financial information in this report has not been audited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, which consist of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the interim period consolidated financial information, have been made. Results of operations reported for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire year. The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. These accounting estimates reflect the best judgment of management, but actual results could differ. Discount Revenue Discount revenue primarily represents the amount we earn on transactions occurring at merchants that have entered into a card acceptance agreement with us, or a Global Network Services (GNS) partner or other third-party merchant acquirer, for facilitating transactions between the merchants and Card Members. The amount of fees charged, or merchant discount, varies with, among other factors, the industry in which the merchant conducts business, the merchant overall transaction volume, the timing and method of payment to the merchant, the method of submission of transactions and, in certain instances, the geographic scope of the card acceptance agreement signed with us (e.g., local or global) and the transaction amount. The merchant discount is generally deducted from the payment to the merchant and recorded as discount revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs. The card acceptance agreements, which outline the agreed-upon terms for charging the merchant discount fee, vary in duration. Our contracts with small- and medium-sized merchants generally have no fixed contractual duration, while those with large merchants are generally for fixed periods, which typically range from three to seven years in duration. Our fixed-period agreements may include auto-renewal features, which may allow the existing terms to continue beyond the stated expiration date until a new agreement is reached. We satisfy our obligations under these agreements over the contract term, often on a daily basis, through the processing of Card Member transactions and the availability of our payment network. In cases where we are the card issuer and the merchant acquirer is a third party (which is the case, for example, under our OptBlue program, or with certain of our GNS partners), we receive a network rate fee in our settlement with the merchant acquirer, which is individually negotiated between us and that merchant acquirer and is recorded as discount revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs. In our role as the operator of the American Express network, we also settle with merchants on behalf of our GNS card issuing partners, who in turn receive an issuer rate that is individually negotiated between that issuer and us and is recorded as expense in Marketing and business development (see below) or as contra-revenue in Other revenue. In contrast with networks such as those operated by Visa Inc. and Mastercard Incorporated, there are no collectively set interchange rates or network rates on the American Express network, and no fees are agreed or due between the GNS partners on the network. 5 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Net Card Fees Net card fees represent revenue earned from annual card membership fees, which vary based on the type of card and the number of cards for each account. These fees, net of acquisition costs and a reserve for projected refunds for Card Member cancellations, are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the twelve-month card membership period as Net Card Fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The unamortized net card fee balance is reported in Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Other Fees and Commissions Other fees and commissions includes certain fees charged to Card Members, including delinquency fees and foreign currency conversion fees, which are primarily recognized in the period in which they are charged to the Card Member. Other fees and commissions also includes Membership Rewards program fees, which are deferred and recognized over the period covered by the fee, typically one year, the unamortized portion of which is included in Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, Other fees and commissions includes loyalty coalition-related fees, travel commissions and fees and service fees earned from merchants, that are recognized when the service is performed, which is generally in the period the fee is charged. Refer to Note 13 for additional information. Contra-revenue Payments made through contractual arrangements with our merchants, GNS partners, and other customers are classified as expense where we receive goods, services or other benefits, for which the fair value is determinable and measurable. If these conditions are not met, the payment is classified as contra-revenue with the related revenue transaction (e.g., Discount revenue or Other revenue) and recorded when incurred. Interest Income Interest on Card Member loans is assessed using the average daily balance method. Unless the loan is classified as non-accrual, interest is recognized based upon the principal amount outstanding, in accordance with the terms of the applicable account agreement, until the outstanding balance is paid, or written off. Interest and dividends on investment securities primarily relate to our performing fixed-income securities. Interest income is recognized as earned using the effective interest method, which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts, fees and other payments, so that a constant rate of return is recognized on the investment security outstanding balance. Amounts are recognized until securities are in default or when it becomes likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled. Interest on deposits with banks and other is recognized as earned, and primarily relates to the placement of cash, in excess of near-term funding requirements, in interest-bearing time deposits, overnight sweep accounts, and other interest-bearing demand and call accounts. Interest Expense Interest expense includes interest incurred primarily to fund Card Member loans and receivables, general corporate purposes and liquidity needs, and is recognized as incurred. Interest expense is divided principally into two categories: (i) deposits, which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions, and (ii) debt, which primarily relates to interest expense on our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, as well as the realized impact of derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk on our long-term debt. 6 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Marketing and Business Development As further described below under Recently Adopted Accounting Standards, effective January 1, 2018, in conjunction with the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, the previously disclosed Marketing and Promotion line on the Consolidated Statements of Income was changed to Marketing and Business Development to reflect the inclusion of certain reclassified costs from Contra-discount revenue and Other expenses. Marketing and business development provides a more comprehensive view of costs related to building and growing our business, including the reclassified costs. Marketing and business development expense includes costs incurred in the development and initial placement of advertising, which are expensed in the year in which the advertising first takes place. Also included in Marketing and business development expense are Card Member statement credits for qualifying charges on eligible card accounts, corporate incentive payments earned on achievement of preset targets, and certain payments to GNS card issuing partners. These costs are generally expensed as incurred. Card Member Rewards We issue charge and credit cards that allow Card Members to participate in various rewards programs (e.g., Membership Rewards, cobrand and cash back). Rewards expense is recognized in the period Card Members earn rewards, generally by spending on their enrolled card products. We record a Card Member rewards liability that represents the estimated cost of points earned that are expected to be redeemed. Card Member rewards liabilities are impacted over time by enrollment levels, attrition, the volume of points earned and redeemed, and the associated redemption costs. Changes in the Card Member rewards liabilities during the period are taken as a charge or release to the Card Member rewards line. Effective January 1, 2018, in conjunction with the new revenue recognition standard, Card Member rewards also includes cash-back rewards, which were reclassified from contra discount revenue. Classification of various items Certain reclassifications of prior period amounts have been made to conform to the current period presentation, including the reclassification of certain business development expenses from Other expenses to Marketing and business development, that were not directly attributable to the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new accounting guidance on leases. The guidance, effective January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted, requires virtually all leases to be recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We will adopt the standard effective January 1, 2019. The new guidance currently requires a modified retrospective transition approach, which would cause us to record existing operating leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheets upon adoption and in the comparative period. In January 2018, the FASB released an exposure draft that, if issued in its current form, would provide us with the option to adopt the provisions of the new guidance prospectively, without adjusting the comparative periods presented. We are in the process of upgrading our lease administration software and changing business processes and internal controls in preparation for the adoption. Specifically, we are currently reviewing our lease portfolio and are evaluating and interpreting the requirements under the guidance, including the available accounting policy elections, in order to determine the impacts on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows upon adoption. 7 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) In June 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance for recognition of credit losses on financial instruments, effective January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted on January 1, 2019. The guidance introduces a new credit reserving model known as the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) model, which is based on expected losses, and differs significantly from the incurred loss approach used today. The CECL model requires measurement of expected credit losses not only based on historical experience and current conditions, but also by including reasonable and supportable forecasts incorporating forward-looking information. In addition, for available-for-sale debt securities, the new guidance replaces the other-than-temporary impairment model, and requires the recognition of an allowance for reductions in a security fair value attributable to declines in credit quality, instead of a direct write-down of the security when a valuation decline is determined to be other-than-temporary. The guidance also requires a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the reporting period of adoption. We do not intend to adopt the new standard early and are currently evaluating the impact the new guidance will have on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows; however, it is expected that the CECL model will alter the assumptions used in estimating credit losses on Card Member loans and receivables, and may result in material increases to our credit reserves as the new guidance involves earlier recognition of expected losses for the life of the assets. We have established an enterprise-wide, cross-discipline governance structure to implement the new standard, and continue to identify and conclude on key interpretive issues along with evaluating our existing credit loss forecasting models and processes in relation to the new guidance to determine what modifications may be required. In February 2018, as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act), the FASB issued new accounting guidance on the reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) to retained earnings. The optional guidance is effective January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating whether we will adopt the new guidance along with any impacts on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, none of which are expected to be material. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted new revenue recognition guidance issued by the FASB related to contracts with customers. The scope of the new guidance excludes financial instruments such as credit and charge card arrangements. We elected to adopt the standard using the full retrospective method, which we believe is most useful to our investors. Under the full retrospective method, we are applying the standard back to January 1, 2016. As shown below, the most significant impacts of adoption are changes to the classification of certain revenues and expenses, including certain credit and charge card related costs previously netted against discount revenue, such as Card Member cash-back reward costs and statement credits, corporate incentive payments, as well as payments to third-party GNS card issuing partners. Under the new revenue standard, these costs are not considered components of the transaction price of our card acceptance agreements with merchants and thus are not netted against discount revenue, but instead are recognized as expenses. Our payments to third-party GNS card issuing partners are presented net of related revenues earned from the partners. The impact to the 2017 fiscal quarters and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows: Increase (Decrease) Three months ended Year Ended December (Millions) December 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 June 30, 2017 March 31, 2017 2017 2016 Revenues Discount revenue $ 981 $ 930 $ 928 $ 868 $ 3,707 $ 3,699 Other (78 ) (71 ) (64 ) (65 ) (278 ) (253 ) Expenses Marketing and business development 617 591 593 549 2,350 2,420 Card Member rewards $ 286 $ 268 $ 271 $ 254 $ 1,079 $ 1,026 In addition, the cumulative impact to our retained earnings on January 1, 2016 was an increase of $55.2 million. 8 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) The adoption of the new guidance also resulted in changes to the recognition timing of certain revenues, the impact of which is not material to net income. Similarly, the adoption did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Balance Sheets or Statements of Cash Flows. We had no material contract assets, contract liabilities or deferred contract costs recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. Contracts assets and liabilities are reported in a net position on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. In adopting the guidance, we implemented changes to our accounting policies, business processes, systems and internal controls to support the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements under the new standard. Such changes were not material. In January 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on the recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, which was effective and adopted by us as of January 1, 2018. The guidance makes targeted changes to GAAP; specifically to the classification and measurement of equity securities, and to certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial assets and liabilities. This applies to investments we make in non-public companies in the ordinary course of business, which historically were recognized under the cost method of accounting. These investments will be prospectively adjusted through earnings for observable price changes upon the identification of identical or similar transactions of the same company. The adoption of the guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We implemented changes to our accounting policies, business processes and internal controls in support of the new guidance. Such changes were not material. In August 2017, the FASB issued new accounting guidance providing targeted improvements to the accounting for hedging activities, effective January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted in any interim period or fiscal year before the effective date. The guidance introduces a number of amendments, several of which are optional, that are designed to simplify the application of hedge accounting, improve financial statement transparency and more closely align hedge accounting with an entity risk management strategies. Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the guidance, with no material impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, along with associated changes to our accounting policies, business processes and internal controls in support of the new guidance. Such changes were not material. 9 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 2. Business Events During the first quarter of 2018, we acquired from Citibank, N.A. its existing Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. cobrand credit card loan portfolio (the acquired Hilton portfolio). The Hilton portfolio had an outstanding principal and interest balance of approximately $1 billion at acquisition. None of the credit card loans acquired were considered purchased credit impaired at acquisition date. The cash outflows related to this acquisition are reported within the investing section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as a net increase in Card Member receivables and loans. 3.

A Card Member account is considered 90 days past billing if payment has not been received within 90 days of the Card Member billing statement date. In addition, if we initiate collection procedures on an account prior to the account becoming 90 days past billing, the associated Card Member loan and receivable balance is classified as 90 days past billing. These amounts are shown above as 90+ Days Past Due for presentation purposes. See also (b). (b) Delinquency data for periods other than 90 days past billing is not available due to system constraints. Therefore, such data has not been utilized for risk management purposes. The balances that are current to 89 days past due can be derived as the difference between the Total and the 90+ Days Past Due balances. 11 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Credit Quality Indicators for Card Member Loans and Receivables The following tables present the key credit quality indicators as of or for the three months ended March 31: 2018 2017 Net Write-Off Rate Net Write-Off Rate Principal Only (a) Principal, Interest & Fees (a) 30+ Days Past Due as a % of Total Principal Only (a) Principal, Interest & Fees (a) 30+ Days Past Due as a % of Total Card Member Loans: U.S. Consumer Services 2.0 % 2.4 % 1.4 % 1.7 % 2.0 % 1.2 % International Consumer and Network Services 2.1 % 2.6 % 1.6 % 2.0 % 2.5 % 1.7 % Global Small Business Services 1.6 % 1.9 % 1.3 % 1.6 % 1.8 % 1.2 % Card Member Receivables: U.S. Consumer Services 1.3 % 1.5 % 1.3 % 1.5 % 1.7 % 1.3 % International Consumer and Network Services 2.0 % 2.2 % 1.5 % 2.1 % 2.3 % 1.5 % Global Small Business Services 1.7 % 1.9 % 1.8 % 1.8 % 2.0 % 1.6 % 2018 2017 Net Loss Ratio as a % of Charge Volume 90+ Days Past Billing as a % of Receivables Net Loss Ratio as a % of Charge Volume 90+ Days Past Billing as a % of Receivables Card Member Receivables: Global Corporate Payments 0.10 % 0.8 % 0.11 % 0.7 % (a) We present a net write-off rate based on principal losses only (i.e., excluding interest and/or fees) to be consistent with industry convention. In addition, because we consider uncollectible interest and/or fees in estimating its reserves for credit losses, a net write-off rate including principal, interest and/or fees is also presented. Impaired Card Member Loans and Receivables Impaired Card Member loans and receivables are individual larger balance or homogeneous pools of smaller balance loans and receivables for which it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the Card Member agreement. In certain cases, these Card Member loans and receivables are included in one of our various Troubled Debt Restructuring (TDR) modification programs. 12 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) The following tables provide additional information with respect to our impaired Card Member loans and receivables.

Investment Securities Investment securities principally include available-for-sale debt securities carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with unrealized gains and losses recorded in AOCI, net of income taxes. Realized gains and losses are recognized upon disposition of the securities using the specific identification method. Investment securities also include equity securities carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Effective January 1, 2018, unrealized gains and losses are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income; prior to January 1, 2018, unrealized gains and losses were recorded in AOCI, net of income taxes.

The following table summarizes the gross unrealized losses due to temporary impairments by ratio of fair value to amortized cost as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017: Less than 12 months 12 months or more Total Ratio of Fair Value to Gross Gross Gross Amortized Cost Number of Estimated Unrealized Number of Estimated Unrealized Number of Estimated Unrealized (Dollars in millions) Securities Fair Value Losses Securities Fair Value Losses Securities Fair Value Losses 2018: 90% 100% 30 $ 955 $ (18 ) 5 $ 173 $ (7 ) 35 $ 1,128 $ (25 ) Total as of March 31, 2018 30 $ 955 $ (18 ) 5 $ 173 $ (7 ) 35 $ 1,128 $ (25 ) 2017: 90% 100% 34 $ 807 $ (6 ) 13 $ 211 $ (8 ) 47 $ 1,018 $ (14 ) Total as of December 31, 2017 34 $ 807 $ (6 ) 13 $ 211 $ (8 ) 47 $ 1,018 $ (14 ) The gross unrealized losses for available-for-sale debt securities are attributed to wider credit spreads for specific issuers, adverse changes in benchmark interest rates, or a combination thereof, all compared to those prevailing when the investment securities were purchased. Overall, for the available-for-sale debt securities in gross unrealized loss positions, (i) we do not intend to sell the securities, (ii) it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the securities before recovery of the unrealized losses, and (iii) we expect that the contractual principal and interest will be received on the securities. As a result, we recognized no other-than-temporary impairment during the periods presented. Contractual maturities for investment securities with stated maturities as of March 31, 2018 were as follows: Estimated (Millions) Cost Fair Value Due within 1 year $ 465 $ 465 Due after 1 year but within 5 years 1,653 1,639 Due after 5 years but within 10 years 218 214 Due after 10 years 1,017 1,022 Total $ 3,353 $ 3,340 The expected payments on state and municipal obligations and mortgage-backed securities may not coincide with their contractual maturities because the issuers have the right to call or prepay certain obligations. 18 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 6. Asset Securitizations We periodically securitize Card Member loans and receivables arising from our card businesses through the transfer of those assets to securitization trusts, American Express Credit Account Master Trust (the Lending Trust) and American Express Issuance Trust II (the Charge Trust and together with the Lending Trust, the Trusts). The Trusts then issue debt securities collateralized by the transferred assets to third-party investors. We perform the servicing and key decision making for the Trusts, and therefore have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the Trusts economic performance, which are the collection of the underlying Card Member loans and receivables. In addition, we hold all of the variable interests in both Trusts, with the exception of the debt securities issued to third-party investors. As of March 31, 2018, our ownership of variable interests was $9.2 billion for the Lending Trust and $7.1 billion for the Charge Trust. These variable interests held by us provide us with the right to receive benefits and the obligation to absorb losses, which could be significant to both the Lending Trust and the Charge Trust. Based on these considerations, we are the primary beneficiary of both Trusts and therefore consolidate both Trusts. The following table provides information on the restricted cash held by the Lending Trust and the Charge Trust as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets: (Millions) 2018 2017 Lending Trust $ 145 $ 55 Charge Trust 2 7 Total $ 147 $ 62 These amounts relate to collections of Card Member loans and receivables to be used by the Trusts to fund future expenses and obligations, including interest on debt securities, credit losses and upcoming debt maturities. Under the respective terms of the Lending Trust and the Charge Trust agreements, the occurrence of certain triggering events associated with the performance of the assets of each Trust could result in payment of trust expenses, establishment of reserve funds, or, in a worst-case scenario, early amortization of debt securities. During the three months ended March 31, 2018 and the year ended December 31, 2017, no such triggering events occurred. 19 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 7.

Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we and our subsidiaries are subject to various pending and potential legal actions, arbitration proceedings, claims, investigations, examinations, information gathering requests, subpoenas, inquiries and matters relating to compliance with laws and regulations (collectively, legal proceedings). We disclose our material legal proceedings under Part II, Item 1. Legal Proceedings in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings in the Annual Report. In addition to the matters disclosed under Legal Proceedings, we are being challenged in a number of countries regarding our application of value-added taxes (VAT) to certain of our international transactions, which are in various stages of audit, or are being contested in legal actions (collectively, VAT matters). While we believe we have complied with all applicable tax laws, rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions, the tax authorities may determine that we owe additional VAT. In certain jurisdictions where we are contesting the assessments, we were required to pay the VAT assessments prior to contesting. Our legal proceedings range from cases brought by a single plaintiff to class actions with millions of putative class members. These legal proceedings involve various lines of business and a variety of claims (including, but not limited to, common law tort, contract, application of tax laws, antitrust and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel factual allegations and/or unique legal theories. While some matters pending against us specify the damages claimed by the plaintiff or class, many seek an unspecified amount of damages or are at very early stages of the legal process. Even when the amount of damages claimed against us are stated, the claimed amount may be exaggerated and/or unsupported. As a result, some matters have not yet progressed sufficiently through discovery and/or development of important factual information and legal issues to enable us to estimate an amount of loss or a range of possible loss, while other matters have progressed sufficiently such that we are able to estimate an amount of loss or a range of possible loss. We have recorded reserves for certain of our outstanding legal proceedings. A reserve is recorded when it is both (a) probable that a loss has occurred and (b) the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. There may be instances in which an exposure to loss exceeds the recorded reserve. We evaluate, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the reserve that has been previously recorded, or a revision to the disclosed estimated range of possible losses, as applicable. For those disclosed material legal proceedings and VAT matters where a loss is reasonably possible in future periods, whether in excess of a related reserve for legal or tax contingencies or where there is no such reserve, and for which we are able to estimate a range of possible loss, the current estimated range is zero to $420 million in excess of any reserves related to those matters. This range represents management estimate based on currently available information and does not represent our maximum loss exposure; actual results may vary significantly. As such legal proceedings evolve, we may need to increase our range of possible loss or reserves. Based on our current knowledge, and taking into consideration our litigation-related liabilities, we believe we are not a party to, nor are any of our properties the subject of, any legal proceeding that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or liquidity. However, in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters, it is possible that the outcome of legal proceedings, including the possible resolution of merchant claims, could have a material impact on our results of operations. 21 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 9. Derivatives and Hedging Activities We use derivative financial instruments (derivatives) to manage exposures to various market risks. These instruments derive their value from an underlying variable or multiple variables, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity index or price, and are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These instruments enable end users to increase, reduce or alter exposure to various market risks and, for that reason, are an integral component of our market risk management. We do not transact in derivatives for trading purposes. In relation to our credit risk, under the terms of the derivative agreements we have with our various counterparties, we are not required to either immediately settle any outstanding liability balances or post collateral upon the occurrence of a specified credit risk-related event. Based on our assessment of the credit risk of our derivative counterparties as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, no credit risk adjustment to the derivative portfolio was required. The following table summarizes the total fair value, excluding interest accruals, of derivative assets and liabilities as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017: Other Assets Fair Value Other Liabilities Fair Value (Millions) 2018 2017 2018 2017 Derivatives designated as hedging instruments: Fair value hedges - Interest rate contracts (a) $ 3 $ 11 $ 95 $ 34 Net investment hedges - Foreign exchange contracts 71 117 167 89 Total derivatives designated as hedging instruments 74 128 262 123 Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Foreign exchange contracts, including certain embedded derivatives (b) 77 82 117 95 Total derivatives, gross 151 210 379 218 Less: Cash collateral netting (c)(d) (6 ) (94 ) (45 ) Derivative asset and derivative liability netting (e) (85 ) (80 ) (85 ) (80 ) Total derivatives, net $ 66 $ 124 $ 200 $ 93 (a) For centrally cleared derivatives, variation margin payments are legally characterized as settlement payments as opposed to collateral. Accordingly, the amounts disclosed for centrally cleared derivatives are based on gross assets and gross liabilities, net of variation margin. We also maintained several bilateral interest rate contracts that are shown gross of any collateral exchanged. (b) Includes foreign currency derivatives embedded in certain operating agreements. (c) Represents the offsetting of the fair value of bilateral interest rate contracts and certain foreign exchange contracts with the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral. (d) We posted $125 million and $146 million as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, as initial margin on our centrally cleared interest rate swaps; such amounts are recorded within Other receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are not netted against the derivative balances. (e) Represents the amount of netting of derivative assets and derivative liabilities executed with the same counterparty under an enforceable master netting arrangement. A majority of our derivative assets and liabilities as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 are subject to master netting agreements with our derivative counterparties. We have no derivative amounts subject to enforceable master netting arrangements that are not offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Fair Value Hedges We are exposed to interest rate risk associated with our fixed-rate long-term debt obligations. At the time of issuance, certain fixed-rate debt obligations are designated in fair value hedging relationships, using interest rate swaps, to economically convert the fixed interest rate to a floating interest rate. We have $23.4 billion and $23.8 billion of fixed-rate debt obligations designated in fair value hedging relationships as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The following table represents the total amounts of income and expense line items associated with the fair value hedges of our fixed-rate long-term debt on the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three months ended March 31: Gains (losses) (Millions) 2018 2017 Interest expense (a) Other expenses Hedged items $ 210 $ 50 Derivatives designated as hedging instruments (191 ) (75 ) Total $ 19 $ (25 ) (a) We adopted new accounting guidance providing targeted improvements to the accounting for hedging activities effective January 1, 2018. In compliance with the standard, amounts previously recorded in Other expenses have been prospectively recorded in Total interest expense. Refer to Note 1 for additional information. 22 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) The carrying values of the hedged liabilities, recorded within Long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, were $22.9 billion and $23.6 billion as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, including offsetting amounts of $392 million and $182 million for the respective periods, related to the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments. We recognized a net reduction in interest expense on long-term debt of $14 million and $44 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, primarily related to the net settlements (interest accruals) on our interest rate derivatives designated as fair value hedges. Net Investment Hedges The losses on net investment hedges, net of taxes, recorded in AOCI as part of the cumulative translation adjustment, were $162 million and $229 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Accumulated gains within AOCI of $1 million and nil for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were reclassified into Other expenses upon investment sales or liquidations. Derivatives Not Designated as Hedges The changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are intended to offset the related foreign exchange gains or losses of the underlying foreign currency exposures. The changes in the fair value of the derivatives and the related underlying foreign currency exposures resulted in net losses of $21 million and $17 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and are recognized in Other expenses. The changes in the fair value of an embedded derivative resulted in a loss of $2 million and a gain of $1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and are recognized in Card Member services expense. 10.

(d) Presented as a component of customer deposits on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements We have certain assets that are subject to measurement at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. For these assets, measurement at fair value in periods subsequent to their initial recognition is applicable if they are determined to be impaired. During the three months ended March 31, 2018 and the year ended December 31, 2017, we did not have any material assets that were measured at fair value due to impairment. Equity investments previously held at cost that are adjusted through earnings for observable price changes are not material. 24 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 11. Guarantees As of March 31, 2018, the maximum potential undiscounted future payments and related liability resulting from guarantees and indemnifications provided by us in the ordinary course of business were $1 billion and $46 million, respectively, and related primarily to our real estate and business dispositions. As of December 31, 2017, the maximum potential undiscounted future payments and related liability were $1 billion and $52 million, respectively. To date we have not experienced any significant losses related to guarantees or indemnifications. Our recognition of these instruments is at fair value. In addition, we establish reserves when a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. 12. Changes In Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income AOCI is comprised of items that have not been recognized in earnings but may be recognized in earnings in the future when certain events occur.

Other Fees and Commissions, Other Revenues and Other Expenses The following is a detail of Other fees and commissions for the three months ended March 31: (Millions) 2018 2017 Fees charged to Card Members: Delinquency fees $ 242 $ 214 Foreign currency conversion fee revenue 225 199 Other customer fees: Loyalty coalition-related fees 111 102 Travel commissions and fees 99 90 Service fees and other (a) 104 106 Total Other fees and commissions $ 781 $ 711 (a) Other includes Membership Rewards program fees that are not related to contracts with customers. The following is a detail of Other revenues for the three months ended March 31: (Millions) 2018 2017 Global Network Services partner revenues $ 79 $ 94 Other (a) 298 267 Total Other revenues $ 377 $ 361 (a) Other includes revenues arising from net revenue earned on cross-border Card Member spending, insurance premiums earned from Card Member travel and other insurance programs, merchant-related fees, prepaid card and Travelers Cheque-related revenues, revenues related to the GBT JV transition services agreement, earnings from equity method investments (including the GBT JV) and other miscellaneous revenue and fees. Revenue expected to be recognized in future periods related to contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less and contracts with variable consideration (e.g. discount revenue) are not required to be disclosed. Non-interest revenue expected to be recognized in future periods through remaining contracts with customers is not material. The following is a detail of Other expenses for the three months ended March 31: (Millions) 2018 2017 Occupancy and equipment $ 520 $ 474 Professional services 457 501 Other (a) 457 395 Total Other expenses $ 1,434 $ 1,370 (a) For the three months ended March 31, 2018, other expense includes the loss on a transaction involving the operations of our prepaid reloadable and gift card business and gains on the re-measurement of certain equity investments previously carried at cost. For both periods, other expense also includes general operating expenses, Card and merchant-related fraud losses, communication expenses, foreign currency-related gains and losses and insurance costs. 27 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 14. Income Taxes The effective tax rate was 21.5 percent and 32.0 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The change in tax rates primarily reflects the reduction in the U.S. federal statutory tax rate as a result of the Tax Act. The tax rates in both periods also reflect the resolution of certain prior years tax items. In 2017, we recorded an estimated net discrete tax charge of $2.6 billion related to the Tax Act that was accounted for as a provisional charge under SAB 118. There were no material changes to these estimates for the current period. We continue to analyze the impacts of the Tax Act; therefore, the 2017 charge continues to be provisional. We are under continuous examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and tax authorities in other countries and states in which we have significant business operations. The tax years under examination and open for examination vary by jurisdiction. The resolution of such matters did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate. We are currently under examination with the IRS for tax years 2008 through 2014. We believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits could decrease within the next 12 months by as much as $319 million, principally as a result of potential resolutions of prior years tax items with various taxing authorities. The prior years tax items include unrecognized tax benefits relating to the deductibility of certain expenses or losses and the attribution of taxable income to a particular jurisdiction or jurisdictions. Of the $319 million of unrecognized tax benefits, approximately $291 million relates to amounts that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate in a future period. 15. Earnings Per Common Share (EPS) The computations of basic and diluted EPS for the three months ended March 31 were as follows: (Millions, except per share amounts) 2018 2017 Numerator: Basic and diluted: Net income $ 1,634 $ 1,251 Preferred dividends (21 ) (21 ) Net income available to common shareholders $ 1,613 $ 1,230 Earnings allocated to participating share awards (a) (13 ) (10 ) Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 1,600 $ 1,220 Denominator: (a) Basic: Weighted-average common stock 859 899 Add: Weighted-average stock options (b) 2 4 Diluted 861 903 Basic EPS $ 1.86 $ 1.36 Diluted EPS $ 1.86 $ 1.35 (a) Our unvested restricted stock awards, which include the right to receive non-forfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents, are considered participating securities. Calculations of EPS under the two-class method exclude from the numerator any dividends paid or owed on participating securities and any undistributed earnings considered to be attributable to participating securities. The related participating securities are similarly excluded from the denominator. (b) The dilutive effect of unexercised stock options excludes from the computation of EPS 0.6 million and 1.2 million of options for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, because inclusion of the options would have been anti-dilutive. 28 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 16. Reportable Operating Segments We are a global services company that is principally engaged in businesses comprising four reportable operating segments: USCS, ICNS, GCS and Global Merchant Services (GMS). Corporate functions and certain other businesses and operations are included in Corporate & Other. Effective January 1, 2018, we changed the methodology used to allocate certain corporate overhead costs and interest income and expense to the operating segments. Prior period amounts have been revised to conform to the current period presentation.

Subsequent Event Effective April 1, 2018, American Express Centurion Bank and American Express Bank, FSB were merged to become American Express National Bank, regulated, supervised and examined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The merger did not have any impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Business Introduction When we use the terms American Express, we, our or us, we mean American Express Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, unless we state or the context implies otherwise. We are a global services company with four operating segments used for financial reporting in the first quarter: U.S. Consumer Services (USCS), International Consumer and Network Services (ICNS), Global Commercial Services (GCS) and Global Merchant Services (GMS). Corporate functions and certain other businesses and operations are included in Corporate & Other. During the first quarter of 2018, we announced organizational changes that combined our U.S. and International consumer businesses into a global consumer services organization, and combined our merchant and network-related businesses, among other changes. Our financial disclosures will reflect these organizational changes starting in the second quarter of 2018, which is consistent with when our executives will begin to review financial information aligned to the new segments. Our reportable operating segments will be as follows: Global Consumer Services Group, including our U.S. and International Consumer Card Services businesses; Global Merchant and Network Services, including our Global Merchant Services business, the Global Network Services business, and our Loyalty Coalition programs; and Global Commercial Services, including our Global Corporate Payments business and our small business services. We provide our customers with access to products, insights and experiences that enrich lives and build business success. Our principal products and services are charge and credit payment card products and travel-related services offered to consumers and businesses around the world. Our range of products and services includes: Charge card, credit card and other payment and financing products Merchant acquisition and processing, servicing and settlement, and point-of-sale marketing and information products and services for merchants Network services Other fee services, including fraud prevention services and the design and operation of customer loyalty programs Expense management products and services Travel-related services Stored-value/prepaid products Our various products and services are sold globally to diverse customer groups, including consumers, small businesses, mid-sized companies and large corporations. These products and services are sold through various channels, including mobile and online applications, direct mail, in-house sales teams, third-party vendors and direct response advertising. Business travel-related services are offered through our non-consolidated joint venture, American Express Global Business Travel (the GBT JV). We compete in the global payments industry with charge, credit and debit card networks, issuers and acquirers, paper-based transactions (e.g., cash and checks), bank transfer models (e.g., wire transfers and ACH), as well as evolving and growing alternative payment and financing providers. As the payments industry continues to evolve, we face increasing competition from non-traditional players that leverage new technologies and customer relationships to create payment or financing solutions. 30 Table of Contents The following types of revenue are generated from our various products and services: Discount revenue, our largest revenue source, represents fees generally charged to merchants for accepting our cards as payment for goods or services sold; Interest on loans, principally represents interest income earned on outstanding balances; Net card fees, represent revenue earned from annual card membership fees, which varies based on the type of card and the number of cards for each account; Other fees and commissions, represent Card Member delinquency fees, foreign currency conversion fees charged to Card Members, loyalty coalition-related fees, travel commissions and fees, service fees and fees related to our Membership Rewards program; and Other revenue, primarily represents revenues arising from contracts with partners of our Global Network Services (GNS) business (including commissions and signing fees less issuer rate payments), cross-border Card Member spending, insurance premiums earned from Card Members, ancillary merchant-related fees, revenues related to the GBT JV transition services agreement, prepaid card and Travelers Cheque-related revenue and earnings from equity method investments (including the GBT JV). Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted new revenue recognition guidance using the full retrospective method, which applies the new standard to each prior reporting period presented, starting January 1, 2016. The adoption changed the recognition timing and classification of certain revenues and expenses, including changes to the presentation of certain credit and charge card related costs that were previously netted against discount revenue. The adoption did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, net income, equity or cash flows. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In addition, we reclassified certain business development expenses, from other expenses to marketing and business development, which was not directly attributable to the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance. Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures Certain of the statements in this Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Refer to the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements section. We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). However, certain information included within this Form 10-Q constitutes non-GAAP financial measures. Our calculations of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the calculations of similarly titled measures by other companies. Bank Holding Company American Express is a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve) is our primary federal regulator. As such, we are subject to the Federal Reserve regulations, policies and minimum capital standards. Business Environment Our results for the first quarter reflect a solid start to the year as we continue to invest across our four key focus areas strengthening our leadership position with premium consumers, extending our strong position in the commercial payments space, making American Express an essential part of our customers digital lives and strengthening our global, integrated network. The increase in earnings per share versus the prior year reflected growth across our businesses as well as a lower tax provision due to the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act). Our worldwide billed business increased 12 percent over the prior year, reflecting growth across all of our customer segments and geographies. Our U.S. and international proprietary consumer card issuing businesses saw a sequential improvement in billings growth. U.S. billings growth benefited from the acquisition from Citibank, N.A. of the portion of the Hilton cobrand portfolio that we did not previously own (the acquired Hilton portfolio), growth from existing customers and strong growth in our Platinum portfolios, which was driven by prior year investments. Commercial billings growth also accelerated driven by growth from large and global commercial customers, as well as middle market and small business customers. As anticipated, Global Network Services billed business grew at a slower rate than our proprietary business due to the impact of the evolving regulatory environment in Europe and Australia. 31 Table of Contents Revenues net of interest expense grew, reflecting higher Card Member spending, loans and fee income, partially offset by a decline in the average discount rate. We are focused on driving discount revenue growth, not on maximizing the average discount rate, which has led us to selectively adjust such rate in order to drive higher volume growth and overall economics. Our net interest yield increased year-over-year, primarily related to a shift in mix over time towards non-cobrand lending products that generally attract more revolving loan balances, a lower percentage of total loans at introductory interest rates and specific pricing actions. We continue to expect net interest yield to stabilize sequentially. Card Member loans grew year-over-year as we continued to expand our lending relationships with existing customers and acquired new Card Members, including the previously mentioned acquired Hilton portfolio. Provisions for losses increased as a result of higher Card Member loans and receivables and increases in lending delinquencies and net write-off rates. The increases in the delinquencies and net write-off rates were in line with our expectations and primarily due to the seasoning of recent loan vintages and a shift in mix over time towards non-cobrand lending products, which have higher write-off rates but also drive higher net interest yields. We expect these trends relating to lending write-off rates, delinquencies and provisions for losses to continue. Spending on customer engagement (the aggregate of rewards, Card Member services and marketing and business development expenses) increased year-over-year, driven in part by growth in rewards, which reflects the growth in billings, and continued higher levels of usage across many of our premium travel services. Marketing and business development expense increased due to partner payments related to our recent cobrand agreements and higher corporate client incentives. We expect marketing and business development expenses to be higher over the balance of the year due to increased investments. Operating expense increased year-over-year, reflecting the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and a number of discrete items, including a loss on a transaction related to our prepaid business operations and gains on the re-measurement of certain equity investments previously held at cost. As previously announced, we have suspended our share buyback program for the first half of 2018 in order to rebuild our capital, and as a result, we saw our capital ratios improve during the first quarter. We continued to return capital to shareholders through our dividend distributions. While we continue to see some headwinds from a rising interest rate environment, regulation in countries around the world and intense competition, we remain focused on delivering differentiated value to our merchants, customers and business partners, while delivering appropriate returns to our shareholders. See Certain legislative, regulatory and other developments in Other Matters for information on certain matters that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 32 Table of Contents American Express Company Consolidated Results of Operations Refer to the Glossary of Selected Terminology for the definitions of certain key terms and related information appearing within this section. The discussions in both the Consolidated Results of Operations and Business Segment Results provide commentary on the variances for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to same period in the prior year, as presented in the accompanying tables. Effective January 1, 2018, we changed the methodology used to allocate certain corporate overhead costs and interest income and expense to the operating segments. Prior period amounts have been revised to conform to the current period presentation. Table 1: Summary of Financial Performance Three Months Ended March 31, Change (Millions, except percentages and per share amounts) 2018 2017 2018 vs. 2017 Total revenues net of interest expense $ 9,718 $ 8,709 $ 1,009 12 % Provisions for losses 775 573 202 35 Expenses 6,861 6,297 564 9 Pretax income 2,082 1,839 243 13 Income tax provision 448 588 (140 ) (24 ) Net income 1,634 1,251 383 31 Earnings per common share diluted (a) $ 1.86 $ 1.35 $ 0.51 38 % Return on average equity (b) 15.2 % 24.9 % Effective tax rate 21.5 % 32.0 % (a) Earnings per common share diluted was reduced by the impact of (i) earnings allocated to participating share awards and other items of $13 million and $10 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and (ii) dividends on preferred shares of $21 million for both the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. (b) Return on average equity (ROE) is computed by dividing (i) one-year period net income ($3.1 billion and $5.2 billion for March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively) by (ii) one-year average total shareholders equity ($20.5 billion and $20.8 billion for March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively). Table 2: Total Revenue Net of Interest Expense Summary Three Months Ended March 31, Change (Millions, except percentages) 2018 2017 2018 vs. 2017 Discount revenue $ 5,889 $ 5,387 $ 502 9 % Net card fees 830 748 82 11 Other fees and commissions 781 711 70 10 Other 377 361 16 4 Total non-interest revenues 7,877 7,207 670 9 Total interest income 2,462 1,945 517 27 Total interest expense 621 443 178 40 Net interest income 1,841 1,502 339 23 Total revenues net of interest expense $ 9,718 $ 8,709 $ 1,009 12 % Total Revenues Net of Interest Expense Discount revenue increased, primarily due to growth in billed business, partially offset by a decrease in the average discount rate. Worldwide billed business increased by 12 percent, driven by 10 percent and 17 percent increases in U.S. and non-U.S. billed business, respectively. See Tables 5 and 6 for more details on the average discount rate and billed business performance. The decrease in the average discount rate primarily reflected rate reductions from merchant negotiations, including those resulting from the recent regulatory changes affecting competitor pricing in certain international markets, the continued growth of the OptBlue program, and changes in industry and geographic mix. We expect the average discount rate will continue to decline over time due to a greater shift of existing merchants into OptBlue, merchant negotiations and competition, volume related pricing discounts, certain pricing initiatives mainly driven by pricing regulation (including regulation of competitors interchange rates) and other factors. 33 Table of Contents Net card fees increased, primarily driven by growth in certain key international countries as well as growth in the Platinum and Delta portfolios. Other fees and commissions increased, primarily driven by increases in delinquency fees, due to a change in the late fee assessment date for certain U.S. charge cards, foreign exchange conversion revenue and loyalty coalition-related fees. Other revenues increased, primarily driven by an increase in the profit distribution from the GBT JV. Interest income increased, primarily reflecting higher average Card Member loans and higher yields. The growth in average Card Member loans was primarily driven by expanding relationships with existing customers, as well as the inclusion of the acquired Hilton portfolio. The increase in yields was primarily driven by a greater percentage of loans at higher rate buckets, specific pricing actions, and a mix shift over time towards non-cobrand lending products, where Card Members tend to revolve more of their loan balances. Interest expense increased, primarily driven by higher interest rates and higher average deposits and long-term debt, partially offset by fair value hedge ineffectiveness previously reported in Other expense.

The prior period has been conformed to the current period presentation. 34 Table of Contents Expenses Marketing and business development expenses increased, primarily due to higher cobrand partner payments as a result of recent cobrand agreements, and increased corporate client incentives driven by higher volumes, partially offset by lower spending on growth initiatives. Card Member rewards expenses increased, primarily due to increases in Membership Rewards expense of $141 million and cobrand rewards expense of $127 million, both of which were primarily driven by higher spending volumes. The Membership Rewards Ultimate Redemption Rate (URR) for current program participants was 95 percent (rounded down) at both March 31, 2018 and 2017. Card Member services expenses increased, primarily driven by higher usage of travel-related benefits and the enhanced Platinum card benefits. Salaries and employee benefits expenses increased, primarily driven by increases in payroll costs and incentive compensation. Other expenses increased, primarily driven by a loss on a transaction involving the operations of our prepaid reloadable and gift card business, partially offset by gains on the re-measurement of certain equity investments previously carried at cost. Income Taxes The effective tax rate decreased, primarily reflecting the reduction in the U.S. federal statutory tax rate as a result of the Tax Act. 35 Table of Contents Table 5: Selected Card-Related Statistical Information As of or for the Change Three Months Ended 2018 March 31, vs. 2018 2017 2017 Card billed business: (billions) United States $ 182.5 $ 165.4 10 % Outside the United States 101.3 86.9 17 Worldwide $ 283.8 $ 252.3 12 Proprietary $ 236.9 $ 208.9 13 Global Network Services 46.9 43.4 8 Worldwide $ 283.8 $ 252.3 12 Total cards-in-force: (millions) United States 51.3 48.2 6 Outside the United States 62.9 63.0 Worldwide 114.2 111.2 3 Proprietary 66.4 62.2 7 Global Network Services 47.8 49.0 (2 ) Worldwide 114.2 111.2 3 Basic cards-in-force: (millions) United States 40.4 38.1 6 Outside the United States 52.4 52.2 Worldwide 92.8 90.3 3 Average basic Card Member spending: (dollars) (a) United States $ 5,015 $ 4,859 3 Outside the United States 3,869 3,283 18 Worldwide Average $ 4,677 $ 4,387 7 Card Member loans: (billions) United States $ 63.9 $ 56.6 13 Outside the United States 8.9 7.0 27 Worldwide $ 72.8 $ 63.6 14 Average discount rate (b) 2.37 % 2.43 % Average fee per card (dollars) (a) $ 51 $ 48 6 % (a) Average basic Card Member spending and average fee per card are computed from proprietary card activities only.

(c) Adjusted net interest income and net interest yield on average Card Member loans are non-GAAP measures. Refer to Glossary of Selected Terminology for the definitions of these terms. We believe adjusted net interest income is useful to investors because it represents the interest expense and interest income attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio and is a component of net interest yield on average Card Member loans, which provides a measure of profitability of our Card Member loan portfolio. Net interest yield on average Card Member loans reflects adjusted net interest income divided by average Card Member loans, computed on an annualized basis. Net interest income divided by average Card Member loans, computed on an annualized basis, a GAAP measure, includes elements of total interest income and total interest expense that are not attributable to the Card Member loan portfolio, and thus is not representative of net interest yield on average Card Member loans. 39 Table of Contents Business Segment Results U.S. Consumer Services Table 9: USCS Selected Income Statement Data Three Months Ended March 31, Change (Millions, except percentages) 2018 2017 2018 vs. 2017 Revenues Non-interest revenues $ 2,294 $ 2,118 $ 176 8 % Interest income 1,656 1,310 346 26 Interest expense 253 161 92 57 Net interest income 1,403 1,149 254 22 Total revenues net of interest expense 3,697 3,267 430 13 Provisions for losses 423 294 129 44 Total revenues net of interest expense after provisions for losses 3,274 2,973 301 10 Expenses Marketing, business development, rewards, Card Member services 1,771 1,564 207 13 Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses 690 671 19 3 Total expenses 2,461 2,235 226 10 Pretax segment income 813 738 75 10 Income tax provision 173 244 (71 ) (29 ) Segment income $ 640 $ 494 $ 146 30 % Effective tax rate 21.3 % 33.1 % USCS issues a wide range of proprietary consumer cards and provides services to consumers in the United States, including travel services. Non-interest revenues increased, primarily driven by discount revenue, which increased $142 million, or 9 percent, reflecting an increase in billed business of 11 percent. Net card fees and other fees and commissions increased, driven primarily by growth in the Platinum and Delta portfolios and higher delinquency fees, respectively. Net interest income increased, primarily driven by growth in average Card Member loans and higher yields, partially offset by higher interest expense, primarily driven by higher cost of funds. The growth in average Card Member loans was primarily driven by expanding relationships with existing customers, as well as the inclusion of the acquired Hilton portfolio. The increase in yields was primarily driven by a greater percentage of loans at higher rate buckets, specific pricing actions, and a mix shift over time towards non-cobrand lending products, where Card Members tend to revolve more of their loan balances. Provision for losses increased, driven by Card Member loan provision, which increased by $136 million primarily due to strong lending growth and higher delinquencies and write-offs due to continued seasoning of recent loan vintages and a shift in mix over time towards non-cobrand products. Marketing, business development, rewards, Card Member services expenses increased across all expense categories. Card Member rewards expense increased $132 million, driven by increased spending volumes across both proprietary and cobrand portfolios. Card Member services expenses increased, driven by higher usage of travel-related benefits and enhanced Platinum card benefits. Marketing and business development expenses increased, driven by higher cobrand partner payments, partially offset by lower spending on growth initiatives. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses increased, primarily driven by higher technology and other servicing-related costs, partially offset by gains on the re-measurement, in the current period, of certain equity investments previously carried at cost and prior period hedge ineffectiveness now included in Interest expense.

Non-interest revenues increased, primarily driven by discount revenue, which increased $98 million, due to an increase in proprietary billed business and the impact of changes in the foreign exchange rates. Net card fees and other fees and commissions increased, primarily driven by growth in cards-in-force and higher delinquency fees, respectively. Total billed business increased, reflecting higher proprietary cards-in-force and average spend per card. Refer to Tables 6, 7 and 12 for additional information on billed business. Net interest income increased for the three month period, primarily driven by higher average loan balances, partially offset by higher cost of funds. Provisions for losses increased due to strong growth in both Card Member receivables and loans resulting in higher delinquencies and write-offs. Marketing, business development, rewards, Card Member services expenses increased, primarily driven by Card Member rewards expense, which increased $83 million, due to higher spending volumes, and marketing and business development expense primarily due to increased investment levels in our proprietary business.

Table 18: Regulatory Risk-Based Capital Components and Risk Weighted Assets American Express Company March 31, ($ in Billions) 2018 Risk-Based Capital (a) Common Equity Tier 1 $ 13.9 Tier 1 Capital 15.5 Tier 2 Capital (b) 2.4 Total Capital 17.9 Risk-Weighted Assets 147.4 Average Total Assets to calculate the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio 175.0 Total Leverage Exposure to calculate supplementary leverage ratio $ 204.4 (a) Regulatory capital adjustments and deductions have been fully transitioned effective January 1, 2018. (b) Tier 2 capital is the sum of the allowance for loan and receivable losses (limited to 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets) and $600 million of subordinated notes adjusted for capital held by insurance subsidiaries. 48 Table of Contents We seek to maintain capital levels and ratios in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements and finance such capital in a cost efficient manner; failure to maintain minimum capital levels could affect our status as a financial holding company and cause the regulatory agencies with oversight of American Express and American Express National Bank to take actions that could limit our business operations. Our primary source of equity capital has been the generation of net income. Capital generated through net income and other sources, such as the exercise of stock options by employees, is used to maintain a strong balance sheet, support asset growth and engage in acquisitions, with excess available for distribution to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We currently expect that the portion of generated capital we allocate to support asset growth will be greater going forward than it has been historically due to projected asset growth. We maintain certain flexibility to shift capital across our businesses as appropriate. For example, we may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements. These infused amounts can affect the capital profile and liquidity levels at the American Express parent company level. The following are definitions for our regulatory risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratio, which are calculated as per standard regulatory guidance: Risk-Weighted Assets Assets are weighted for risk according to a formula used by the Federal Reserve to conform to capital adequacy guidelines. On- and off-balance sheet items are weighted for risk, with off-balance sheet items converted to balance sheet equivalents, using risk conversion factors, before being allocated a risk-adjusted weight. Off-balance sheet exposures comprise a minimal part of the total risk-weighted assets. Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio Calculated as Common Equity Tier 1 capital (CET1), divided by risk-weighted assets. CET1 is the sum of common shareholders equity, adjusted for ineligible goodwill and intangible assets, certain deferred tax assets, as well as certain other comprehensive income items as follows: net unrealized gains/losses on securities and derivatives, and net unrealized pension and other postretirement benefit/losses, all net of tax. Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio Calculated as Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 capital is the sum of CET1, our perpetual preferred stock and third-party non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries adjusted for capital held by insurance subsidiaries and deferred tax assets from net operating losses not deducted from CET1. The minimum requirement for the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is 1.5 percent higher than the minimum for the CET1 risk-based capital ratio. We have $1.6 billion of preferred shares outstanding to help address a portion of the Tier 1 capital requirements in excess of common equity requirements. Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio Calculated as the sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 2 capital is the sum of the allowance for loan and receivable losses (limited to 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets), a portion of the unrealized gains on equity securities and $600 million of subordinated notes, adjusted for capital held by insurance subsidiaries. Tier 1 Leverage Ratio Calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by our average total consolidated assets for the most recent quarter. Supplementary Leverage Ratio Calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by total leverage exposure under Basel III. Leverage exposure, which reflects average total consolidated assets with adjustments for Tier 1 capital deductions, average off-balance sheet derivatives exposures, securities purchased under agreements to resell and credit equivalents of undrawn commitments that are both conditionally and unconditionally cancellable. Share Repurchases and Dividends We return capital to common shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The share repurchases reduce common shares outstanding and more than offset the issuance of new shares as part of employee compensation plans. We decided to suspend our share buyback program for the first half of 2018 in order to rebuild our capital levels and ratios. We intend to continue our quarterly dividends during the first half of 2018 at the current level. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, we returned $0.3 billion to our shareholders in the form of common stock dividends. These dividends represent approximately 19 percent of total capital generated during the quarter. 49 Table of Contents Authorization for share repurchases and dividends beginning in the second half of 2018 was submitted as part of our capital plan within the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) 2018 process as discussed below. In addition, during the three months ended March 31, 2018, we had $750 million of non-cumulative perpetual preferred shares (the Series B Preferred Shares) and $850 million of non-cumulative perpetual preferred shares (the Series C Preferred Shares) outstanding. Dividends declared and paid on Series C Preferred Shares during the first quarter of 2018 were $21 million. Bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets, including us, are required to develop and maintain a capital plan, and to submit the capital plan to the Federal Reserve for review under its CCAR process. All such bank holding companies were required to submit their capital plans and stress testing results to the Federal Reserve by April 5, 2018. The Federal Reserve is expected to publish the decisions for all the bank holding companies participating in CCAR 2018, including the reasons for any objection to capital plans, by June 30, 2018. In addition, the Federal Reserve will separately publish the results of its supervisory stress test under both the supervisory severely adverse and adverse scenarios. The information to be released will include, among other things, the Federal Reserve projection of company-specific information, including post-stress capital ratios and the minimum value of these ratios over the planning horizon. Funding Strategy Our principal funding objective is to maintain broad and well-diversified funding sources to allow us to meet our maturing obligations, cost-effectively finance current and future asset growth in our global businesses as well as to maintain a strong liquidity profile. We meet our funding needs through a variety of sources, including direct and third-party distributed deposits and debt instruments, such as senior unsecured debentures, asset securitizations, borrowings through secured borrowing facilities and a long-term committed bank borrowing facility. While we diversify our funding sources by maintaining scale and relevance in unsecured debentures, asset securitizations and deposits, we currently expect that the Personal Savings High Yield Savings Account direct retail deposit program will become a larger proportion over time. Summary of Consolidated Debt We had the following consolidated debt and customer deposits outstanding as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017: Table 19: Summary of Consolidated Debt and Customer Deposits (Billions) March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Short-term borrowings $ 1.8 $ 3.3 Long-term debt 52.5 55.8 Total debt 54.3 59.1 Customer deposits 66.7 64.5 Total debt and customer deposits $ 121.0 $ 123.6 During the three months ended March 31, 2018, we issued (i) $2.0 billion of asset-backed securities from the American Express Credit Account Master Trust (the Lending Trust) consisting of $1.0 billion of two year Class A Certificates at a fixed rate of 2.67 percent, $500 million of five year Class A Certificates at a fixed rate of 3.01 percent and $500 million of five year Class A Certificates at a floating rate of 1-month LIBOR plus 32 basis points, and (ii) $2.0 billion of senior unsecured notes from American Express Company consisting of $1.6 billion of five year notes at a fixed rate of 3.40 percent and $400 million of five year notes at a floating rate of 3-month LIBOR plus 65 basis points. Our equity capital and funding strategies are designed, among other things, to maintain appropriate and stable unsecured debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies: Moody Investor Services (Moody s), Standard & Poor (S&P), Fitch Ratings (Fitch) and Dominion Bond Rating Services (DBRS). Such ratings help support our access to cost-effective unsecured funding as part of our overall funding strategy. Our asset securitization activities are rated separately. 50 Table of Contents Table 20: Unsecured Debt Ratings Credit Agency American Express Entity Short-Term Ratings Long-Term Ratings Outlook DBRS All rated entities R-1 (middle) A (high) Stable Fitch All rated entities F1 A Stable Moody TRS and rated operating subsidiaries (a) Prime 1 A2 Stable Moody's American Express Company Prime 2 A3 Stable S&P TRS (a) N/A A- Stable S&P Other rated operating subsidiaries A-2 A- Stable S&P American Express Company A-2 BBB+ Stable (a) American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. Downgrades in the ratings of our unsecured debt or asset securitization program securities could result in higher funding costs, as well as higher fees related to borrowings under our unused lines of credit. Declines in credit ratings could also reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets. We believe our funding mix, including the proportion of U.S. retail deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on our funding capacity and costs. Liquidity Management We incur liquidity risk that arises in the course of offering our products and services. Our liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of on- and off-balance sheet liquidity sources. We seek to maintain liquidity sources, even in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions, in amounts sufficient to meet our expected future financial obligations and business requirements for liquidity for a period of at least twelve months. Our liquidity risk policy sets out our objectives and approach to managing liquidity risk. The liquidity risks that we are exposed to could arise from a wide variety of scenarios. Our liquidity management strategy thus includes a number of elements, including, but not limited to: Maintaining diversified funding sources (refer to the Funding Strategy section for more details); Maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and off-balance sheet liquidity sources; Projecting cash inflows and outflows under a variety of economic and market scenarios; Establishing clear objectives for liquidity risk management, including compliance with regulatory requirements; and Incorporating liquidity risk management as appropriate into our capital adequacy framework. The amount and type of liquidity resources we maintain can vary over time, based upon the results of stress scenarios required under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and other various regulatory liquidity requirements, such as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), as well as additional stress scenarios required under our liquidity risk policy. The investment income we receive on liquidity resources, such as cash, is less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances. The net interest costs to maintain these resources have been substantial. The level of future net interest costs depends on the amount of liquidity resources we maintain and the difference between our cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields. Securitized Borrowing Capacity As of March 31, 2018, we maintained our committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility, with a maturity date of July 15, 2020, which gives us the right to sell up to $3.0 billion face amount of eligible AAA notes from the American Express Issuance Trust II (the Charge Trust). We also maintained our committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility, with a maturity date of September 15, 2020, which gives us the right to sell up to $2.0 billion face amount of eligible AAA certificates from the Lending Trust. Both facilities are used in the ordinary course of business to fund seasonal working capital needs, as well as to further enhance our contingent funding resources. As of March 31, 2018, no amounts were drawn on the Charge Trust or Lending Trust facilities. 51 Table of Contents Federal Reserve Discount Window As an insured depository institution, American Express National Bank may borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, subject to the amount of qualifying collateral that they may pledge. The Federal Reserve has indicated that both credit and charge card receivables are a form of qualifying collateral for secured borrowings made through the discount window. Whether specific assets will be considered qualifying collateral and the amount that may be borrowed against the collateral, remain at the discretion of the Federal Reserve. We had approximately $70.1 billion as of March 31, 2018 in U.S. credit card loans and charge card receivables that could be sold over time through our securitization trusts or pledged in return for secured borrowings to provide further liquidity, subject in each case to applicable market conditions and eligibility criteria. Committed Bank Credit Facility In addition to the secured borrowing facilities described earlier in this section, we maintained a committed syndicated bank credit facility as of March 31, 2018 of $3.5 billion, which expires on October 16, 2020. As of March 31, 2018, no amounts were drawn on this facility. Unused Credit Outstanding As of March 31, 2018, we had approximately $289 billion of unused credit outstanding as part of established lending product agreements. Total unused credit does not represent potential future cash requirements, as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn. Our charge card products generally have no pre-set limit, and therefore are not reflected in unused credit available to Card Members. Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the three months ended March 31: Table 21: Cash Flows (Billions) 2018 2017 Total cash (used in) provided by: Operating activities $ 2.0 $ 1.2 Investing activities (0.7 ) 0.7 Financing activities (2.9 ) 2.2 Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents (0.2 ) 0.1 Net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ (1.8 ) $ 4.2 Cash Flows from Operating Activities Our cash flows from operating activities primarily include net income adjusted for (i) non-cash items included in net income and (ii) changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities, which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of payments. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in the current period was driven by net income adjusted for non-cash items, including changes in provisions for losses, depreciation and amortization, deferred taxes and stock-based compensation, and changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily accounts payable and other liabilities as a result of normal business operations. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Our cash flows from investing activities primarily include changes in Card Member loans and receivables, as well as changes in our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. The increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by a net increase in the investment securities portfolio. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Our cash flows from financing activities primarily include changes in long-term debt, short-term borrowings and customer deposits as well as our regular common share dividend and share repurchase program. The increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by a net decrease in long-term debt and short-term borrowings, partially offset by an increase in customer deposits. 52 Table of Contents OTHER MATTERS Certain Legislative, Regulatory and Other Developments We are subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world, and the costs of compliance are substantial. In recent years, the financial services industry has been subject to rigorous scrutiny, high regulatory expectations, and a stringent and unpredictable regulatory enforcement environment. Please see the Supervision and Regulation and Risk Factors sections of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 (the 2017 Form 10-K) for further information. Payments Regulation Legislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the operation of card networks, including through antitrust actions, legislation and regulations to change certain practices or pricing of card issuers, merchant acquirers and payment networks, and, in some cases, to establish broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes for payment systems. The European Union, Australia and other jurisdictions have focused on the fees merchants pay to accept cards, including the way bankcard network members collectively set the interchange (that is, the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in four party networks like Visa and MasterCard), as well as the rules, contract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance. Even where we are not directly regulated, regulation of bankcard fees can significantly negatively impact the discount revenue derived from our business, including as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees. In some cases, such regulation extends to certain aspects of our business. For more information on the European Union and Australian payments regulation, as well as the potential impacts on our results of operations and business, please see the Supervision and Regulation and Risk Factors sections of the 2017 Form 10-K. Broad regulatory oversight over payment systems can also include, in some cases, requirements for international card networks to localize aspects of their operations, such as processing infrastructure, which could increase our costs and diminish the value of our closed loop. The development and enforcement of payment system regulatory regimes generally continue to grow and may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and maintain and extend our global network. Surcharging In certain countries, such as certain Member States in the European Union and Australia, merchants are permitted by law to surcharge card purchases. While surcharging continues to be actively considered in certain jurisdictions, the benefits to customers have not been apparent in countries that have allowed it, and in some cases regulators are addressing concerns about excessive surcharging by merchants. For example, the Reserve Bank of Australia amended its rules to limit surcharging in Australia to the actual cost of card acceptance paid to the merchant acquirer. Surcharging, particularly where it disproportionately impacts American Express Card Members, which is known as differential surcharging, as well as other steering practices that are permitted by regulation in some countries, could have a material adverse effect on us if it becomes widespread. As revisions to the Payment Services Directive in the European Union are transposed into national law by each Member State, there may be increased instances of differential surcharging of our cards, customer and merchant confusion as to which transactions may be surcharged and Card Member dissatisfaction. In addition, the laws of a number of states in the United States that prohibit surcharging are being challenged in litigation brought by merchant groups. For more information on the potential impacts of surcharging and other actions that could impair the Card Member experience, please see the Risk Factors section of the 2017 Form 10-K. 53 Table of Contents Consumer Financial Products Regulation In the United States, our marketing, sale and servicing of consumer financial products and our compliance with certain federal consumer financial laws are supervised and examined by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which has broad rulemaking and enforcement authority over providers of credit, savings and payment services and products and authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices. In addition, a number of U.S. states have significant consumer credit protection, disclosure and other laws (in certain cases more stringent than U.S. federal laws). U.S. federal law also regulates abusive debt collection practices, which along with bankruptcy and debtor relief laws, can affect our ability to collect amounts owed to us or subject us to regulatory scrutiny. Internal and regulatory reviews to assess compliance with such laws and regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, changes to our practices, products and procedures, substantial restitution to our Card Members and increased costs related to regulatory oversight, supervision and examination. Such reviews may also result in additional regulatory actions, including civil money penalties. These types of reviews will be a continuing focus for the CFPB and regulators more broadly, as well as for the Company itself. For more information on consumer financial products regulation, as well as the potential impacts on our results of operations and business, please see the Supervision and Regulation and Risk Factors sections of the 2017 Form 10-K. Antitrust Litigation The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and certain states attorneys general brought an action against us in 2010 alleging that the provisions in our card acceptance agreements with merchants that prohibit merchants from engaging in various actions to discriminate against our card products violate the U.S. antitrust laws. We continue to vigorously defend this and similar antitrust claims initiated by merchants in other court and arbitration proceedings. See Part II, Item 1. Legal Proceedings below and the Legal Proceedings section in our 2017 Form 10-K for descriptions of the DOJ and related cases. It is possible that significantly increased merchant steering or other actions impairing the Card Member experience, or the resolution of one or any combination of these merchant claims for damages, could have a material adverse effect on our business. For more information on the potential impacts of an adverse decision in the merchant litigations on our business, please see the Risk Factors section of the 2017 Form 10-K. Privacy, Data Protection, Information and Cyber Security Regulatory and legislative activity in the areas of privacy, data protection and information and cyber security continues to increase worldwide. We have established and continue to maintain policies that provide a framework for compliance with applicable laws, meet evolving customer expectations and support and enable business innovation and growth. Global financial institutions like us have experienced a significant increase in information and cyber security risk in recent years and will likely continue to be the target of increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks, including computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, ransomware, social engineering attacks (including phishing and impersonation), hacking, denial-of-service attacks and other attacks and similar disruptions from the unauthorized use of or access to computer systems. For more information on privacy, data protection and information and cyber security regulation and the potential impacts of a major information or cyber security incident on our results of operations and business, please see the Supervision and Regulation and Risk Factors sections of the 2017 Form 10-K. 54 Table of Contents Recently Issued Accounting Standards Refer to the Recently Issued Accounting Standards section of Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Glossary of Selected Terminology Adjusted net interest income A non-GAAP measure that represents net interest income attributable to our Card Member loans (which includes, on a GAAP basis, interest that is deemed uncollectible), excluding the impact of interest expense and interest income not attributable to our Card Member loans. We believe adjusted net interest income is useful to investors because it represents the interest expense and interest income attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio and it is a component of net interest yield on average Card Member loans. Asset securitizations Asset securitization involves the transfer and sale of loans or receivables to a special-purpose entity created for the securitization activity, typically a trust. The trust, in turn, issues securities, commonly referred to as asset-backed securities that are secured by the transferred loans and receivables. The trust uses the proceeds from the sale of such securities to pay the purchase price for the underlying loans or receivables. The loans and receivables of our Lending Trust and Charge Trust (collectively, the Trusts) securitized are reported as assets and the securities issued by the Trusts are reported as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Average discount rate This calculation is generally designed to reflect pricing at merchants accepting general purpose American Express cards. It represents the percentage of billed business (generated from both proprietary and GNS Card Member spending) retained by us from merchants we acquire, or for merchants acquired by a third party on our behalf, net of amounts retained by such third party. Basic cards-in-force Proprietary basic consumer cards-in-force includes basic cards issued to the primary account owner, (i.e., not including additional supplemental cards issued on accounts). Proprietary basic small business and corporate cards-in-force includes both basic and supplemental cards issued. Non-proprietary basic cards-in-force includes cards that are issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements, except for supplemental cards and retail cobrand Card Member accounts which have had no out-of-store spending activity during the prior twelve-month period. Billed business Includes activities (including cash advances) related to proprietary cards, cards issued under network partnership agreements (non-proprietary billed business), corporate payment services and certain insurance fees charged on proprietary cards. In-store spending activity within retail cobrand portfolios in GNS, from which we earn no revenue, is not included in non-proprietary billed business. Card billed business is included in the United States or outside the United States based on where the issuer is located. Capital ratios Represents the minimum standards established by the regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether the regulated entity has sufficient capital to absorb on- and off-balance sheet losses beyond current loss accrual estimates. Refer to the Capital Strategy section under Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity for further related definitions under Basel III. Card Member The individual holder of an issued American Express-branded charge, credit and certain prepaid cards. Card Member loans Represents the outstanding amount due from Card Members for charges made on their American Express credit cards, as well as any interest charges and card-related fees. Card Member loans also include revolving balances on certain American Express charge card products. Card Member receivables Represents the outstanding amount due from Card Members for charges made on their American Express charge cards, as well as any card-related fees, other than revolving balances on certain American Express charge cards with Pay Over Time features. Such revolving balances are included within Card Member loans. Charge cards Represents cards that generally carry no pre-set spending limits and are primarily designed as a method of payment and not as a means of financing purchases. Charge Card Members generally must pay the full amount billed each month. No finance charges are assessed on charge cards. Each charge card transaction is authorized based on its likely economics reflecting a Card Member most recent credit information and spend patterns. Some charge card accounts have additional Pay Over Time feature(s) that allow revolving of certain charges. Cobrand cards Cards issued under cobrand agreements with selected commercial firms. Pursuant to the cobrand agreements, we make payments to our cobrand partners, which can be significant, based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained. In some cases, the partner is liable for providing rewards to the Card Member under the cobrand partner own loyalty program. 55 Table of Contents Credit cards Represents cards that have a range of revolving payment terms, grace periods, and rate and fee structures. Discount revenue Represents revenue earned from fees generally charged to merchants who have entered into a card acceptance agreement. The discount fee generally is deducted from our payment for Card Member purchases. Interest expense Includes interest incurred primarily to fund Card Member loans and receivables, general corporate purposes and liquidity needs, and is recognized as incurred. Interest expense is divided principally into two categories: (i) deposits, which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions, and (ii) debt, which primarily relates to interest expense on our long-term financing and short-term borrowings, (e.g., commercial paper, federal funds purchased, bank overdrafts and other short-term borrowings), as well as the realized impact of derivatives hedging interest rate risk on our long-term debt. Interest income Includes (i) interest on loans, (ii) interest and dividends on investment securities and (iii) interest income on deposits with banks and other. Interest on loans Assessed using the average daily balance method for Card Member loans. Unless the loan is classified as non-accrual, interest is recognized based upon the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the terms of the applicable account agreement until the outstanding balance is paid or written off. Interest and dividends on investment securities Primarily relates to our performing fixed-income securities. Interest income is recognized as earned using the effective interest method, which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts, fees and other payments, so a constant rate of return is recognized on the outstanding balance of the related investment security throughout its term. Amounts are recognized until securities are in default or when it is likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled. Interest income on deposits with banks and other Recognized as earned, and primarily relates to the placement of cash in excess of near-term funding requirements in interest-bearing time deposits, overnight sweep accounts, and other interest-bearing demand and call accounts. Liquidity Coverage Ratio Represents the minimum standards established by regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether the regulated entity has sufficient liquidity to meet liquidity needs in periods of financial and economic stress. Merchant acquisition Represents our process of entering into agreements with merchants to accept American Express-branded cards. Net card fees Represents the card membership fees earned during the period. These fees are recognized as revenue over the covered card membership period (typically one year), net of the provision for projected refunds for Card Membership cancellation and deferred acquisition costs. Net interest yield on average Card Member loans A non-GAAP measure that is computed by dividing adjusted net interest income by average Card Member loans, computed on an annualized basis. Reserves and net write-offs related to uncollectible interest are recorded through provisions for losses, and are thus not included in the net interest yield calculation. We believe net interest yield on average Card Member loans is useful to investors because it provides a measure of profitability of our Card Member loan portfolio. Net loss ratio Represents the ratio of GCP charge card write-offs, consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions) and fee components, less recoveries, on Card Member receivables expressed as a percentage of gross amounts billed to corporate Card Members. Net write-off rate principal only Represents the amount of proprietary consumer or small business Card Member loans or receivables written off, consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions), less recoveries, as a percentage of the average loan or receivables balance during the period. Net write-off rate principal, interest and fees Includes, in the calculation of the net write-off rate, amounts for interest and fees in addition to principal for Card Member loans and fees in addition to principal for Card Member receivables. Operating expenses Represents salaries and employee benefits, professional services, occupancy and equipment, and other expenses. Return on average equity Calculated by dividing one-year period net income by one-year average total shareholders equity. Total cards-in-force Represents the total number of charge and credit cards that are issued and outstanding and accepted on our network. Non-proprietary cards-in-force includes all charge and credit cards that are issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements, except for retail cobrand Card Member accounts which have no out-of-store spending activity during the prior twelve-month period. 56 Table of Contents
