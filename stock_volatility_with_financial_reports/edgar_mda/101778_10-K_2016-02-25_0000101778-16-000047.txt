Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and the other financial information found elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The following discussion includes forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties. See "Disclosures Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" (immediately prior to Part I) and Item 1A. Risk Factors. Each of our segments is organized and managed based upon both geographic location and the nature of the products and services it offers: North America E&P explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas in North America; International E&P explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas outside of North America and produces and markets products manufactured from natural gas, such as LNG and methanol, in E.G.; and Oil Sands Mining mines, extracts and transports bitumen from oil sands deposits in Alberta, Canada, and upgrades the bitumen to produce and market synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil. Executive Summary We were able to increase net sales volumes by 20% in the three core U.S. resource plays despite a significant reduction in capital expenditures caused by the deterioration in commodity prices during 2015. Our focus on cost discipline and efficiencies yielded sustainable savings in both operating expenses and capital costs. We prioritized capital allocation to our domestic unconventional resource plays and scaled back our conventional exploration program. We continued to progress our program of non-core asset sales and realized aggregate net proceeds of $225 million . We ended 2015 with liquidity of $4.2 billion comprised of $1.2 billion of cash and $3.0 billion available through a committed multi-year credit facility. Despite current commodity prices, we believe that we can satisfy operational objectives and capital commitments with the cash and cash equivalents on hand, internally generated cash flow from operations, available borrowing capacity, the flexibility to adjust our Capital Program and our non-core asset disposition program. Our target for non-core asset dispositions is now $750 million to $1 billion, an increase from our previous goal of $500 million. Significant 2015 operating and financial activities include the following: Increased company-wide net sales volumes from continuing operations by 6% to 438 mboed from 415 mboed Net sales volumes from our three U.S. resource plays increased 20% to 218 mboed from 181 mboed Maintained focus on cost discipline and efficiencies Reduced our 2015 Capital Program by approximately 50% from the prior year, down to $3 billion, reflecting continued capital discipline and benefits from operating efficiencies Reduced company-wide production expenses per boe in 2015 North America E&P - 28% reduction to $7.38 per boe International E&P - 28% reduction to $5.99 per boe Rationalized the workforce during 2015, and expect to generate a future annualized net savings of $160 million from a 20% reduction in workforce Active management of liquidity and capital structure At December 31, 2015: Liquidity of $4.2 billion Cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 25% Issued $2 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes, $1 billion of which was used to repay the 0.90% senior notes that matured in November 2015 Increased the capacity of the revolving credit facility to $3.0 billion while also extending the maturity date to May 2020 Repatriated Canadian earnings in a tax efficient manner, providing $250 million of cash available for use in U.S. operations Reduced the quarterly dividend beginning in the third quarter, from $0.21 per share to $0.05 per share Portfolio management activities We continue to make progress in our non-core asset divestitures, with a goal of $750 million to $1 billion Closed on the sale of our East Texas, North Louisiana and Wilburton, Oklahoma natural gas assets in August 2015 for net proceeds of approximately $100 million Closed on the sale of certain Gulf of Mexico properties in December 2015 for net cash proceeds of $111 million 37 Signed an agreement for the sale of our East Africa exploration acreage in Kenya and Ethiopia; the Kenya transaction closed in February 2016 and Ethiopia is expected to close during the first quarter of 2016. Financial results Loss from continuing operations per diluted share of $3.26 in 2015 as compared to income from continuing operations of $1.42 per diluted share in 2014, reflecting the impact of lower commodity prices Included in the loss for 2015 are $1.4 billion ($1.7 billion pre-tax) of charges comprised largely of losses and asset impairments resulting from lower forecasted commodity prices, goodwill impairment and changes in our conventional exploration strategy (refer to North America E&P - Exploration and International E&P - Exploration in Item 1. Business) Recorded non-cash deferred tax expense of $135 million in 2015 related to the increase in Alberta's provincial corporate income tax rate Operating cash flow provided by continuing operations for 2015 was $1.6 billion , compared to $4.7 billion in 2014, reflecting the lower commodity price environment 38 Outlook Commodity prices are the most significant factor impacting our revenues, profitability, operating cash flows and the amount of capital available to reinvest into our business. Commodity prices began declining in the second half of 2014 and continued through 2015 and into 2016. We believe we can manage in this lower commodity price cycle through operational execution, efficiency improvements, cost reductions, capital discipline and portfolio optimization, while continuing to focus on balance sheet protection. Capital Program Our Board of Directors approved a Capital Program of $1.4 billion for 2016 . We intend to be flexible with respect to our capital allocation decisions in light of this challenged commodity pricing environment. With that in mind, we have engaged in an active program to divest of non-core assets, which together with our anticipated cash flows from operations, plus the savings embedded from the cost reductions we have put in place, should allow us to meet our current Capital Program, operating costs, debt service and dividends. The discipline undertaken as part of a real-time evaluation of our revenues, expenditures, and asset dispositions should allow us to live within our means. Our Capital Program is broken down by reportable segment in the table below: (In millions) 2016 Capital Program Percent of Total North America E&P $ 1,166 81 % International E&P 185 13 % Oil Sands Mining 41 3 % Segment total 1,392 97 % Corporate and other 40 3 % Total Capital Program $ 1,432 100 % North America E&P Approximately $1.2 billion of our Capital Program is allocated to our three core U.S. resource plays. Eagle Ford - Approximately $600 million is planned, we expect to average five rigs and bring 124-132 gross-operated wells to sales. Included in Eagle Ford spending is approximately $520 million for drilling and completions. The 2016 drilling program will continue to focus on the co-development of the Lower and Upper Eagle Ford horizons as well as Austin Chalk in the core of the play. Oklahoma Resource Basins - Spending of approximately $200 million is targeted, we expect to average two rigs which will focus primarily on lease retention in the STACK and delineation of the Meramec, and bring 20-22 gross-operated wells to sales. Spending includes approximately $195 million for drilling and completions, including $55 million for outside-operated activity. We expect to be approximately 70% held by production in the STACK by year end, with SCOOP already 90% held by production. Bakken - We plan to spend just under $200 million in North Dakota. Drilling activity will average one rig for half of 2016 and bring online 13-15 gross-operated wells. Bakken spending includes approximately $150 million for drilling and completions, including $75 million for outside-operated activity. Facilities and infrastructure spending will be significantly lower than 2015 with the next phase of the water-gathering system scheduled to be complete in the second half of 2016. International E&P Approximately $170 million of our Capital Program is dedicated to our international assets, primarily in E.G. and the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. The Alba field compression project in E.G. remains on schedule to start up by mid-year, and will extend plateau production by two years as well as the asset life by up to eight years. Approximately $30 million of our Capital Program will be spent on a targeted exploration program impacting both the North America E&P and the International E&P segments. Activity in 2016 is limited to fulfilling existing commitments in the Gulf of Mexico and Gabon, with no operated exploration wells planned. Oil Sands Mining We expect to spend $40 million of the Capital Program for sustaining capital projects. The remainder of our Capital Program consists of Corporate and Other and is expected to total approximately $40 million. For information about expected exploration and development activities more specific to individual assets, see Item 1. Business. Production Volumes We forecast 2016 production available for sale from the combined North America E&P and International E&P segments, excluding Libya, to average 335 to 355 net mboed and the OSM segment to average 40 to 50 net mbbld of synthetic crude oil. 39 Acquisitions and Dispositions Excluded from our Capital Program are the impacts of acquisitions and dispositions not previously announced. We continually evaluate ways to optimize our portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures. In connection with our ongoing portfolio management, future decisions to dispose of assets could result in non-cash impairments in the period such decisions are made. Operations Our net sales volumes from continuing operations averaged 438 mboed, 415 mboed and 404 mboed for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 . As liftings from Libya were sporadic during this 3-year period, a more representative comparison is net sales volumes from continuing operations excluding Libya, which was 438 mboed, 408 mboed and 376 mboed for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 . The continued ramp up of production from our U.S. resource plays has been the most significant contributor to the increases when comparing results excluding Libya, partially offset by decreases from domestic asset sales and normal production declines. Net Sales Volumes 2015 Increase (Decrease) 2014 Increase (Decrease) 2013 North America E&P (mboed) 269 13 % 238 18 % 201 International E&P (mboed) 116 (9 )% 127 (18 )% 155 Oil Sands Mining (mbbld) (a) 53 6 % 50 4 % 48 Total Continuing Operations (mboed) 438 6 % 415 3 % 404 (a) Includes blendstocks. North America E&P The following tables provide additional detail regarding net sales volumes, sales mix and operational drilling activity: Net Sales Volumes 2015 Increase (Decrease) 2014 Increase (Decrease) 2013 Eagle Ford 134 20% 112 38% 81 Oklahoma Resource Basins 25 39% 18 29% 14 Bakken 59 16% 51 31% 39 Other North America (a) 51 (11)% 57 (15)% 67 Total North America E&P (mboed) 269 13% 238 18% 201 (a) Includes Gulf of Mexico and other conventional onshore U.S. production, plus Alaska in 2013.

Net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes increase d 24 mbbld and net natural gas sales volumes increase d 41 mmcfd in 2015 primarily reflecting continued growth from our three core U.S. resource plays. North America E&P segment average net sales volumes in 2014 increased 18% when compared to 2013 , primarily due to higher liquid hydrocarbon net sales volumes resulting from ongoing development programs in our three key U.S. resource plays. This was partially offset by lower natural gas sales volumes, primarily due to the shut-in and exit from Powder River Basin operations. Refer to the Item 1. Business section for additional detail related to net sales volumes by asset. International E&P The following table provides net sales volumes from continuing operations: Net Sales Volumes 2015 Increase (Decrease) 2014 Increase (Decrease) 2013 Equivalent Barrels (mboed) Equatorial Guinea 97 (7 )% 104 (3 )% 107 United Kingdom (a) 19 19 % 16 (20 )% 20 Libya (100 )% 7 (75 )% 28 Total International E&P (mboed) 116 (9 )% 127 (18 )% 155 Net Sales Volumes of Equity Method Investees LNG (mtd) 5,884 (10 )% 6,535 % 6,548 Methanol (mtd) 937 (14 )% 1,092 (13 )% 1,249 (a) Includes natural gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale of 8 mmcfd, 6 mmcfd and 7 mmcfd for 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 . International E&P segment average net sales volumes in 2015 decrease d 9% when compared to 2014 . We did not record any sales from Libya in 2015 as a result of the shutdown of the Es Sider crude oil terminal and ongoing civil unrest. Sales volumes in Equatorial Guinea were lower due to a series of turnarounds and other maintenance activities performed at the Alba field, EG LNG and AMPCO facilities during the year. In the U.K., sales volumes increased as we completed the five-well Brae infill drilling program that began in 2014. The Brae Alpha installation experienced a process pipe failure in December 2015. Repairs are underway and full production is expected to resume in the second quarter of 2016. International E&P segment average net sales volumes in 2014 decreased 18% when compared to 2013 . We had lower sales from Libya in 2014 as a result of the shutdown of the Es Sider crude oil terminal which was temporarily re-opened during the second half of 2014. Excluding Libya, net sales volumes decreased 6%, primarily due to reliability issues and production decline in the U.K. and lower reliability at the non-operated methanol facility in E.G. Refer to the Item 1. Business section for additional detail related to net sales volumes by asset. Oil Sands Mining Our OSM operations consist of a 20% non-operated working interest in the AOSP. Our net synthetic crude oil sales volumes were 53 mbbld in 2015 compared to 50 mbbld in 2014 and 48 mbbld in 2013 . 41 Market Conditions Oil and gas price declines during 2015 and into 2016 are reflective of robust supply growth from both OPEC and non-OPEC production around the world. The effect of this supply growth on prices was exacerbated by weakening demand growth in emerging markets and OPEC's formal abandonment of production targets in December 2015. Crude oil, natural gas and NGLs benchmark prices are likely to remain volatile based on global supply and demand and declined further subsequent to December 31, 2015 as compared to the average realized prices in the tables below. See Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, Cash Flows and Liquidity Critical Accounting Estimates for further discussion of how a further decline in commodity prices could impact us. North America E&P The following table presents our average price realizations and the related benchmarks for crude oil, NGLs and natural gas for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 : 2015 Decrease 2014 Decrease 2013 Average Price Realizations (a) Crude Oil and Condensate (per bbl) (b) $43.50 (49 )% $85.25 (9 )% 94.19 Natural Gas Liquids (per bbl) 13.37 (60 )% 33.42 (5 )% 35.12 Total Liquid Hydrocarbons (per bbl) 37.85 (51 )% 77.02 (10 )% 85.20 Natural Gas (per mcf) 2.66 (42 )% 4.57 19 % 3.84 Benchmarks WTI crude oil average of daily prices (per bbl) $48.76 (48 )% $92.91 (5 )% 98.05 LLS crude oil average of daily prices (per bbl) 52.33 (46 )% 96.64 (10 )% 107.36 Mont Belvieu NGLs (per bbl) (c) 16.94 (48 )% 32.52 (4 )% 33.78 Henry Hub natural gas settlement date average (per mmbtu) 2.66 (40 )% 4.42 21 % 3.65 (a) Excludes gains or losses on derivative instruments. (b) Inclusion of realized gains (losses) on crude oil derivative instruments would have increased (decreased) average liquid hydrocarbon price realizations per barrel by $1.24 and $(0.27) for 2015 and 2013 . There were no crude oil derivative instruments for 2014 . (c) Bloomberg Finance LLP: Y-grade Mix NGL of 50% ethane, 25% propane, 10% butane, 5% isobutane and 10% natural gasoline. Crude oil and condensate Our crude oil and condensate price realizations may differ from the benchmark due to the quality and location of the product. Natural gas liquids The majority of our NGLs volumes are sold at reference to Mont Belvieu prices. Natural gas A significant portion of our natural gas production in the U.S. is sold at bid-week prices, or first-of-month indices relative to our specific producing areas. International E&P The following table presents our average price realizations and the related benchmark for crude oil for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 : 2015 Decrease 2014 Decrease 2013 Average Price Realizations Crude Oil and Condensate (per bbl) $47.50 (46 )% $87.23 (19 )% $108.18 Natural Gas Liquids (per bbl) 2.81 14 % 2.46 (53 )% 5.24 Total Liquid Hydrocarbons (per bbl) 36.67 (47 )% 68.98 (24 )% 91.04 Natural Gas (per mcf) 0.68 (6 )% 0.72 (37 )% 1.15 Benchmark Brent (Europe) crude oil (per bbl) (a) $52.35 (47 )% $99.02 (9 )% $108.64 (a) Average of monthly prices obtained from EIA website. Our U.K. liquid hydrocarbon production is generally sold in relation to the Brent crude benchmark. Our production from the Alba field in E.G. is condensate and gas. Condensate is sold at market prices. The Alba Plant extracts NGLs and secondary condensate from gas, leaving dry natural gas. The processed NGLs are sold by Alba Plant at market prices, with our share of its income/loss reflected in Income from equity method investments. The dry natural gas from Alba Plant is supplied to AMPCO and EGHoldings under long-term contracts at fixed prices; therefore, our reported average realized prices for NGLs and natural gas will not fully track market price movements. Because of the location and limited local demand for natural gas in E.G., we consider the prices under the contracts with Alba Plant LLC, EGHoldings and AMPCO to be comparable to the price that could be realized from transactions with unrelated parties in this market under the same or similar circumstances. EGHoldings and AMPCO process the gas into LNG and methanol, which are sold at market prices, with our share of their income/loss reflected 42 in the Income from equity method investments line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Although uncommon, any dry gas not sold is returned offshore and re-injected into the Alba field for later production. Oil Sands Mining The Oil Sands Mining segment produces and sells various qualities of synthetic crude oil. Output mix can be impacted by operational reliability or planned unit outages at the mines or upgrader. Sales prices for synthetic crude oil historically tracked movements in the WTI crude oil and the WCS Canadian heavy crude oil benchmarks. The influence of each benchmark can change from period to period based on market dynamics. The following table presents our average price realizations and the related benchmarks that impacted both our revenues and variable costs for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 : 2015 Increase (Decrease) 2014 Increase (Decrease) 2013 Average Price Realizations Synthetic Crude Oil (per bbl) $40.13 (52 %) $83.35 (5 %) $87.51 Benchmark WTI crude oil (per bbl) $48.76 (48 %) $92.91 (5 %) $98.05 WCS crude oil (per bbl) (a) 35.28 (52 %) 73.60 1 % 72.77 (a) Average of monthly prices based upon average WTI adjusted for differentials unique to western Canada. Consolidated Results of Operations: 2015 compared to 2014 Sales and other operating revenues, including related party are summarized by segment in the following table: Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2015 2014 Sales and other operating revenues, including related party North America E&P $ 3,358 $ 5,770 International E&P 728 1,410 Oil Sands Mining 815 1,556 Segment sales and other operating revenues, including related party 4,901 8,736 Unrealized gain on crude oil derivative instruments 50 Sales and other operating revenues, including related party $ 4,951 $ 8,736 43 Below is a price/volume analysis for each segment. Refer to the preceding Operations and Market Conditions sections for additional detail related to our net sales volumes and average price realizations. Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) Related to Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2014 Price Realizations Net Sales Volumes 2015 North America E&P Price-Volume Analysis Liquid hydrocarbons $ 5,240 $ (3,006 ) $ 671 $ 2,905 Natural gas 516 (243 ) 68 341 Realized gain on crude oil derivative instruments 78 78 Other sales 14 34 Total $ 5,770 $ 3,358 International E&P Price-Volume Analysis Liquid hydrocarbons $ 1,240 $ (509 ) $ (153 ) $ 578 Natural gas 124 (8 ) (8 ) 108 Other sales 46 42 Total $ 1,410 $ 728 Oil Sands Mining Price-Volume Analysis Synthetic crude oil $ 1,525 $ (842 ) $ 98 $ 781 Other sales 31 34 Total $ 1,556 $ 815 Marketing revenues decreased $1,539 million in 2015 from 2014 . Marketing activities include the purchase of commodities from third parties for resale and serve to aggregate volumes in order to satisfy transportation commitments as well as to achieve flexibility within product types and delivery points. Since the volume of marketing activity is based on market dynamics, it can fluctuate from period to period. The decreases are primarily related to the lower commodity price environment as well as lower marketed volumes in North America. Income from equity method investments decreased $279 million primarily due to lower price realizations for LPG at our Alba Plant, LNG at our LNG facility and lower methanol prices at our AMPCO methanol facility, all of which are located in E.G. Also contributing to the decrease were lower sales volumes due to planned turnaround and maintenance activities at the AMPCO methanol plant, the Alba field and the LNG facility. Net gain on disposal of assets in 2015 was related to the sale of our operated producing properties in the greater Ewing Bank area and non-operated producing interests in the Petronius field in the Gulf of Mexico. The gain associated with those assets was partially offset by the loss on sale of East Africa exploration acreage in Ethiopia and Kenya. The net loss on disposal of assets in 2014 was primarily related to the sale of non-core acreage located in the far northwest portion of the Williston Basin. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for information about these dispositions. Production expenses decreased $552 million in 2015 from 2014 . Our focus on cost discipline and efficiencies yielded sustainable savings in production costs. North America E&P declined $167 million due to lower operational, maintenance and labor costs. International E&P declined $131 million due to lower project work, repair, maintenance and turnaround costs, as well as lower production volumes. OSM declined $254 million primarily due to cost management, especially staffing and contract labor, lower fuel and utility costs, and lower feedstock purchases given the increased mine and upgrader reliability, combined with a more favorable exchange rate on expenses denominated in the Canadian dollar. The production expense rate (expense rate per boe) decreased for each of our segments as total production costs declined due to reasons described in the preceding paragraph. The North America E&P and OSM segments also experienced volume increases, which further contributed to the expense rate decline. The following table provides production expense rates for each segment: 44 ($ per boe) 2015 2014 North America E&P $7.38 $10.25 International E&P $5.99 $8.31 Oil Sands Mining (a) $36.48 $44.53 (a) Production expense per synthetic crude oil barrel (before royalties) includes production costs, shipping and handling, taxes other than income and insurance costs and excludes pre-development costs. Marketing expenses decreased $1,536 million in 2015 from the prior year, consistent with the decrease in marketing revenues discussed above. Exploration expenses increased $525 million in 2015, primarily due to higher unproved property impairments in North America. During 2015, we made a strategic decision to reduce the overall level of our conventional exploration program; as a result, we impaired our Canadian in-situ assets, certain of our leases in the Gulf of Mexico and the Harir block in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. We also impaired unproved property in Colorado in 2015, which we deemed uneconomic given our forecasted natural gas prices. Unproved property impairments in 2014 primarily were a result of Eagle Ford and Bakken leases that either expired or we decided not to drill or extend. Dry well costs for 2015 include the operated Solomon well in the Gulf of Mexico, our operated Sodalita West #1 exploratory well in E.G., and suspended well costs related to our Canadian in-situ assets at Birchwood. Dry well costs in 2014 also included our operated Sodalita West #1 exploratory well in E.G. which was drilling over year-end 2014, the operated Key Largo well, outside-operated Perseus well and the outside operated second Shenandoah appraisal well, all of which are located in the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, 2014 also includes our exploration programs in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, Ethiopia and Kenya. The following table summarizes the components of exploration expenses: Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2015 2014 Unproved property impairments $ 964 $ 306 Dry well costs 250 317 Geological and geophysical 31 85 Other 73 85 Total exploration expenses $ 1,318 $ 793 Exploration expense are also discussed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $96 million in 2015 from the prior year primarily as a result of higher North America E&P net sales volumes from our three U.S. resource plays. Our segments apply the units-of-production method to the majority of their assets, including capitalized asset retirement costs; therefore, proved reserve and production volumes have an impact on DD&A expense. The DD&A rate (expense rate per boe), which is impacted by changes in proved reserves, capitalized costs and sales volume mix by field, can also cause changes to our DD&A. The following table provides DD&A rates for each segment. The DD&A rate for North America E&P decreased primarily as a result of a higher proved reserve base in the Eagle Ford. The International E&P rate increased primarily due to higher sales volumes from the Brae infill drilling program. ($ per boe) 2015 2014 North America E&P $24.24 $26.95 International E&P $6.95 $5.79 Oil Sands Mining $12.48 $12.07 Impairments for 2015 included $340 million for the goodwill impairment of the North America E&P reporting unit, $335 million related to proved properties (primarily in Colorado and the Gulf of Mexico) as a result of lower forecasted commodity prices and $44 million associated with our disposition of natural gas assets in East Texas, North Louisiana and Wilburton, Oklahoma. Impairments for 2014 consisted primarily of proved properties in the Gulf of Mexico, Texas and North Dakota as a result of revisions to estimated abandonment costs and lower forecasted commodity prices. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 13 and Note 14 to the consolidated financial statement for additional detail. Taxes other than income include production, severance and ad valorem taxes, primarily in the U.S., which tend to increase or decrease in relation to revenue and sales volumes. With the decrease in North America E&P revenues due to lower price 45 realizations, taxes other than income decreased $172 million in 2015 . This decrease was partially offset by an increase in sales volumes in North America E&P. The following table summarizes the components of taxes other than income: Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2015 2014 Production and severance $ 131 $ 240 Ad valorem 39 74 Other 64 92 Total $ 234 $ 406 General and administrative expenses decreased $64 million primarily due to cost savings realized from the workforce reductions that occurred during 2015. This decrease was partially offset by severance expenses of $55 million associated with the workforce reductions and an increase in pension settlement expense. Pension settlement expenses in 2015 totaled $119 million as compared to $99 million in 2014. Net interest and other increased $29 million primarily due to increased interest expense associated with an increase in long-term debt. The components of net interest and other are detailed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. Provision (benefit) for income taxes reflects an effective tax rate of (25%) and 29% for each of 2015 and 2014. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the effective income tax rate. Discontinued operations is presented net of tax. We closed the sale of our Angola assets and Norway business in 2014, and both are reflected as discontinued operations for 2014. Included in the discontinued operations for 2014 are after-tax gains of $532 million and $976 million related to the dispositions of Angola and Norway respectively. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. Segment Results: 2015 compared to 2014 Segment income (loss) for 2015 and 2014 is summarized and reconciled to net income (loss) in the following table. Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2015 2014 North America E&P $ (486 ) $ 693 International E&P 112 568 Oil Sands Mining (113 ) 235 Segment income (loss) (487 ) 1,496 Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes (1,717 ) (527 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations (2,204 ) 969 Discontinued operations 2,077 Net income (loss) $ (2,204 ) $ 3,046 North America E&P segment income (loss) decreased $1,179 million in 2015 compared to 2014 . The decrease was primarily due to lower price realizations, which was partially offset by the impacts from the increased net sales volumes from the three U.S resource plays and lower production costs (even though net sales volumes increased). International E&P segment income decreased $456 million in 2015 compared to 2014 . The decrease was largely due to lower liquid hydrocarbon price realizations as well as reduced income from equity investments. These declines were partially offset by lower production, operating and exploration expenses. Oil Sands Mining segment income (loss) decreased $348 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily as result of lower price realizations, partially offset by higher sales volumes and reduced production expenses. 46 Consolidated Results of Operations: 2014 compared to 2013 Sales and other operating revenues, including related party are summarized by segment in the following table: Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2014 2013 Sales and other operating revenues, including related party North America E&P $ 5,770 $ 5,068 International E&P 1,410 2,654 Oil Sands Mining 1,556 1,576 Segment sales and other operating revenues, including related party 8,736 9,298 Unrealized gain (loss) on crude oil derivative instruments (52 ) Sales and other operating revenues, including related party $ 8,736 $ 9,246 Below is a price/volume analysis for each segment. Refer to the preceding Operations and Market Conditions sections for additional detail related to our net sales and average price realizations. Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) Related to Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2013 Price Realizations Net Sales Volumes 2014 North America E&P Price-Volume Analysis Liquid hydrocarbons $ 4,638 $ (557 ) $ 1,159 $ 5,240 Natural gas 437 82 (3 ) 516 Realized gain on crude oil derivative instruments (15 ) 15 Other sales 8 14 Total $ 5,068 $ 5,770 International E&P Price-Volume Analysis Liquid hydrocarbons $ 2,398 $ (397 ) $ (761 ) $ 1,240 Natural gas 209 (74 ) (11 ) 124 Other sales 47 46 Total $ 2,654 $ 1,410 Oil Sands Mining Price-Volume Analysis Synthetic crude oil $ 1,542 $ (76 ) $ 59 $ 1,525 Other sales 34 31 Total $ 1,576 $ 1,556 Marketing revenues increased $31 million in 2014 from 2013 . Marketing activities include the purchase of commodities from third parties for resale and serve to aggregate volumes in order to satisfy transportation commitments as well as to achieve flexibility within product types and delivery points. Since the volume of marketing activity is based on market dynamics, it can fluctuate from period to period. The increase in 2014 is primarily due to higher marketing activity levels in both the North America E&P and OSM segments. Net loss on disposal of assets in 2014 primarily includes the pretax loss on the sale of non-core acreage located in the far northwest portion of the Williston Basin. The net loss on disposal of assets in 2013 primarily included pretax losses on the sale of our DJ Basin interests and the conveyance of our Marcellus interests to the operator, partially offset by pretax gains on the sales of the Neptune gas plant and our remaining assets in Alaska. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further details about these dispositions. Production expenses increased $90 million in 2014 from 2013 primarily related to increased North America E&P net sales volumes in the Eagle Ford and Bakken. The production expense rate (expense per boe) decreased in North America E&P in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to improved operating efficiencies in the Eagle Ford . The expense per boe increased in the International E&P segment due to a subsea power project at our non-operated Foinaven field as well as a turnaround in Brae in the U.K. and a non-recurring riser repair in E.G. 47 The following table provides production expense rates for each segment: ($ per boe) 2014 2013 North America E&P $10.25 $10.86 International E&P $8.31 $6.36 Oil Sands Mining (a) $44.53 $46.30 (a) Production expense per synthetic crude oil barrel (before royalties) includes production costs, shipping and handling, taxes other than income and insurance costs and excludes pre-development costs. Other operating expenses increased $73 million in 2014 from the prior year, primarily due to increased shipping and handling costs in North America in line with increased sales volumes, as well as the impact of a settlement related to the calculation of the net profits interest payments associated with our Alba Plant equity interests in E.G. Marketing expenses increased $29 million in 2014 from the prior year, consistent with the decreases in marketing revenues discussed above. Exploration expenses were $98 million lower in 2014 than in 2013 , primarily related to our North America E&P segment as a result of larger non-cash unproved property impairments during 2013 related to Eagle Ford leases that either expired or that we did not expect to drill. These decreases were partially offset by increases in 2014 expenses related to the operated Key Largo, the outside-operated Perseus, the outside-operated second Shenandoah appraisal well in the Gulf of Mexico and our operated Sodalita West #1 exploratory well in E.G. The following table summarizes the components of exploration expenses: Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2014 2013 Unproved property impairments $ 306 $ 572 Dry well costs 317 148 Geological and geophysical 85 80 Other 85 91 Total exploration expenses $ 793 $ 891 Exploration expense are also discussed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $361 million in 2014 from the prior year. Our segments apply the units-of-production method to the majority of their assets, including capitalized asset retirement costs; therefore, proved reserve and production volumes have an impact on DD&A expense. Increased DD&A expense in 2014 is primarily due to higher North America E&P sales volumes as a result of ongoing development programs over our three U.S. resource plays. The DD&A rate, which is impacted by changes in reserves, capitalized costs and sales volume mix by field, can also cause changes to our DD&A. The following table provides DD&A rates for each segment: ($ per boe) 2014 2013 North America E&P $26.95 $26.23 International E&P $5.79 $5.86 Oil Sands Mining $12.07 $12.39 Impairments for 2014 consisted primarily of proved properties in the Gulf of Mexico, Texas and North Dakota as a result of revisions to estimated abandonment costs and lower forecasted commodity prices. Impairments in 2013 primarily related to a second LNG production train in E.G., the Ozona development in the Gulf of Mexico and our Powder River asset in Wyoming. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for information about these impairments. 48 Taxes other than income include production, severance and ad valorem taxes, primarily in the U.S., which tend to increase or decrease in relation to revenues and sales volumes. Taxes other than income increased $61 million in 2014 from 2013 , consistent with similar increases in the North America E&P Segment. Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2014 2013 Production and severance $ 240 $ 202 Ad valorem 74 61 Other 92 82 Total $ 406 $ 345 Net interest and other decreased $40 million in 2014 from 2013 primarily due to an increase in capitalized interest, higher net foreign currency gains and a dividend received in 2014 from a mutual insurance company of which we are an owner. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed information. Provision for income taxes reflects an effective tax rate of 29% and 61% for each of 2014 and 2013. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the effective income tax rate. Discontinued operations is presented net of tax. We closed the sale of our Angola assets and our Norway business in 2014, and both are reflected as discontinued operations and excluded from the International E&P segment in 2014 and 2013. Included in discontinued operations for 2014 are after-tax gains of $532 million and $976 million related to the dispositions of Angola and Norway, respectively. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. Segment Results: 2014 compared to 2013 Segment income for 2014 and 2013 is summarized and reconciled to net income in the following table. Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2014 2013 North America E&P $ 693 $ 529 International E&P 568 758 Oil Sands Mining 235 206 Segment income 1,496 1,493 Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes (527 ) (562 ) Income from continuing operations 969 931 Discontinued operations 2,077 822 Net income $ 3,046 $ 1,753 North America E&P segment income increased $164 million in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase was largely due to increased liquid hydrocarbon net sales volumes primarily in the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Oklahoma Resource Basins and lower exploration expenses, partially offset by lower average price realizations. International E&P segment income decreased $190 million in 2014 compared to 2013. The decrease was primarily due to lower liquid hydrocarbon net sales volumes and lower average price realizations partially offset by a decrease in the taxes related to Libya, a high tax jurisdiction. Also, other operating expenses were higher in 2014 primarily due to the impact of a settlement related to the calculation of the net profits interest payments associated with our Alba Plant equity interests in E.G. Oil Sands Mining segment income increased $29 million in 2014 compared to 2013. This increase was primarily a result of higher operating expenses in 2013 related to a turnaround. 49 Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, Cash Flows and Liquidity Commodity prices are the most significant factor impacting our operating cash flows and the amount of capital available to reinvest into the business. The substantial decline in commodity prices that began in the second half of 2014 and continued into 2016 adversely affected our cash flows. In response to the lower commodity price environment, actions undertaken to protect our liquidity and capital structure include: Decreased our quarterly dividend from $0.21 to $0.05 per share, saving $425 million of cash on an annualized basis Scaled back our conventional exploration program to focus on our U.S. unconventional resources plays Reduced cash capital expenditures to $3.476 billion , a 33% decrease compared to 2014 Announced a 2016 Capital Program of $1.4 billion Improved cost structure by reducing North America and International E&P production expenses 24% versus 2014 Expect future G&A costs to be lower by $160 million on an annualized basis as a result of 2015 workforce reductions Issued $2 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes, $1 billion of which was used to repay the 0.90% senior notes that matured in November 2015 Increased the capacity of the revolving credit facility from $2.5 billion to $3.0 billion while also extending the maturity date an additional year to May 2020 Repatriated Canadian earnings in a tax efficient manner, providing $250 million of cash available for use in U.S. operations Divested of certain non-core assets resulting in net proceeds of $ 225 million At December 31, 2015, we had approximately $4.2 billion of liquidity consisting of $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $3.0 billion availability under our revolving credit facility. As previously discussed in Outlook, we are targeting a $1.4 billion Capital Program for 2016. Given our objective of spending within our cash flow in 2016, we are evaluating and we will continue to evaluate our options, which include our non-core asset disposition program, the flexibility to adjust our Capital Program or to seek to raise additional capital through the issuance of debt or equity securities. We will also continue to drive the fundamentals of expense management, including organizational capacity and operational reliability. 50 Cash Flows The following table presents sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 : Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2015 2014 2013 Sources of cash and cash equivalents Continuing operations $ 1,565 $ 4,736 $ 4,388 Discontinued operations 751 882 Disposals of assets 225 3,760 450 Maturities of short-term investment 925 Borrowings, net 1,996 Other 91 214 189 Total sources of cash and cash equivalents $ 4,802 $ 9,461 $ 5,909 Uses of cash and cash equivalents Cash additions to property, plant and equipment $ (3,476 ) $ (5,160 ) $ (4,443 ) Purchases of short-term investments (925 ) Investing activities of discontinued operations (376 ) (550 ) Acquisitions (21 ) (74 ) Purchases of common stock (1,000 ) (500 ) Commercial paper, net (135 ) (65 ) Debt repayments (1,069 ) (68 ) (182 ) Debt issuance costs (19 ) Dividends paid (460 ) (543 ) (508 ) Other (30 ) (24 ) (7 ) Total uses of cash and cash equivalents $ (5,979 ) $ (7,327 ) $ (6,329 ) Cash flows from continuing operations in 2015 were lower than 2014 primarily as a result of commodity prices declines, which were partially offset by increased net sales volumes in the North America E&P segment. Cash flows from continuing operations in 2014 were higher than in 2013 due to increased net sales volumes in the North America E&P segment and lower cash tax payments (primarily Libya, a higher tax jurisdiction), partially offset by lower average price realizations in all segments, as well as lower net sales volumes in the International E&P segment. Cash flows from discontinued operations primarily related to our Norway business, which we disposed of in the fourth quarter of 2014. Disposals of assets in 2015 pertain to the sale of certain of our operated and non-operated producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico as well as natural gas assets in East Texas, North Louisiana and Wilburton, Oklahoma. Disposals in 2014 primarily reflect the proceeds from the sales of our Angola assets and our Norway business. In 2013, net proceeds were primarily related to the sales of our interests in Alaska, the Neptune gas plant and the DJ Basin. Disposition transactions are discussed in further detail in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. 51 Borrowings reflect net proceeds received from the issuance of senior notes in June 2015. See Liquidity and Capital Resources below for additional information. In November 2015, we repaid our $1 billion 0.90% senior notes upon maturity. In October 2015, we announced an adjustment to our quarterly dividend. See Capital Requirements below for additional information. Additions to property, plant and equipment are our most significant use of cash and cash equivalents. The following table shows capital expenditures related to continuing operations by segment and reconciles to additions to property, plant and equipment as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 : Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2015 2014 2013 North America E&P $ 2,553 $ 4,698 $ 3,649 International E&P 368 534 456 Oil Sands Mining (a) (10 ) 212 286 Corporate 25 51 58 Total capital expenditures 2,936 5,495 4,449 Change in capital expenditure accrual 540 (335 ) (6 ) Additions to property, plant and equipment $ 3,476 $ 5,160 $ 4,443 (a) Reflects reimbursements earned from the governments of Canada and Alberta related to funds previously expended for Quest CCS capital equipment. Quest CCS was successfully completed and commissioned in the fourth quarter of 2015. During 2014, we acquired 29 million shares at a cost of $1 billion and in 2013 acquired 14 million shares at a cost of $500 million. There were no share repurchases in 2015. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of purchases of common stock. Liquidity and Capital Resources On June 10, 2015, we issued $2 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes which consist of the following series: $600 million of 2.70% senior notes due June 1, 2020 $900 million of 3.85% senior notes due June 1, 2025 $500 million of 5.20% senior notes due June 1, 2045 Interest on each series of senior notes is payable semi-annually beginning December 1, 2015. We used the aggregate net proceeds to repay our $1 billion 0.90% senior notes on November 2, 2015, and the remainder for general corporate purposes. In May 2015, we amended our $2.5 billion Credit Facility to increase the facility size by $500 million to a total of $3.0 billion and extend the maturity date by an additional year such that the Credit Facility now matures in May 2020. The amendment additionally provides us the ability to request two one-year extensions to the maturity date and an option to increase the commitment amount by up to an additional $500 million, subject to the consent of any increasing lenders. The sub-facilities for swing-line loans and letters of credit remain unchanged allowing up to an aggregate amount of $100 million and $500 million, respectively. Fees on the unused commitment of each lender, as well as the borrowing options under the Credit Facility, remain unchanged. Our main sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, internally generated cash flow from operations, capital market transactions, our committed revolving credit facility and sales of non-core assets. Our working capital requirements are supported by these sources and we may issue either commercial paper backed by our $3.0 billion revolving credit facility or draw on our $3.0 billion revolving credit facility to meet short-term cash requirements or issue debt or equity securities through the shelf registration statement discussed below as part of our longer-term liquidity and capital management. Because of the alternatives available to us as discussed above, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements including our capital spending programs, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies. General economic conditions, commodity prices, and financial, business and other factors could affect our operations and our ability to access the capital markets. A downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively impact our cost of capital and our ability to access the capital markets, increase the interest rate and fees we pay on our unsecured revolving credit facility, restrict our access to the commercial paper market, or require us to post letters of credit or other forms of collateral for certain 52 obligations. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a further discussion of how a downgrade in our credit ratings, particularly below investment grade, could affect us. We may incur additional debt in order to fund our capital expenditures, acquisitions or development activities, or for general corporate or other purposes. A higher level of indebtedness could increase the risk that our liquidity and financial flexibility deteriorates. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a further discussion of how our level of indebtedness could affect us. Capital Resources Credit Arrangements and Borrowings At December 31, 2015 , we had no borrowings against our revolving credit facility and no amounts outstanding under our U.S. commercial paper program that is backed by the revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2015 , we had $7.3 billion in long-term debt outstanding. We do not have any triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an event of default in the case of a downgrade of our credit ratings. Shelf Registration We have a universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC, under which we, as "well-known seasoned issuer" for purposes of SEC rules, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities from time to time. Asset Disposals We are targeting to generate $750 million to $1 billion from select non-core asset sales. During 2015, we closed or announced asset sales in excess of $300 million (before closing adjustments) from this program by divesting of certain operated and non-operated producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico and natural gas assets in East Texas, North Louisiana and Wilburton, Oklahoma. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these dispositions. Cash-Adjusted Debt-To-Capital Ratio Our cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio (total debt-minus-cash to total debt-plus-equity-minus-cash) was 25% at December 31, 2015 and 16% at December 31, 2014 . (Dollars in millions) 2015 2014 Long-term debt due within one year $ 1 $ 1,068 Long-term debt 7,276 5,295 Total debt $ 7,277 $ 6,363 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,221 $ 2,398 Equity $ 18,553 $ 21,020 Calculation Total debt $ 7,277 $ 6,363 Minus cash and cash equivalents 1,221 2,398 Total debt minus cash and cash equivalents 6,056 3,965 Total debt $ 7,277 $ 6,363 Plus equity 18,553 21,020 Minus cash and cash equivalents 1,221 2,398 Total debt plus equity minus cash, cash equivalents $ 24,609 $ 24,985 Cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio 25 % 16 % Capital Requirements Capital Spending Our approved Capital Program for 2016 is $1.4 billion. Additional details were previously discussed in Outlook. Share Repurchase Program The remaining share repurchase authorization as of December 31, 2015 is $1.5 billion. Other Expected Cash Outflows On January 27, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.05 per share for the fourth quarter of 2015. The dividend is payable on March 10, 2016 to shareholders on record on February 17, 2016. The fourth quarter dividend is consistent with the third quarter of 2015, which was a reduction as compared to the quarterly dividends of $0.21 per share for each of the first and second quarters. We reduced the dividend as as we continue to address the uncertainty of a lower for 53 longer commodity price environment, align with our priority of maintaining a strong balance sheet through the cycle and provide additional capital flexibility to support growth from the U.S. resource plays when commodity prices improve. We plan to make contributions of up to $62 million to our funded pension plans during 2016 . Cash contributions to be paid from our general assets for the unfunded pension and postretirement plans are expected to be approximately $8 million and $21 million in 2016 . Contractual Cash Obligations The table below provides aggregated information on our consolidated obligations to make future payments under existing contracts as of December 31, 2015 . (In millions) Total 2016 2017- 2018 2019- 2020 Later Years Short and long-term debt (includes interest) (a) $ 11,870 $ 365 $ 2,196 $ 1,354 $ 7,955 Lease obligations 178 30 52 50 46 Purchase obligations: Oil and gas activities (b) 382 263 70 37 12 Service and materials contracts (c) 761 90 128 37 506 Transportation and related contracts 1,768 256 495 393 624 Drilling rigs and fracturing crews (d) 270 119 151 Other (g) 141 26 29 30 56 Total purchase obligations 3,322 754 873 497 1,198 Other long-term liabilities reported in the consolidated balance sheet (e) 618 94 158 113 253 Total contractual cash obligations (f) $ 15,988 $ 1,243 $ 3,279 $ 2,014 $ 9,452 (a) Includes anticipated cash payments for interest of $365 million for 2016 , $660 million for 2017-2018, $526 million for 2019-2020 and $3,018 million for the remaining years for a total of $4,569 million . (b) Oil and gas activities include contracts to acquire property, plant and equipment and commitments for oil and gas exploration such as costs related to contractually obligated exploratory work programs that are expensed immediately. (c) Service and materials contracts include contracts to purchase services such as utilities, supplies and various other maintenance and operating services. (d) Some contracts may be canceled at an amount less than the contract amount. Were we to elect that option where possible at December 31, 2015 our minimum commitment would be $163 million. (e) Primarily includes obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits including medical and life insurance. We have estimated projected funding requirements through 2025. Although unrecognized tax benefits are not a contractual obligation, they are presented in this table because they represent potential demands on our liquidity. (f) This table does not include the estimated discounted liability for dismantlement, abandonment and restoration costs of oil and gas properties of $1,635 million . See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements. (g) We expect to make severance payments of approximately $8 million in 2016 related to the workforce reduction in 2015. Transactions with Related Parties We own a 63% working interest in the Alba field offshore E.G. Onshore E.G., we own a 52% interest in an LPG processing plant, a 60% interest in an LNG production facility and a 45% interest in a methanol production plant, each through equity method investees. We sell our natural gas from the Alba field to these equity method investees as the feedstock for their production processes. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Off-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Although off-balance sheet arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes, we are not dependent on these arrangements to maintain our liquidity and capital resources, and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the off-balance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources. We will issue stand alone letters of credit when required by a business partner. Such letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 aggregated $53 million, $101 million and $119 million. Most of the letters of credit are in support of obligations recorded in the consolidated balance sheet. For example, they are issued to counterparties to insure our payments for outstanding company debt and future abandonment liabilities. 54 Management Discussion and Analysis of Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies We have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes. Legislation and regulations pertaining to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions have the potential to materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including costs of compliance and permitting delays. The extent and magnitude of these adverse impacts cannot be reliably or accurately estimated at this time because specific regulatory and legislative requirements have not been finalized and uncertainty exists with respect to the measures being considered, the costs and the time frames for compliance, and our ability to pass compliance costs on to our customers. For additional information see Item 1A. Risk Factors. We accrue for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated. As environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise, charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required. New or expanded environmental requirements, which could increase our environmental costs, may arise in the future. We strive to comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment, but as not all costs are fixed or presently determinable (even under existing legislation) and may be affected by future legislation or regulations, it is not possible to predict all of the ultimate costs of compliance, including remediation costs that may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed. For more information on environmental regulations that impact us, or could impact us, see Item 1. Business Environmental, Health and Safety Matters, Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 3. Legal Proceedings. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods. Accounting estimates are considered to be critical if (1) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and (2) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. Estimated Quantities of Net Reserves The estimation of quantities of net reserves is a highly technical process performed by our engineers for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas and by outside consultants for synthetic crude oil, which is based upon several underlying assumptions that are subject to change. Estimates of reserves may change, either positively or negatively, as additional information becomes available and as contractual, operational, economic and political conditions change. We evaluate our reserves using drilling results, reservoir performance, seismic interpretation and future plans to develop acreage. The data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. Consequently, material revisions (upward or downward) to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. Reserve estimates are based upon an unweighted average of commodity prices in the prior 12-month period, using the closing prices on the first day of each month. Further reductions in commodity prices could have a material effect on the quantity and present value of our proved reserves and could also cause further reductions to our near term capital programs which would defer investment until prices improved. A shifting of capital expenditures into future periods outside of five years from the initial proved reserve booking could potentially lead to a reduction in proved undeveloped reserves. Our December 31, 2015 proved reserves were calculated using the SEC pricing. The table below provides the 2015 SEC pricing for certain of the benchmark prices as well as the unweighted average for the first two months of 2016: 55 Unweighted 12-month 2015 Average Unweighted 2-month 2016 Average WTI Crude oil $ 50.28 $ 34.19 Henry Hub natural gas $ 2.59 $ 2.28 Brent crude oil $ 54.25 $ 34.86 Natural gas liquids $ 17.32 $ 12.87 When determining the December 31, 2015 proved reserves for each property, the benchmark prices listed above were adjusted using price differentials that account for property-specific quality and location differences. Beginning in the second half of 2014, the crude oil and Henry Hub benchmarks began to decline and these declines continued through 2015 and into 2016. Commodity prices are likely to remain volatile based on global supply and demand and could decline further. Sustained reduced commodity prices could have a material effect on the quantity and future cash flows of our proved reserves. For further discussion of risks associated with our estimation of proved reserves, see Part I. Item 1A Risk Factors. We use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities. The successful efforts method inherently relies on the estimation of proved crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves. The existence and the estimated amount of reserves affect, among other things, whether certain costs are capitalized or expensed, the amount and timing of costs depreciated, depleted or amortized into net income and the presentation of supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities. Additionally, both the expected future cash flows to be generated by oil and gas producing properties used in testing such properties for impairment and the expected future taxable income available to realize deferred tax assets also rely, in part, on estimates of quantities of net reserves. Accordingly, a decline in estimates of quantities of net proved reserves could cause us to perform an impairment analysis to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value and could result in an impairment charge. In addition, a decline in estimates of quantities of net proved reserves could prompt a goodwill impairment analysis of our International E&P segment before or after our annual test at April 1. Depreciation and depletion of crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil producing properties is determined by the units-of-production method and could change with revisions to estimated proved reserves. While revisions of previous reserve estimates have not been significant to the depreciation and depletion rate to any of our segments over the past three years, any reduction in proved reserves, especially as a result of lower commodity prices, could result in an acceleration of future DD&A expense. The following table illustrates, on average, the sensitivity of each segment's units-of-production DD&A per boe and pretax income to a hypothetical 10% change in 2015 proved reserves based on 2015 production. Impact of a Ten% Increase in Proved Reserves Impact of a Ten% Decrease in Proved Reserves (In millions, except per boe) DD&A per boe Pretax Income DD&A per boe Pretax Income North America E&P $ (2.20 ) $ 216 $ 2.69 $ (264 ) International E&P $ (0.63 ) $ 27 $ 0.77 $ (33 ) Oil Sands Mining $ (1.04 ) $ 17 $ 1.46 $ (24 ) Asset Retirement Obligations We have material legal, regulatory and contractual obligations to remove and dismantle long-lived assets and to restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations, including bitumen mining operations. A liability equal to the fair value of such obligations and a corresponding capitalized asset retirement cost are recognized on the balance sheet in the period in which the legal obligation is incurred and a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The capitalized asset retirement cost is depreciated using the units-of-production method and the discounted liability is accreted over the period until the obligation is satisfied, the impacts of which are recognized as DD&A in the consolidated statements of income. In many cases, the satisfaction and subsequent discharge of these liabilities is projected to occur many years, or even decades, into the future. Furthermore, the legal, regulatory and contractual requirements often do not provide specific guidance regarding removal practices and the criteria that must be fulfilled when the removal and/or restoration event actually occurs. Estimates of retirement costs are developed for each property based on numerous factors, such as the scope of the dismantlement, timing of settlement, interpretation of legal, regulatory and contractual requirements, type of production and processing structures, depth of water (if applicable), reservoir characteristics, depth of the reservoir, market demand for equipment, currently available dismantlement and restoration procedures and consultations with construction and engineering professionals. Inflation rates and credit-adjusted-risk-free interest rates are then applied to estimate the fair values of the obligations. To the extent these or other assumptions change after initial recognition of the liability, the fair value estimate is 56 revised and the recognized liability adjusted, with a corresponding adjustment made to the related asset balance or income statement, as appropriate. Changes in estimated asset retirement obligations for late life assets could result in future impairment charges. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures regarding our asset retirement obligation estimates. An estimate of the sensitivity to net income if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practical because of the number of obligations that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of possible assumptions. Fair Value Estimates Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. There are three approaches for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities: the market approach, the income approach and the cost approach, each of which includes multiple valuation techniques. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach uses valuation techniques to measure fair value by converting future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, into a single present value, or range of present values, using current market expectations about those future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace the service capacity of an asset. This is often referred to as current replacement cost. The cost approach assumes that the fair value would not exceed what it would cost a market participant to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility, adjusted for obsolescence. The fair value accounting standards do not prescribe which valuation technique should be used when measuring fair value and do not prioritize among the techniques. These standards establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in applying the various valuation techniques. Inputs broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make pricing decisions, including assumptions about risk. Level 1 inputs are given the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy while Level 3 inputs are given the lowest priority. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: Level 1 Observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets as of the measurement date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 2 Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. These are inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date. Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data and may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management best estimate of fair value. Valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs are favored. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest priority level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities within the levels of the fair value hierarchy. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures regarding our fair value measurements. Significant uses of fair value measurements include: impairment assessments of long-lived assets; impairment assessments of goodwill; and recorded value of derivative instruments. The need to test long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment can be based on several indicators, including a significant reduction in prices of crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas or synthetic crude oil, sustained declines in our common stock, reductions to our Capital Program, unfavorable adjustments to reserves, significant changes in the expected timing of production, other changes to contracts or changes in the regulatory environment in which the property is located. Impairment Assessments of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets in use are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. For purposes of an impairment evaluation, long-lived assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified, which generally is field-by-field for our North America E&P and International E&P assets and at the project level for OSM assets. If the sum of the undiscounted estimated cash flows from the use of the asset group and its eventual disposition is less than the carrying value of an asset group, the carrying value is written down to the estimated fair value. During 2015, we determined that the substantial decline in commodity prices and the resulting change in future commodity price assumptions was a triggering event which required us to 57 reassess long-lived assets related to oil and gas producing properties for impairment. We estimated the fair values using an income approach and recognized impairments during 2015. Commodity prices are one of the most significant inputs into our models. A further decline in our commodity price assumptions could result in additional future impairment charges. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 13 and Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of impairments recorded in 2015, 2014 and 2013 and the related fair value measurements. Fair value calculated for the purpose of testing our long-lived assets for impairment is estimated using the present value of expected future cash flows method and comparative market prices when appropriate. Significant judgment is involved in performing these fair value estimates since the results are based on forecasted assumptions. Significant assumptions include: Future crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil prices. Our estimates of future prices are based on our analysis of market supply and demand and consideration of market price indicators. Although these commodity prices may experience extreme volatility in any given year, we believe long-term industry prices are driven by global market supply and demand. To estimate supply, we consider numerous factors, including the worldwide resource base, depletion rates and OPEC production policies. We believe demand is largely driven by global economic factors, such as population and income growth, governmental policies and vehicle stocks. The prices we use in our fair value estimates are consistent with those used in our planning and capital investment reviews. There has been significant volatility in crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil prices and estimates of such future prices are inherently imprecise. Estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil. Such quantities are based on a combination of proved and risk-weighted probable reserves such that the combined volumes represent the most likely expectation of recovery. Expected timing of production. Production forecasts are the outcome of engineer studies which estimate reserves, as well as expected capital development programs. The actual timing of the production could be different than the projection. Cash flows realized later in the projection period are less valuable than those realized earlier due to the time value of money. The expected timing of production that we use in our fair value estimates is consistent with that used in our planning and capital investment reviews. Discount rate commensurate with the risks involved. We apply a discount rate to our expected cash flows based on a variety of factors, including market and economic conditions, operational risk, regulatory risk and political risk. A higher discount rate decreases the net present value of cash flows. Future capital requirements. Our estimates of future capital requirements are based upon a combination of authorized spending and internal forecasts. We base our fair value estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonable. However, actual results may differ from these projections. A further sustained decline in commodity prices may cause us to reassess our long-lived assets for impairment, and could result in future non-cash impairment charges as a result of such impairment assessments. An estimate of the sensitivity to net income resulting from impairment calculations is not practicable, given the numerous assumptions (e.g. reserves, pace and timing of development plans, commodity prices, capital expenditures, drilling and development costs and discount rates) that can materially affect our estimates. That is, unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions may be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions. Impairment Assessments of Goodwill Goodwill must be tested for impairment at least annually, or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. After we performed our annual impairment test in April 2015, there was a continued decline in commodity prices as discussed above. Downward revisions to forecasted commodity price assumptions and sustained price declines in our common stock were triggering events which required us to reassess our goodwill for impairment as of September 30 and December 31, 2015. Based on the results of these assessments, we fully impaired the goodwill associated with our N.A. E&P reporting unit. While the fair value of our International E&P reporting unit exceeded book value at December 31, 2015, subsequent commodity price and/or common stock price declines may cause us to reassess our goodwill for impairment and could result in a non-cash impairment charge in the future. We estimated the fair values of the North America E&P and International E&P reporting units using a combination of market and income approaches. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The market approach referenced observable inputs specific to us and our industry. The income approach calculated the present value of expected future cash flows, which were based on forecasted assumptions. Key assumptions to the income approach are the same as those described above regarding our impairment assessment of long-lived assets. We believe the estimates and assumptions used in our impairment assessments are reasonable and based on available market information, but variations in such assumptions could result in materially different calculations of fair value and 58 determinations of whether or not an impairment is indicated. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the goodwill impairment recorded in 2015. Derivatives We record all derivative instruments at fair value. Fair value measurements for all our derivative instruments are based on observable market-based inputs that are corroborated by market data and are discussed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. Additional information about derivatives and their valuation may be found in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in numerous taxing jurisdictions worldwide. Estimates of income taxes to be recorded involve interpretation of complex tax laws and assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our U.S. federal income taxes. We have recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between book basis and tax basis, tax credit carryforwards and operating loss carryforwards. We routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In assessing the need for additional or adjustments to existing valuation allowances, we consider the preponderance of evidence concerning the realization of the deferred tax asset. We must consider any prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that might minimize the amount of deferred tax liabilities recognized or the amount of any valuation allowance recognized against deferred tax assets, if we can implement the strategies and if we expect to implement them in the event the forecasted conditions actually occur. Assumptions related to the permanent reinvestment of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are reconsidered quarterly to give effect to changes in our portfolio of producing properties and in our tax profile. In the second quarter of 2015, we reviewed our operations and concluded that we do not have the same level of capital needs outside the U.S. as previously expected. Therefore, we no longer intend for previously unremitted foreign earnings of approximately $1 billion associated with our Canadian operations to be permanently reinvested outside the U.S. As such, none our foreign earnings remain permanently reinvested abroad. Our net deferred tax assets, after valuation allowances, are expected to be realized through our future taxable income and the reversal of temporary differences. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the estimation of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil prices) and the assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our U.S. federal income taxes. The estimates and assumptions used in determining future taxable income are consistent with those used in our planning and capital investment reviews. We consider a combination of reserve categories related to our existing producing properties, as well as estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil related to undeveloped discoveries if, in our judgment, it is likely that development plans will be approved in the foreseeable future. Assumptions regarding our ability to realize the U.S. federal benefit of foreign tax credits are based on certain estimates concerning future operating conditions (particularly crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil prices), future financial conditions, income generated from foreign sources and our tax profile in the year that such credits may be claimed. A sustained decline in commodity prices could cause us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and U.S. federal benefit of foreign tax credits. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations Accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the following: the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; the expected long-term return on plan assets; the rate of future increases in compensation levels; and health care cost projections. We develop our demographics and utilize the work of third-party actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations. We have selected different discount rates for our U.S. pension plans and our other U.S. postretirement benefit plans due to the different projected benefit payment patterns. In determining the assumed discount rates, our methods include a review of market yields on high-quality corporate debt and use of our third-party actuary's discount rate model. This model calculates an equivalent single discount rate for the projected benefit plan cash flows using a yield curve derived from bond yields. The yield curve represents a series of annualized individual spot discount rates from 0.5 to 99 years. The bonds used are rated AA or higher by a recognized rating agency, only non-callable bonds are included and outlier bonds (bonds that have a yield to maturity that significantly deviates from the average yield within each maturity grouping) are removed. Each issue is required to have at least $250 million par value outstanding. The constructed yield curve is based on those bonds representing the 50% highest yielding issuances within each defined maturity group. 59 Of the assumptions used to measure obligations and estimated annual net periodic benefit cost as of December 31, the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit cost reported for the plans. The hypothetical impacts of a 0.25% change in the discount rates of 4.04% for our U.S. pension plans and 4.36% for our other U.S. postretirement benefit plans is summarized in the table below: Impact of a 0.25% Increase in Discount Rate Impact of a 0.25% Decrease in Discount Rate (In millions) Obligation Expense Obligation Expense U.S. pension plans $ (14 ) $ (1 ) $ 14 $ 1 Other U.S. postretirement benefit plans $ (6 ) $ $ 7 $ The asset rate of return assumption for the funded U.S. plan considers the plan's asset mix (currently targeted at approximately 55% equity and 45% other fixed income securities), past performance and other factors. Certain components of the asset mix are modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation, debt returns and stock yields. Decreasing the 6.75% asset rate of return assumption by 0.25% would not have a significant impact on our defined benefit pension expense. Compensation change assumptions are based on historical experience, anticipated future management actions and demographics of the benefit plans. Health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements includes detailed information about the assumptions used to calculate the components of our annual defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan expense, as well as the obligations and accumulated other comprehensive income reported on the consolidated balance sheets. Contingent Liabilities We accrue contingent liabilities for environmental remediation, tax deficiencies related to operating taxes and litigation claims when such contingencies are probable and estimable. Actual costs can differ from estimates for many reasons. For instance, settlement costs for claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on responsibility and assessments of the amount of damages. Similarly, liabilities for environmental remediation may vary from estimates because of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation, additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination and improvements in technology. Our in-house legal counsel regularly assesses these contingent liabilities. In certain circumstances outside legal counsel is utilized. We generally record losses related to these types of contingencies as other operating expense or general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income, except for tax contingencies unrelated to income taxes, which are recorded as taxes other than income. For additional information on contingent liabilities, see Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Management Discussion and Analysis of Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies. An estimate of the sensitivity to net income if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practical because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, in terms of both the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss. Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
