Contents MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 1. Basis of Presentation These consolidated financial statements are unaudited; however, in the opinion of management, these statements reflect all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the periods reported. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature unless disclosed otherwise. These consolidated financial statements, including notes, have been prepared in accordance with the applicable rules of the SEC and do not include all of the information and disclosures required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The results of operations for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. 2. Accounting Standards Accounting Standards Updates Adopted No accounting standards were adopted in the third quarter of 2023 that had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Accounting Standards Updates Not Yet Adopted There were no issued but pending accounting standards expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 3. Income and Dividends per Common Share Basic income per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted income per share assumes exercise of stock options and performance units in all periods, provided the effect is not antidilutive. The per share calculations below exclude 1 million of antidilutive stock options and performance units for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, and 1 million and 2 million of antidilutive stock options and performance units for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively.

Revenues The majority of our revenues are derived from the sale of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas under spot and term agreements with our customers in the United States and Equatorial Guinea. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, receivables from contracts with customers, included in receivables, less reserves for credit losses, were $ 1.1 billion and $ 875 million, respectively. 7 Table of Contents MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) The following tables present our revenues from contracts with customers disaggregated by product type and geographic areas for the three and nine months ended September 30: United States Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 (In millions) Eagle Ford Bakken Oklahoma Permian Other U.S. Total Crude oil and condensate $ 587 $ 580 $ 64 $ 164 $ 13 $ 1,408 Natural gas liquids 80 47 30 20 177 Natural gas 48 20 31 12 1 112 Other 2 1 3 Revenues from contracts with customers $ 717 $ 647 $ 125 $ 196 $ 15 $ 1,700 Three Months Ended September 30, 2022 (In millions) Eagle Ford Bakken Oklahoma Permian Other U.S. Total Crude oil and condensate $ 523 $ 648 $ 104 $ 114 $ 39 $ 1,428 Natural gas liquids 49 82 63 16 6 216 Natural gas 56 67 105 22 11 261 Other 3 19 22 Revenues from contracts with customers $ 631 $ 797 $ 272 $ 152 $ 75 $ 1,927 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 (In millions) Eagle Ford Bakken Oklahoma Permian Other U.S. Total Crude oil and condensate $ 1,606 $ 1,467 $ 205 $ 475 $ 35 $ 3,788 Natural gas liquids 215 125 102 60 502 Natural gas 141 69 95 30 2 337 Other 5 11 16 Revenues from contracts with customers $ 1,967 $ 1,661 $ 402 $ 565 $ 48 $ 4,643 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 (In millions) Eagle Ford Bakken Oklahoma Permian Other U.S. Total Crude oil and condensate $ 1,526 $ 2,049 $ 341 $ 302 $ 124 $ 4,342 Natural gas liquids 148 263 191 46 23 671 Natural gas 145 156 256 55 28 640 Other 6 71 77 Revenues from contracts with customers $ 1,825 $ 2,468 $ 788 $ 403 $ 246 $ 5,730 8 Table of Contents MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) International (E.G.)

Segment Information We have two reportable operating segments. Both of these segments are organized and managed based upon geographic location and the nature of the products and services offered. United States ( U.S. ) explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas in the United States; and International ( Int l ) explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas outside of the United States as well as produces and markets products manufactured from natural gas, such as LNG and methanol, in Equatorial Guinea ( E.G. ) Segment income represents income that excludes certain items not allocated to our operating segments, net of income taxes. A portion of our corporate and operations general and administrative support costs are not allocated to the operating segments. These unallocated costs primarily consist of employment costs (including pension effects), professional services, facilities and other costs associated with corporate and operations support activities. Additionally, items which affect comparability such as: gains or losses on dispositions, impairments of proved and certain unproved properties, dry wells, changes in our valuation allowance, unrealized gains or losses on commodity and interest rate derivative instruments, effects of pension settlements and curtailments, expensed transaction costs for business combinations or other items (as determined by the chief operating decision maker ( CODM )) are not allocated to operating segments. 9 Table of Contents MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 (In millions) U.S. Int l Not Allocated to Segments Total Revenues from contracts with customers $ 1,700 $ 71 $ $ 1,771 Net gain (loss) on commodity derivatives 7 ( 6 ) (b) 1 Income from equity method investments 38 38 Net gain on disposal of assets 1 1 Other income 1 1 2 Less costs and expenses: Production 173 19 192 Shipping, handling and other operating 162 2 164 Exploration 8 1 11 (c) 20 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 570 12 1 583 Taxes other than income 112 1 113 General and administrative 32 3 37 72 Net interest and other 94 94 Other net periodic benefit costs ( 5 ) ( 5 ) Income tax provision (benefit) 145 11 ( 29 ) 127 Segment income (loss) $ 505 $ 62 $ ( 114 ) $ 453 Total assets $ 18,503 $ 1,072 $ 344 $ 19,919 Capital expenditures (a) $ 444 $ 1 $ 4 $ 449 (a) Includes accruals and excludes acquisitions.

Income Taxes Effective Tax Rate The effective income tax rate is influenced by a variety of factors including the geographic and functional sources of income and the relative magnitude of these sources of income. The difference between the total provision and the sum of the amounts allocated to segments is reported in the Not Allocated to Segments column of the tables in Note 5 . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, our effective income tax rates were as follows: Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Effective income tax rate 22 % 23 % 21 % % 2022 Our effective income tax rate was different from our U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, due to the first quarter 2022 release of the valuation allowance on certain U.S. and state deferred tax assets resulting in a non-cash deferred tax benefit of $ 685 million. In August 2022, the President signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 ( IRA ) into law. The IRA enacted various income tax provisions, including a 15% corporate book minimum tax. The corporate book minimum tax, which became effective on January 1, 2023, applies to corporations with an average annual adjusted financial statement income that exceeds $1 billion for the preceding three years. Under current law and guidance, we do not anticipate being subject to the corporate book minimum tax in 2023 but anticipate that the corporate book minimum tax will apply in 2024. The U.S. Treasury is expected to publish further guidance and regulations that will be relevant to scoping considerations and the calculation of minimum income tax liabilities. As this guidance is issued, we will continue to evaluate and assess the impact the IRA may have on our current and future period income taxes. We have made an accounting policy election to consider the effects of the corporate book minimum tax on the realizability of our deferred tax assets, carryforwards and tax credits as a period cost when they arise. 7. Credit Losses The majority of our receivables are from purchasers of commodities or joint interest owners in properties we operate, both of which are recorded at estimated or invoiced amounts and do not bear interest. The majority of these receivables have payment terms of 30 days or less. At the end of each reporting period, we assess the collectability of our receivables and estimate the expected credit losses using historical data, current market conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions and other data as deemed appropriate. Changes in the allowance for credit losses were as follows: (In millions) September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Beginning balance as of January 1 $ 10 $ 15 Current period provision 3 ( 3 ) Current period write offs ( 2 ) ( 2 ) Recoveries of amounts previously reserved ( 1 ) Ending balance $ 10 $ 10 14 Table of Contents MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 8. Inventories Crude oil and natural gas liquids are recorded at weighted average cost and carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Supplies and other items consist principally of tubular goods and equipment which are valued at weighted average cost and reviewed periodically for obsolescence or impairment when market conditions indicate. (In millions) September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Crude oil and natural gas liquids $ 9 $ 15 Supplies and other items 165 110 Inventories $ 174 $ 125 9. Property, Plant and Equipment (In millions) September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 United States $ 17,098 $ 17,034 International 260 288 Corporate 53 55 Net property, plant and equipment $ 17,411 $ 17,377 As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had $ 10 million and $ 20 million, respectively, of exploratory well costs capitalized greater than one year related to suspended wells. Management believes these wells exhibit sufficient quantities of hydrocarbons to justify potential development. All of the suspended wells require completion activities in order to classify the reserves as proved. The decrease during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included a reduction in suspended well costs as we recorded $ 10 million of d ry well expense associated with drilled and uncompleted exploratory wells in Permian. 10.

We primarily act as a lessee in these transactions and the majority of our existing leases are classified as either short-term or long-term operating leases. Finance Leases In 2018, we signed an agreement with an owner/lessor to construct and lease a new build-to-suit office building in Houston, Texas. The initial lease term is five years and commenced in late September 2021 after the new Houston office was ready for occupancy. In March 2022, we made our first cash lease payment. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, we have made cash lease payments totaling approximately $ 16 million and $ 6 million, respectively. At the end of the initial lease term, we can negotiate to extend the lease term for an additional five years , subject to the approval of the participants; purchase the property subject to certain terms and conditions; or remarket the property to an unrelated third party. The lease contains a residual value guarantee of 100 % of the total acquisition and construction costs. Lessor Our wholly owned subsidiary, Marathon E.G. Production Limited, is a lessor for residential housing in E.G., which is occupied by EGHoldings, a related party equity method investee see Note 20 . The lease was classified as an operating lease and expires in 2024, with a lessee option to extend through 2034. Lease payments are fixed for the entire duration of the agreement at approximately $ 6 million per year. Our lease income is reported in other income in our consolidated statements of income for all periods presented. The undiscounted cash flows to be received under this lease agreement are summarized below.

Derivatives We may use derivatives to manage a portion of our exposure to commodity price risk, commodity locational risk and interest rate risk. For further information regarding the fair value measurement of derivative instruments, see Note 13 . All of our commodity derivatives and interest rate derivatives are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements under which we report net amounts. The following tables present the gross fair values of our open derivative instruments and the reported net amounts along with their locations in our consolidated balance sheets.

These derivatives are three-way collars. Three-way collars consist of a sold call (ceiling), a purchased put (floor) and a sold put. The ceiling price is the maximum we will receive for the contract volumes; the floor is the minimum price we will receive, unless the market price falls below the sold put strike price. In this case, we receive the NYMEX WTI price or the Henry Hub price plus the difference between the floor and the sold put price. These crude oil and natural gas derivatives were not designated as hedges. 17 Table of Contents MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) The following table sets forth outstanding derivative contracts as of September 30, 2023, and the weighted average prices for those contracts: 2023 2024 Fourth Quarter First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Crude Oil NYMEX WTI Three-Way Collars Volume (Bbls/day) 10,000 20,000 20,000 Weighted average price per Bbl: Ceiling $ 97.59 $ 100.06 $ 100.06 $ $ Floor $ 60.00 $ 67.50 $ 67.50 $ $ Sold put $ 45.00 $ 52.50 $ 52.50 $ $ Natural Gas Henry Hub Three-Way Collars Volume (MMBtu/day) 50,000 $ Weighted average price per MMBtu: Ceiling $ 11.14 $ $ $ $ Floor $ 4.00 $ $ $ $ Sold Put $ 2.50 $ $ $ $ The following table sets forth outstanding derivative contracts as of October 31, 2023, with their weighted average prices, and is inclusive of activities that occurred subsequent to September 30, 2023: 2023 2024 Fourth Quarter First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Crude Oil NYMEX WTI Three-Way Collars Volume (Bbls/day) 10,000 40,000 40,000 20,000 20,000 Weighted average price per Bbl: Ceiling $ 97.59 $ 101.01 $ 101.01 $ 101.95 $ 101.95 Floor $ 60.00 $ 66.25 $ 66.25 $ 65.00 $ 65.00 Sold put $ 45.00 $ 51.25 $ 51.25 $ 50.00 $ 50.00 Natural Gas Henry Hub Three-Way Collars Volume (MMBtu/day) 50,000 $ Weighted average price per MMBtu: Ceiling $ 11.14 $ $ $ $ Floor $ 4.00 $ $ $ $ Sold Put $ 2.50 $ $ $ $ 18 Table of Contents MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) The unrealized and realized gain (loss) impact of our commodity derivative instruments appears in the table below and is reflected in net gain (loss) on commodity derivatives in the consolidated statements of income.

During the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, net cash paid for settled derivative positions was $ 56 million and $ 145 million, respectively. Interest Rate Swaps During 2020, we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $ 350 million to hedge variations in cash flows arising from fluctuations in the LIBOR benchmark interest rate related to forecasted interest payments of a future debt issuance in 2025. The expected proceeds of the future debt issuance were intended to refinance our $ 900 million 3.85 % Senior Notes due 2025 ( 2025 Notes ). In September 2021, we fully redeemed these 2025 Notes. In March 2022, we closed these positions and settled the interest rate swaps for proceeds of $ 44 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we recorded a cumulative $ 17 million gain within net interest and other within our consolidated statements of income related to these swaps. Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow Hedges During 2019, we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with a maturity date of September 9, 2026 to hedge variations in cash flows related to the interest rate component of future lease payments of our Houston office. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the notional amount of open interest rate swaps for the Houston office was $ 295 million. The weighted average secured overnight financing rate ( SOFR ) for the swaps was 1.43 % as of both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The Houston office lease commenced in September 2021, however, our first cash lease payment for February 2022 rent was paid in March 2022. The first settlement date for the interest rate swaps was in January 2022. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash received for the settled interest rate swap positions was $ 8 million. As of September 30, 2023, we expect to reclassify a $ 11 million gain from accumulated other comprehensive income into our consolidated statements of income over the next twelve months. See Note 1 1 for further details regarding Houston office lease. 13. Fair Value Measurements Fair Values Recurring The following tables present assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 by hierarchy level. September 30, 2023 (In millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Derivative instruments, assets Commodity (a) $ $ 3 $ $ 3 Interest rate - designated as cash flow hedges 25 25 Derivative instruments, assets $ $ 28 $ $ 28 19 Table of Contents MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) December 31, 2022 (In millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Derivative instruments, assets Commodity (a) $ $ 10 $ $ 10 Interest rate - designated as cash flow hedges 24 24 Derivative instruments, assets $ $ 34 $ $ 34 (a) Commodity derivative instruments are recorded on a net basis in our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 12 . As of September 30, 2023, our commodity derivatives include three-way collars. These instruments are measured at fair value using either a Black-Scholes or a modified Black-Scholes Model. For three-way collars, inputs to the models include commodity prices and implied volatility and are categorized as Level 2 because predominantly all assumptions and inputs are observable in active markets throughout the term of the instruments. The forward starting interest rate swaps are measured at fair value with a market approach using actionable broker quotes, which are Level 2 inputs. See Note 12 for details on the forward starting interest rate swaps. Fair Values Financial Instruments Our current assets and liabilities include financial instruments, the most significant of which are receivables, commercial paper borrowings, the current portion of our long-term debt and payables. We believe the carrying values of our receivables, commercial paper borrowings and payables approximate fair value. Our fair value assessment incorporates a variety of considerations, including (1) the short-term duration of the instruments, (2) our credit rating and (3) our historical incurrence of and expected future insignificant bad debt expense, which includes an evaluation of counterparty credit risk. The following table summarizes financial instruments, excluding receivables, commercial paper borrowings, payables and derivative financial instruments, and their reported fair values by individual balance sheet line item at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 (In millions) Fair Value Carrying Amount Fair Value Carrying Amount Financial assets Other noncurrent assets $ 9 $ 27 $ 10 $ 28 Total financial assets $ 9 $ 27 $ 10 $ 28 Financial liabilities Other current liabilities $ 132 $ 198 $ 140 $ 204 Long-term debt, including current portion (a) 5,126 5,297 5,806 5,948 Deferred credits and other liabilities 45 45 73 73 Total financial liabilities $ 5,303 $ 5,540 $ 6,019 $ 6,225 (a) Excludes debt issuance costs. Fair values of our financial assets included in other noncurrent assets, and of our financial liabilities included in other current liabilities and deferred credits and other liabilities, are measured using an income approach and most inputs are internally generated, which results in a Level 3 classification. Estimated future cash flows are discounted using a rate deemed appropriate to obtain the fair value. Our fixed rate debt instruments are publicly traded. The fair value of our fixed rate debt is measured using a market approach, based upon quotes from major financial institutions, which are Level 2 inputs. Our floating rate debt is non-public and consists of borrowings under our Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility. The fair value of our floating rate debt approximates the carrying value and is estimated based on observable market-based inputs, which results in a Level 2 classification. 20 Table of Contents MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 14. Debt Term Loan Facility In November 2022, we entered into a term credit agreement, which provides for a two-year $ 1.5 billion term loan facility ( Term Loan Facility ) and we borrowed the full amount thereunder in December 2022. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility can be prepaid without penalty. As of September 30, 2023, we had $ 1.5 billion in borrowings under our Term Loan Facility. The third quarter weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the Term Loan Facility was 7.10 % . The Term Loan Facility includes a covenant requiring our total debt to total capitalization ratio not to exceed 65 % as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. In the event of a default, the lenders holding more than half of the commitments may terminate all of the commitments under the Term Loan Facility and require the immediate repayment of all outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan Facility. As of September 30, 2023, we were in compliance with this covenant with a ratio of 26 %. Subsequent to the quarter, we repaid $ 250 million of outstanding borrowings on October 31, 2023. We have $ 1.3 billion in borrowings remaining under our Term Loan Facility. Revolving Credit Facility In September 2023, we increased our $ 2.5 billion unsecured Revolving Credit Facility by $ 61 million to a total of $ 2.6 billion. Fees on the unused commitment of each lender, as well as the borrowing options under the Revolving Credit Facility, remain unaffected by the increase. We have the option to increase the commitment amount by up to an additional $ 939 million, subject to the consent of any increasing lenders. The Revolving Credit Facility maturity remains July 28, 2027. During the third quarter of 2023, we utilized commercial paper borrowings to fully repay our outstanding borrowings against our $ 2.6 billion unsecured Revolving Credit Facility. The third quarter weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility was 6.82 % . The Revolving Credit Facility includes a covenant requiring our total debt to total capitalization ratio not to exceed 65 % as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. In the event of a default, the lenders holding more than half of the commitments may terminate the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility and require the immediate repayment of all outstanding borrowings and the cash collateralization of all outstanding letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2023, we were in compliance with this covenant with a ratio of 26 %. Commercial Paper Program During the second quarter of 2023, we obtained ratings for our commercial paper from Moody s, Standard & Poor and Fitch. Pursuant to our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured notes in a maximum aggregate face amount of $ 2.5 billion outstanding at any time, with maturities up to 365 days from the date of issuance. Our $ 2.5 billion commercial paper program is backed by our $ 2.6 billion Revolving Credit Facility. During the third quarter of 2023, we utilized our recently established commercial paper program to fund various short-term working capital requirements. As of September 30, 2023, we had $ 450 million of outstanding commercial paper maturing at various dates. The third quarter weighted average interest rate for commercial paper borrowings was 6.19 %. Debt Redemption On July 17, 2023, we repaid the $ 131 million 8.125 % Senior Notes in connection with their maturity date. On March 1, 2023, we repaid the $ 70 million 8.5 % Senior Notes in connection with their maturity date. Long-term debt At September 30, 2023, we had $ 5.3 billion of total long-term debt outstanding. Long-term debt due within one year consists of $ 200 million 2.1 % Bonds and $ 200 million 2.125 % Bonds which feature a mandatory put on July 1, 2024. Refer to our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a listing of our long-term debt maturities. Debt Remarketing On April 3, 2023, we closed a $ 200 million remarketing to investors of sub-series 2017A-1 bonds that are part of the $ 1 billion St. John the Baptist Parish, State of Louisiana revenue refunding bonds Series 2017. The bonds are subject to an interest rate of 4.05 % and a mandatory purchase date of July 1, 2026. The repayments and new borrowings associated with the remarketed bonds are presented separately within Debt repayments and Borrowings, respectively, within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 21 Table of Contents MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 15. Stockholders Equity Our Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program. During the first nine months of 2023, we repurchased approximately 45 million shares of our common stock pursuant to the share repurchase program at a cost of $ 1.1 billion. Our remaining share repurchase authorization was approximately $ 1.4 billion at September 30, 2023. Purchases under the program are made at our discretion and may be in either open market transactions, including block purchases, or in privately negotiated transactions using cash on hand, cash generated from operations or proceeds from potential asset sales. This program may be changed based upon our financial condition or changes in market conditions and is subject to termination prior to completion. Additionally, during the first nine months of 2023 we repurchased $ 31 million of shares related to our tax withholding obligation associated with the vesting of stock-based compensation awards; these repurchases do not impact our share repurchase program authorization. Subsequent to the quarter, we repurchased approximately $ 145 million of shares of our common stock through November 1, 2023. Effective November 1, 2023, our Board of Directors increased our remaining share repurchase program authorization to $ 2.5 billion. 16.

At September 30, 2023, there were 686,266 outstanding stock-based performance units to be settled in shares to officers. During the first nine months of 2023, we also granted 222,464 stock-based performance units to eligible officers, which are settled in cash. At the grant date for these performance units, each unit represents the value of one share of our common stock. The fair value of each cash-settled performance unit was $ 27.05 as of September 30, 2023. During the first nine months of 2023, we also cash settled the units related to the 2021 grant.

Commitments and Contingencies Various groups, including the State of North Dakota and the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation or MHA Nation, also known as the Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation (the Three Affiliated Tribes ) represented by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (the BIA ), have been involved in a dispute regarding the ownership of certain lands underlying the Missouri River and Little Missouri River (the Disputed Land ) from which we currently produce. As a result, as of September 30, 2023, we have a $ 168 million current liability in suspended royalty and working interest revenue, including interest, of which $ 144 million was included within accounts payable and $ 24 million related to accrued interest was included within other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, we have a long-term receivable of $ 26 million for capital and expenses. To address a potential dispute with the Three Affiliated Tribes over the validity of certain of our leases, Marathon Oil has entered into an agreement pursuant to which we will pay an amount representing $ 50 million of the suspended royalties (inclusive of interest thereon) to the Three Affiliated Tribes. The agreement allows Marathon to recover all funds paid to the Three Affiliated Tribes (including by offsetting against production from other minerals leased to Marathon by the Three Affiliated Tribes) if a court ultimately determines that the Disputed Land is not held in trust for the Three Affiliated Tribes, but instead is owned by the State of North Dakota. The United States Department of the Interior ( DOI ) has addressed the United States position with respect to this dispute several times in recent years with conflicting opinions. In January 2017, the DOI issued an opinion that the Disputed Land is held in trust for the Three Affiliated Tribes, then in June 2018 and May 2020 the DOI issued opinions concluding that the State of North Dakota held title to the Disputed Land. Most recently, on February 4, 2022, the DOI issued an opinion ( 2022 M-Opinion ) concluding that the Disputed Land is held in trust for the Three Affiliated Tribes. While the 2022 M-Opinion is binding on all agencies within the DOI, it is not legally binding on third parties, including Marathon Oil, the State of North Dakota, or a court. Given the uncertainty in matters such as these, we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of this matter at this time; however, we believe the resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are a defendant in a number of legal and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business including, but not limited to, royalty claims, contract claims, tax disputes and environmental claims. While the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, we may also be subject to retained liabilities with respect to certain divested assets by operation of law. For example, we are exposed to the risk that owners and/or operators of assets purchased from us become unable to satisfy plugging or abandonment obligations that attach to those assets. In that event, due to operation of law, we may be required to assume plugging or abandonment obligations for those assets. Although we have established reserves for such liabilities, we could be required to accrue additional amounts in the future and these amounts could be material. Marathon Oil was named in a lawsuit alleging improper royalty deductions in certain of our Oklahoma operations, and after plaintiffs lost their attempt to certify a class action, a settlement was reached, and in the first quarter of 2023 such settlement was approved by the court and paid. We have received Notice of Violations ( NOV ) from the EPA related to allegations of violations of the Clean Air Act with respect to our operations on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation between 2015 and 2019. We continue to actively negotiate a draft consent decree with the EPA and Department of Justice. The resolution of the enforcement action will likely include monetary sanctions and implementation of both environmental mitigation projects and injunctive terms, which would increase both our development costs and operating costs. We maintain an accrual for estimated potential monetary sanctions. Through the date of this filing, there exists substantial uncertainty as to the ultimate result of this matter and it is reasonably possible the result could be materially different from our expectations and our accrual. The Company received NOV from the EPA relating to alleged Clean Air Act violations following flyovers conducted in 2020 and 2022 over certain of the Company oil and gas facilities in New Mexico. The notices involve alleged emission and permitting violations. We initiated discussions with the EPA to resolve these matters. At this time, we are unable to estimate the potential loss associated with these matters, however, it is reasonably possible that resolution of these matters may result in a fine or penalty in ex cess of $ 300,000 . 25 Table of Contents MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) We have incurred and will continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately offset by the prices we receive for our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes. These laws generally provide for control of pollutants released into the environment and require responsible parties to undertake remediation of hazardous waste disposal sites. Penalties may be imposed for noncompliance. At September 30, 2023, accrued liabilities for remediation relating to environmental laws and regulations were not material. It is not presently possible to estimate the ultimate amount of all remediation cost that might be incurred or the penalties that may be imposed. In the second quarter of 2019, Marathon E.G. Production Limited ( MEGPL ), a consolidated and wholly owned subsidiary, signed a series of agreements to process third-party Alen Unit gas through existing infrastructure located in Punta Europa, E.G. Our equity method investee, Alba Plant LLC, is also a party to some of the agreements. These agreements require (subject to certain limitations) MEGPL to indemnify the owners of the Alen Unit against injury to Alba Plant LLC personnel and damage to or loss of Alba Plant LLC automobiles, as well as third party claims caused by Alba Plant LLC and certain environmental liabilities arising from certain hydrocarbons in the custody of Alba Plant LLC. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate this obligation as we do not have any history of prior indemnification claims or environmental discharge or contamination. Therefore, we have not recorded a liability with respect to these indemnities since the amount of potential future payments under these indemnification clauses is not determinable. The agreements to process the third-party Alen Unit gas required the execution of third-party guarantees by Marathon Oil Corporation in favor of the Alen Unit owners. Two separate guarantees were executed during the second quarter of 2020; one for a maximum of approximately $ 91 million pertaining to the payment obligations of Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A. and another for a maximum of $ 25 million pertaining to the payment obligations of Alba Plant LLC. Payment by us would be required if any of those entities fails to honor its payment obligations pursuant to the relevant agreements with the owners of the Alen Unit. Certain owners of the Alen Unit, or their affiliates, are also direct or indirect shareholders in Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A. and Alba Plant LLC. Each guarantee expires no later than December 31, 2027. We measured these guarantees at fair value using the net present value of premium payments we expect to receive from our investees. Our liability for these guarantees was approximately $ 4 million as of September 30, 2023. Each of Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A. and Equatorial Guinea LNG Train 1, S.A. provided us with a pledge of its receivables as recourse against any payments we may make under the guaranty of Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A. performance. 26 Table of Contents Item 2. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Overview Outlook Operations Market Conditions Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates Cash Flows Liquidity and Capital Resources Environmental Matters and Other Contingencies The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the preceding consolidated financial statements and notes in Item 1 . Executive Overview We are an independent exploration and production company, focused on U.S. resource plays: Eagle Ford in Texas, Bakken in North Dakota, STACK and SCOOP in Oklahoma and Permian in New Mexico and Texas. Our U.S. assets are complemented by our international operations in E.G. Our overall business strategy is to responsibly deliver competitive corporate return levels, free cash flow and cash returns to shareholders, all of which are sustainable and resilient through long-term commodity price cycles. We expect to achieve our business strategy by adherence to a disciplined reinvestment rate capital allocation framework that limits our capital expenditures relative to our expected cash flow from operations. Keeping our workforce safe, maintaining a strong balance sheet, responsibly meeting global energy demand with a focus on continuously improving environmental performance, serving as a trusted partner in our local communities and maintaining best in-class corporate governance standards are foundational to the execution of our strategy. In December 2022, we closed on a transaction to acquire approximately 130,000 net proved and unproved acres, with an average 97% working interest, in the Eagle Ford resource play from Ensign Natural Resources ( Ensign ) for cash consideration of $3.0 billion. Below are certain key financial and operational highlights for the quarter: Financial and operational results Our net income was $453 million in the third quarter of 2023 as compared to net income of $817 million in the same period last year. Included in our financial results for the current quarter: Revenues from contracts with customers decreased $237 million compared to the same quarter last year as a result of lower realized commodity prices, partially offset by increased sales. Lower realized commodity prices also resulted in lower income from equity method investments, which decreased $152 million compared to the same quarter last year. Net sales volumes in the U.S. segment increased 25% compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by increased production from the acreage acquired from Ensign. The increase in net sales volumes resulted in higher depreciation, depletion and amortization expense of $123 million as compared to the same quarter last year. Our provision for income taxes decreased $113 million compared to the same quarter last year. Upon conclusion of the third quarter, we announced the signing of a 5-year firm LNG sales agreement for a portion of our equity gas from the Alba Field liquefied at EG LNG. The contract is effective January 1, 2024, and features a pricing structure linked to the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) index, providing us with significant incremental exposure to the European LNG market. 27 Table of Contents Prioritized return of capital to investors and maintained investment grade balance sheet In the first nine months of 2023, we repurchased $1.1 billion of shares through our share repurchase program. In addition, effective November 1, 2023, our Board increased our remaining share repurchase authorization to $2.5 billion. As of September 30, 2023, we have $174 million of cash on hand and $2.3 billion of total liquidity. We reduced our long-term debt, including the repayment at maturity of $70 million 8.5% Senior Notes on March 1, 2023 and $131 million 8.125% Senior Notes on July 17, 2023. In addition, subsequent to the quarter, we repaid $250 million of outstanding borrowings on our Term Loan Facility on October 31, 2023. During the first nine months of 2023, we paid $186 million of dividends, or $0.30 per share, compared to dividends paid of $0.23 per share during the first nine months of 2022. On October 25, 2023, our Board approved a 10% increase to our dividend payable to shareholders in the fourth quarter of 2023, to $0.11 per share. All three primary credit rating agencies continue to rate us as investment grade. Outlook Capital Budget In February 2023, we announced a 2023 capital budget of $1.9 billion to $2.0 billion that prioritizes free cash flow generation over production growth, consistent with our disciplined capital allocation framework. Our expectation is our full year capital expenditures will be at the higher end of our range. Our production targets for 2023 include full year oil-equivalent production of 385 - 405 mboed, of which we are also trending towards the higher end of the range. We continue to monitor inflationary pressures given the labor market, commodity prices, supply chain challenges and geopolitical instability. Operations The following table presents a summary of our sales volumes for each of our segments. Refer to Results of Operations for a price-volume analysis for each of the segments.

C ommodity prices experienced significant volatility in 2022 and this has continued into the third quarter of 2023. Russia invasion of Ukraine was a geopolitical shock that caused energy prices to spike significantly higher in early to mid-2022. However, Russian oil production has remained at higher levels than expected, European gas shortages were averted as record levels of LNG were imported into that market and an exceptionally warm 2022 / 2023 winter in both the U.S. and Europe has refilled gas inventories to multi year highs causing prices to fall back significantly. Recent events in the Middle East have added a further geopolitical risk premium to oil prices and the outlook for that region remains extremely uncertain. Economic headwinds, caused by elevated interest rates as central banks fight inflation, continue to be a threat to energy demand growth as we move forward. P rice volatility was also exacerbated by ongoing OPEC+ petroleum supply limitations and economic sanctions involving producer countries. We continue to expect commodity price volatility given the complex global dynamics of supply and demand that exist in the market . Ref e r to Ite m 1A. Risk Factors in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion on how volatility in commodity prices could impact us. United States The following table presents our average price realizations and the related benchmarks for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 and 2022.

Crude oil and condensate Alba field liquids production is primarily condensate. We generally sell our share of condensate in relation to the Brent crude benchmark. Alba Plant LLC processes the rich hydrocarbon gas which is supplied by the Alba field under a fixed-price long-term contract. Alba Plant LLC extracts NGLs and condensate which is then sold by Alba Plant LLC at market prices, with our share of the revenue reflected in income from equity method investments on the consolidated statements of income. Alba Plant LLC delivers the processed dry natural gas to the Alba Unit Parties for distribution and sale to AMPCO and EG LNG. Natural gas liquids Wet gas is sold to Alba Plant LLC at a fixed-price long-term contract resulting in realized prices not tracking market price. Alba Plant LLC extracts and keeps NGLs, which are sold at market price, with our share of income from Alba Plant LLC being reflected in the income from equity method investments on the consolidated statements of income. Natural gas Dry natural gas, processed by Alba Plant LLC on behalf of the Alba Unit Parties, is sold by the Alba field to EG LNG and AMPCO at fixed-price contracts resulting in realized prices not tracking market price. The gas sales contracts between Alba Unit and EG LNG and AMPCO expire on December 31, 2023 and in 2026, respectively. We derive additional value from the equity investment in our downstream gas processing units EG LNG and AMPCO. EG LNG sells LNG on a market-based contract and AMPCO markets methanol at market prices. In March 2023, we announced the signing of a HOA to progress the development of the Equatorial Guinea Regional Gas Mega Hub. In October 2023, we announced the signing of a 5-year firm LNG sales agreement for a portion of our Alba gas liquefied at EG LNG. The contract is effective January 1, 2024, and features a pricing structure linked to the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) index, providing us with significant incremental exposure to the European LNG market. In addition to processing Alba Unit gas, Alba Plant LLC and EG LNG process third-party gas from the Alen field under a combination of a tolling and a market linked profit-sharing arrangement, the benefits of which are included in our respective share of income from equity method investees. This profit-sharing arrangement provides exposure to global LNG market prices. 31 Table of Contents Results of Operations Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 vs. Three Months Ended September 30, 2022 Revenues from contracts with customers are presented by segment in the table below: Three Months Ended September 30, (In millions) 2023 2022 Revenues from contracts with customers United States $ 1,700 $ 1,927 International 71 81 Segment revenues from contracts with customers $ 1,771 $ 2,008 Below is a price/volume analysis for each segment.

Net gain on commodity derivatives in the third quarter of 2023 was $1 million, compared to a net gain of $41 million for the same period in 2022. We have commodity derivative contracts which settle against the NYMEX WTI and Henry Hub indexes. We record commodity derivative gains/losses as the index pricing and forward curves change each period. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Income from equity method investments decreased $152 million in the third quarter of 2023, when compared to the third quarter of 2022, primarily due to lower prices realized by our equity method investees during the third quarter of 2023. Production expenses for the third quarter of 2023 decreased by $1 million compared to the same period in 2022. In the Eagle Ford, production expenses increased when compared to the prior year as a result of our acquisition of the Eagle Ford assets of Ensign in December 2022 and inflationary pressures. However, this increase was offset by decreased expenses in other areas as a result of less workover activity and expense projects when compared to the same period in 2022. The following table provides production expense and production expense rates for each segment: Three Months Ended September 30, ($ in millions; rate in $ per boe) 2023 2022 Increase (Decrease) 2023 2022 Increase (Decrease) Production Expense and Rate Expense Rate United States $ 173 $ 173 % $ 5.07 $ 6.40 (21) % International $ 19 $ 20 (5) % $ 3.99 $ 3.55 12 % 32 Table of Contents Shipping, handling and other operating expenses decreased $35 million in the third quarter of 2023 when compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to lower legal costs and a decrease in purchases of commodity volumes for resale to satisfy transportation commitments as compared to the prior period, partially offset by an increase in shipping and handling costs due to increased volumes from our acquisition of the Eagle Ford assets of Ensign in December 2022. Exploration expenses include unproved property impairments, dry well costs, geological and geophysical and other costs. The decrease in exploration expenses was primarily driven by lower impairments of unproved property leases and lower dry well costs in the third quarter of 2023 when compared the same period of 2022, primarily due to dry well costs and unproved property impairments in Louisiana Austin Chalk in the third quarter of 2022. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.

Taxes other than income decreased $24 million in the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to lower sales revenue in the third quarter of 2023, when compared to the same period in 2022. Net interest and other increased $42 million in the third quarter of 2023 primarily as a result of increased interest expense associated with borrowings on our Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility. Provision for income taxes decreased $113 million in the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to a decrease in income before income taxes for the current quarter when compared to the same period in 2022. 33 Table of Contents Segment Income Segment income represents income that excludes certain items not allocated to our operating segments, net of income taxes. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding items not allocated to the operating segments.

The decrease in segment income is a result of the variances described above. International segment income in the third quarter of 2023 was $62 million of income versus $181 million of income for the same period in 2022. The decrease was primarily due to lower prices realized by our equity method investees. Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes in the third quarter of 2023 was a loss of $114 million versus a loss of $87 million for the same period in 2022. The increase in loss was primarily due to unrealized net losses on commodity derivatives in the third quarter of 2023 versus unrealized net gains on commodity derivatives in the same period of 2022, partially offset by lower exploration expenses in 2023, as well as higher interest expense as a result of outstanding borrowings on our Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility.

The provision for income taxes in the first nine months of 2022 included a non-cash tax benefit of $685 million arising from the partial release of a valuation allowance on certain U.S. and state deferred tax assets, which was fully offset by the provision related to income earned by our operations in the first nine months of 2022. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Segment Income Segment income represents income that excludes certain items not allocated to our operating segments, net of income taxes. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding items not allocated to the operating segments. The following table reconciles segment income to net income: Nine Months Ended September 30, (In millions) 2023 2022 United States $ 1,295 $ 2,230 International 181 456 Segment income 1,476 2,686 Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes (319) 401 Net income $ 1,157 $ 3,087 United States segment income for the first nine months of 2023 was $1.3 billion of income versus $2.2 billion of income for the same period in 2022. The decrease in segment income is a result of the variances described above. 36 Table of Contents International segment income for the first nine months of 2023 was $181 million of income versus $456 million of income for the same period in 2022. The decrease was primarily due to lower prices realized by our equity method investees. Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes for the first nine months of 2023 was a loss of $319 million versus $401 million of income for the same period in 2022. The change from income to loss was primarily due to the partial release of a valuation allowance on certain U.S. and state deferred tax assets in the first six months of 2022, which resulted in a non-cash deferred tax benefit of $685 million. In addition, in first nine months of 2023, our interest expense increased as a result of outstanding borrowings on our Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility. Critical Accounting Estimates There have been no material changes or developments in the evaluation of the accounting estimates and the underlying assumptions or methodologies pertaining to our Critical Accounting Estimates disclosed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Cash Flows The following table presents sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents: Nine Months Ended September 30, (In millions) 2023 2022 Sources of cash and cash equivalents Net cash provided by operating activities $ 3,007 $ 4,301 Proceeds from revolving credit facility 1,018 Proceeds from commercial paper borrowings, net 450 Borrowings (a) 200 Equity method investments - return of capital 57 12 Other 23 Total sources of cash and cash equivalents $ 4,732 $ 4,336 Uses of cash and cash equivalents Additions to property, plant and equipment $ (1,659) $ (1,117) Repayments of revolving credit facility (1,468) Shares repurchased under buyback programs (1,121) (2,474) Debt repayments (a) (401) (35) Dividends paid (186) (162) Purchases of shares for tax withholding obligations (31) (21) Acquisitions, net of cash acquired (15) 2 Other (11) Total uses of cash and cash equivalents $ (4,892) $ (3,807) (a) Includes repayment and new borrowing associated with April 2023 remarketing to investors of $200 million sub-series 2017A-1 bonds. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Sources of cash and cash equivalents Cash flows generated from operating activities during the third quarter of 2023 were 30% lower compared to 2022, primarily as a result of lower realized commodity prices, partially offset by higher volumes resulting from our acquisition of the Eagle Ford assets of Ensign in December 2022. During the first nine months of 2023, we borrowed $1.0 billion and repaid $1.5 billion under our Revolving Credit Facility. Additionally, we have net outstanding commercial paper borrowings of $450 million a s of September 30, 2023. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below for further information. 37 Table of Contents Uses of cash and cash equivalents During the first nine months of 2023, we repurchased approximately 45 million shares of our common stock pursuant to the share repurchase program at a cost of $1.1 billion, paid dividends of $186 million and repaid the $70 million 8.5% Senior Notes and $131 million 8.125% Senior Notes. Additionally, we repurchased $31 million of shares during the first nine months of 2023 related to our tax withholding obligations associated with the vesting of stock-based compensation awards; these repurchases do not impact our share repurchase program authorization. During the third quarter of 2023, we utilized commercial paper borrowings to fully repay our $450 million outstanding borrowings against our $2.6 billion unsecured Revolving Credit Facility. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. The following table shows capital expenditures by segment and reconciles to additions to property, plant and equipment as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows: Nine Months Ended September 30, (In millions) 2023 2022 United States $ 1,661 $ 1,124 International 3 1 Not Allocated to Segments (Corporate) 9 11 Total capital expenditures (accrued) 1,673 1,136 Change in capital expenditure accrual (14) (19) Total use of cash and cash equivalents for property, plant and equipment $ 1,659 $ 1,117 The increase in our capital expenditures for the U.S. segment in the first nine months of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was largely driven by increased investment and drilling related to the Eagle Ford acreage we acquired from Ensign in December 2022. Additionally, inflationary pressures related to oil field services, labor, drilling materials and equipment in the first nine months of 2023, compared to the same period in 2022, contributed to the increase in capital expenditures. Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources and Available Liquidity Our main sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, internally generated cash flow from operations, capital market transactions and our Revolving Credit Facility. During the second quarter of 2023, we obtained ratings for our commercial paper from Moody s, Standard & Poor and Fitch. Pursuant to our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured notes in a maximum aggregate face amount of $2.5 billion outstanding at any time, with maturities up to 365 days from the date of issuance. Our $2.5 billion commercial paper program is backed by our $2.6 billion Revolving Credit Facility. At September 30, 2023, we had approximately $2.3 billion of liquidity consisting of $174 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2.1 billion available under our Revolving Credit Facility. Our working capital requirements are supported by our cash and cash equivalents, commercial paper program and our Revolving Credit Facility. We may issue commercial paper, draw on our Revolving Credit Facility to meet short-term cash requirements or issue debt or equity securities through the shelf registration statement discussed below as part of our longer-term liquidity and capital management program. Because of the alternatives available to us as discussed above, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity are adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements including our capital spending programs, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities, dividends and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies. See Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of how our commitments and contingencies could affect our available liquidity. General economic conditions, commodity prices, and financial, business and other factors could affect our operations and our ability to access the capital markets. We maintain investment grade ratings at all three primary credit rating agencies. A downgrade in our credit ratings could increase our future cost of financing or limit our ability to access capital and could result in additional credit support requirements. We do not have any triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an event of default in the case of a downgrade of our credit ratings. See Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 for a discussion of how a downgrade in our credit ratings could affect us. 38 Table of Contents We may incur additional debt in order to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, acquisitions or development activities or for general corporate or other purposes. A higher level of indebtedness could increase the risk that our liquidity and financial flexibility deteriorates. See Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 for a further discussion of how our level of indebtedness could affect us. Credit Arrangements and Borrowings In November 2022, we entered into a two-year $1.5 billion Term Loan Facility and borrowed the full amount thereunder in December 2022. The Term Loan Facility can be prepaid without penalty. Subsequent to the quarter, we repaid $250 million of outstanding borrowings on October 31, 2023. We have $1.3 billion in borrowings remaining under our Term Loan Facility. As of September 30, 2023, we had $5.3 billion of total long-term debt outstanding. Long-term debt due within one year consists of $200 million 2.1% Bonds and $200 million 2.125% Bonds which feature a mandatory put on July 1, 2024. In addition, as of September 30, 2023, we had outstanding commercial paper borrowings of $450 million. Both our Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility include a covenant requiring that our total debt to total capitalization ratio not exceed 65% as of the last day of the fiscal quarter. Our total debt-to-capital ratio was 26% at both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Refer to our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a listing of our long-term debt maturities. On April 3, 2023, we closed a $200 million remarketing to investors of sub-series 2017A-1 bonds that are part of the $1 billion St. John the Baptist, State of Louisiana revenue refunding bonds Series 2017. The bonds are subject to an interest rate of 4.05% and a mandatory purchase date of July 1, 2026. Other sources of liquidity We have an effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC pursuant to which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer for purposes of SEC rules, subject to market conditions, are permitted to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt, equity securities and other capital instruments, if and when necessary or perceived by us to be opportune, in one or more public offerings. Capital Requirements Share Repurchase Program Our Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program. Our remaining authorization at September 30, 2023 was approximately $1.4 billion. Subsequent to the quarter, our Board of Directors increased our remaining authorization to $2.5 billion effective on November 1, 2023. Dividends On October 25, 2023, our Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.11 per share payable December 11, 2023 to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 15, 2023. Income Taxes As described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the IRA was signed into law during 2022. Under current law and guidance, we do not anticipate being subject to the corporate book minimum tax in 2023 but anticipate that corporate book minimum tax will apply in 2024. The U.S. Treasury is expected to publish further guidance and regulations that will be relevant to scoping considerations and the calculation of minimum income tax liabilities. As this guidance is issued, we will continue to evaluate and assess the impact the IRA may have on our current and future period income taxes. Other Contractual Cash Obligations As of September 30, 2023, material changes to our contractual cash obligations compared to December 31, 2022 include the previously discussed repayment of $450 million outstanding borrowings against our $2.6 billion unsecured Revolving Credit Facility, which was due in 2027, and the addition of commercial paper borrowings of $450 million. In addition, we repaid $250 million of outstanding borrowings against our $1.5 billion Term Loan Facility on October 31, 2023. Other than the items set forth above, there are no material changes to our consolidated cash obligations to make future payments under existing contracts, as disclosed in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 39 Table of Contents Environmental Matters and Other Contingencies We have incurred and will continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately offset by the prices we receive for our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes. These laws generally provide for control of pollutants released into the environment and require responsible parties to undertake remediation of hazardous waste disposal sites. Penalties may be imposed for noncompliance. Other than the items set forth in Part II - Item 1. Legal Proceedings , there have been no significant changes to the environmental, health and safety matters under Item 1. Business or Item 3. Legal Proceedings in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of other contingencies.
