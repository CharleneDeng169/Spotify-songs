(Unaudited) 1. Basis of Presentation These consolidated financial statements are unaudited; however, in the opinion of management, these statements reflect all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the periods reported. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature unless disclosed otherwise. These consolidated financial statements, including notes, have been prepared in accordance with the applicable rules of the SEC and do not include all of the information and disclosures required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The results of operations for the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. 2. Accounting Standards Recently Adopted Financial instruments credit losses In June 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standards update that changes the impairment model for trade receivables, net investments in leases, debt securities, loans and certain other instruments. On January 1, 2020 we adopted this standard using the modified retrospective transition method through a cumulative-effect adjustment of $ 12 million to retained earnings as of the beginning of the adoption period. The standard requires the use of a forward-looking expected loss model as opposed to the incurred loss model used previously. See Note 8 for more information on credit losses. 3. Income (loss) and Dividends per Common Share Basic income (loss) per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted income (loss) per share assumes exercise of stock options in all periods, provided the effect is not antidilutive. The per share calculations below exclude 6 million of stock options for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 6 million and 5 million of stock options for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 that were antidilutive.

Dispositions International Segment In July 2019, we closed on the sale of our U.K. business (Marathon Oil U.K. LLC and Marathon Oil West of Shetlands Limited) for proceeds of $ 95 million which included the assumption by RockRose Energy PLC (the buyer) of the U.K. business cash equivalent balance and working capital balance as of year-end 2018. During the third quarter of 2019, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $ 14 million. Our income before income taxes relating to our U.K. business for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, was nil and $ 28 million. In the second quarter of 2019, we closed on the sale of our 15 % non-operated interest in the Atrush block in Kurdistan for proceeds of $ 63 million, before closing adjustments. 8 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 5. Revenues The majority of our revenues are derived from the sale of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas under spot and term agreements with our customers in the United States and various international locations. As of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, receivables from contracts with customers, included in receivables, less reserves were $ 502 million and $ 837 million, respectively.

Income Taxes Effective Tax Rate The effective income tax rate is influenced by a variety of factors including the geographic and functional sources of income and the relative magnitude of these sources of income. The difference between the total provision and the sum of the amounts allocated to segments is reported in the Not Allocated to Segments column of the tables in Note 6 . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, our effective income tax rates were as follows: Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Effective income tax rate (a) ( 2 ) % 6 % 1 % ( 27 ) % (a) In all periods presented, we maintained our valuation allowance on our net federal deferred tax assets in the U.S. The following items caused the effective income tax rates to be different from our U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% for 2020 and 2019: For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, the income tax rate was reduced below the statutory rate due to the valuation allowance on our net federal deferred tax assets in the U.S., which resulted in no federal tax benefit on the U.S. loss. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, the mix of pre-tax income in our international operations and the valuation allowance on our net federal deferred tax assets in the U.S., reduced the annual effective tax rate below the statutory tax rate . Income tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 were also impacted by the settlement of the 2010-2011 U.S. Federal Tax Audit in the first quarter of 2019, resulting in a tax benefit of $ 126 million. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2019, we recorded a non-cash deferred tax benefit of $ 18 million in the U.K. related to an internal restructuring. These two items are discrete to the first nine months of 2019. Excluding these discrete adjustments, the effective income tax rate for the first nine months of 2019 was an expense of 10 %. In the third quarter of 2020, we received an $ 89 million cash refund related to alternative minimum tax credits and interest. This refund was accelerated as a result of the enactment of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act , commonly referred to as the CARES Act, in the first quarter of 2020. 8. Credit Losses The majority of our receivables are from purchasers of commodities or joint interest owners in properties we operate, both of which are recorded at estimated or invoiced amounts and do not bear interest. The majority of these receivables have payment terms of 30 days or less. At the end of each reporting period, we assess the collectability of our receivables and estimate the expected credit losses using historical data, current market conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. We are exposed to credit losses through the receivables generated from sales of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas to our customers. When dealing with the commodity purchasers, we conduct a credit review to assess each counterparty ability to pay. The credit review considers our expected billing exposure, timing for payment and the counterparty established credit rating with the rating agencies or our internal assessment of the counterparty creditworthiness based on our analysis of their financial statements. Our evaluation also considers contract terms and other factors, such as country and/or political risk. A credit limit is established for each counterparty based on the outcome of this review. We may require a bank letter of credit or a prepayment to mitigate credit risk. We monitor our ongoing credit exposure through active review of counterparty balances against contract terms and due dates. The expected credit losses related to receivables with the commodity purchasers were determined using the weighted average probability of default method. We also collect revenues from our non-operated joint properties where other oil and gas exploration and production companies operate the properties and market our share of production and remit payments to us. The current expected credit losses related to these receivables were determined using the loss rate method applied to aging pools. 15 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) We are exposed to credit losses from joint interest billings to other joint interest owners for properties we operate. For this group of receivables, the expected credit losses are determined using the loss rate method applied to aging pools. Our counterparties in this group include numerous large, mid-size and small oil and gas exploration and production companies. Although we may have the ability to withhold future revenue disbursements to recover any non-payment of joint interest billings or require a prepayment of future costs through cash calls, our credit loss exposure with this group is more significant due to inherent ownership or billing adjustments. Also, some of our counterparties may experience liquidity problems and may not be able to meet their financial obligations to us. We expect that liquidity problems will increase in the future as a result of the recent demand and pricing decline for hydrocarbons. Our current-period provision reflects the anticipated effects caused by the recent market deterioration. Changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts balance for the nine months ended were as follows: (In millions) September 30, 2020 Beginning balance as of January 1 $ 11 Cumulative-effect adjustment 12 Current period provision (a) 22 Current period write offs ( 12 ) Recoveries of amounts previously reserved ( 8 ) Ending balance as of September 30 $ 25 (a) For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the current period provision increased by $ 10 million in joint interest receivables and $ 12 million in trade receivables. 9. Inventories Crude oil and natural gas are recorded at weighted average cost and carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Supplies and other items consist principally of tubular goods and equipment which are valued at weighted average cost and reviewed periodically for obsolescence or impairment when market conditions indicate. The continued volatility and future decline in crude oil and natural gas prices could affect the value of our inventories and result in future impairments. (In millions) September 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 Crude oil and natural gas $ 11 $ 10 Supplies and other items 66 62 Inventories $ 77 $ 72 10. Property, Plant and Equipment (In millions) September 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 United States $ 15,533 $ 16,427 International 424 493 Corporate 72 80 Net property, plant and equipment $ 16,029 $ 17,000 We had no e xploratory well costs capitalized greater than one year as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. 11. Impairments During the first quarter of 2020, a global pandemic caused a substantial deterioration in the worldwide demand of hydrocarbons. The decreased demand, when coupled with an oversupplied market, caused a corresponding deterioration in hydrocarbon prices. We reviewed our long-lived assets for indicators of impairment during the first quarter by conducting a sensitivity analysis of the most impactful inputs to their undiscounted cash flows, including commodity prices, capital spend and reductions in production volumes to correspond with lower capital spending. Our review concluded that the carrying amounts of our long-lived assets are recoverable; however, further deterioration or a more sustained decline of commodity prices may result in impairment charges in future periods. 16 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) We also reviewed our equity method investments for indicators of impairment. Equity method investments are assessed for impairment whenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value may have occurred. When a loss in value occurs that is deemed other than temporary, the carrying value of the equity method investment is written down to fair value. Our first quarter review concluded that any potential losses in values of our equity method investments were temporary because the underlying declines in both commodity prices and demand did not materially manifest until early March. However, during the second and third quarters of 2020, we recognized impairments related to one of our equity method investees, as noted in the tables below. The following table summarizes impairment charges of proved properties, goodwill and equity method investments and their corresponding fair values. Three Months Ended September 30, 2020 2019 (In millions) Fair Value Impairment Fair Value Impairment Long-lived assets held for use $ $ 1 $ $ Equity method investment $ 23 $ 18 N/A $ Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 2019 (In millions) Fair Value Impairment Fair Value Impairment Long-lived assets held for use $ $ 3 $ 56 $ 24 Goodwill $ $ 95 N/A $ Equity method investment $ 119 $ 170 N/A $ 2020 Impairments for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 include charges recognized for our equity method investments of $ 170 million. During the second quarter of 2020, the continuation of the depressed commodity prices caused us to perform a review of our equity method investments. Our review concluded that a loss of our investment value in one of our equity method investees was other than temporary and we recorded an impairment of $ 152 million based on the difference between our carrying value and the fair value of our investment. During the third quarter of 2020, we further reduced our long term price forecast of a gas index in which one of our equity method investees transacts, which resulted in an incremental reduction of our investment value. We recorded an impairment of $ 18 million during the third quarter, which we deemed other than temporary. Our remaining investments in equity method investees did not experience losses in value that caused the fair values to be below their carrying values. We estimated the fair value of our equity method investment using an income approach, specifically utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis. The estimated fair value was based on significant inputs not observable in the market, such as the amount of gas processed by the plant, future commodity prices, forecasted operating expenses, discount rate, and estimated cash returned to shareholders. Collectively, these inputs represent Level 3 measurements. The impairments of our equity method investments were recognized in income (loss) from equity method investments in our consolidated statements of income. The impairments caused us to incur a basis differential between the net book value of our investment and the amount of our underlying share of equity in the investee net assets. The amount of this basis differential is $ 140 million and will be accreted into income over the next 6.25 years, which is consistent with the remaining useful life of the investee primary assets. Impairments for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 also included $ 95 million of goodwill impairment in the International reporting unit. See Note 14 for further information. 2019 During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, we recorded proved property impairments of $ 24 million, as a result of the anticipated sales proceeds for certain non-core proved properties in our United States segment and the sale of our non-operated interest in the Atrush block (Kurdistan) in our International segment. The related fair value was measured using the market approach, based upon anticipated sales proceeds less costs to sell which resulted in a Level 2 classification. See Note 4 for further information. 17 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 12. Asset Retirement Obligations Asset retirement obligations primarily consist of estimated costs to remove, dismantle and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations. Changes in asset retirement obligations for the nine months ended September 30 were as follows: September 30, (In millions) 2020 2019 Beginning balance as of January 1 $ 255 $ 1,145 Incurred liabilities, including acquisitions 3 25 Settled liabilities, including dispositions ( 11 ) ( 1,106 ) Accretion expense (included in depreciation, depletion and amortization) 9 29 Revisions of estimates ( 8 ) 15 Held for sale 108 Ending balance as of September 30 $ 248 $ 216 September 30, 2020 Ending balance includes $ 12 million classified as short-term at September 30, 2020. September 30, 2019 Settled liabilities primarily relate to the sale of our U.K. business, which closed during the third quarter of 2019. Held for sale reflects a transfer to settled liabilities during 2019. This transfer was primarily related to the Droshky field (Gulf of Mexico), which was considered held for sale at year-end 2018 and closed in the first quarter of 2019. 13. Leases We enter into various lease agreements to support our operations including drilling rigs, well fracturing equipment, compressors, buildings, aircraft, vessels, vehicles and miscellaneous field equipment. We primarily act as a lessee in these transactions and all of our existing leases are classified as either short-term or long-term operating leases. Supplemental balance sheet information related to leases was as follows: (In millions) September 30, 2020 Operating Leases: Balance Sheet Location: Right-of-use asset Other noncurrent assets $ 137 Current portion of long-term lease liability Other current liabilities $ 79 Long-term lease liability Deferred credits and other liabilities $ 61 18 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Marathon E.G. Production Limited, is a lessor for residential housing in Equatorial Guinea, which is occupied by EGHoldings, a related party equity method investee see Note 24 . The lease was classified as an operating lease and expires in 2024, with a lessee option to extend through 2034. Lease payments are fixed for the entire duration of the agreement at approximately $ 6 million per year. Our lease income is reported in other income in our consolidated statements of income for all periods presented. The undiscounted cash flows to be received under this lease agreement are summarized below. (In millions) Operating Lease Future Cash Receipts 2020 $ 2 2021 6 2022 6 2023 6 2024 6 Thereafter 60 Total undiscounted cash flows $ 86 In 2018, we signed an agreement with an owner/lessor to construct and lease a new build-to-suit office building in Houston, Texas . The lessor and other participants are providing financing for up to $ 340 million to fund the estimated project costs, which was reduced effective August 2020, from $ 380 million to align with our revised estimate of the project costs. As of September 30, 2020, project costs incurred totaled approximately $ 117 million, including land acquisition and construction costs. The initial lease term is five years and will commence once construction is substantially complete and the new Houston office is ready for occupancy. At the end of the initial lease term, we can negotiate to extend the lease term for an additional five years , subject to the approval of the participants; purchase the property subject to certain terms and conditions; or remarket the property to an unrelated third party. The lease contains a residual value guarantee of approximately 89 % of the total acquisition and construction costs. 14. Goodwill As of December 31, 2019, our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of $ 95 million in the International reporting unit. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or between annual tests when events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill may have been reduced below its carrying value. During the first quarter of 2020, a global pandemic caused a substantial deterioration in the worldwide demand of hydrocarbons. This demand loss resulted in a significant decline in hydrocarbon prices. The commensurate decline in our market capitalization during the first quarter indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the International reporting unit was less than its carrying value. We estimated the fair value of our International reporting unit using a combination of market and income approaches. The market approach referenced observable inputs specific to us and our industry, such as the price of our common equity, our enterprise value, and valuation multiples of us and peers from the investor analyst community. The income approach utilized discounted cash flows, which were based on forecasted assumptions. Key assumptions to the income approach include future liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas pricing, estimated quantities of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas proved and probable reserves, estimated timing of production, discount rates, future capital requirements, operating expenses and tax rates. The assumptions used in the income approach are consistent with those that management uses to make business decisions. These valuation methodologies represent Level 3 fair value measurements. Based on the results, we concluded our goodwill was fully impaired, and recorded an impairment of $ 95 million in the consolidated statements of income for the first quarter of 2020. 19 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) September 30, (In millions) 2020 2019 Beginning balance as of January 1, gross $ 95 $ 97 Less: accumulated impairments Beginning balance, net 95 97 Dispositions ( 2 ) Impairment ( 95 ) Ending balance as of September 30, net $ $ 95 15. Derivatives For further information regarding the fair value measurement of derivative instruments, see Note 16 . All of our commodity derivatives are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements under which we report net amounts. The following tables present the gross fair values of derivative instruments and the reported net amounts along with where they appear on the consolidated balance sheets.

These derivatives consist of three-way collars, two-way collars, fixed price swaps, basis swaps, and NYMEX roll basis swaps. Three-way collars consist of a sold call (ceiling), a purchased put (floor) and a sold put. The ceiling price is the maximum we will receive for the contract volumes; the floor is the minimum price we will receive, unless the market price falls below the sold put strike price. In this case, we receive the NYMEX WTI price plus the difference between the floor and the sold put price. Two-way collars only consist of a sold call (ceiling) and a purchased put (floor). These crude oil, natural gas and NGL derivatives were not designated as hedges. The following table sets forth outstanding derivative contracts as of September 30, 2020, and the weighted average prices for those contracts: 2020 2021 2021 Fourth Quarter First Half Second Half Crude Oil NYMEX WTI Three-Way Collars Volume (Bbls/day) 80,000 Weighted average price per Bbl: Ceiling $ 64.40 $ $ Floor $ 55.00 $ $ Sold put $ 48.00 $ $ NYMEX WTI Two-Way Collars Volume (Bbls/day) 20,000 10,000 10,000 Weighted average price per Bbl: Ceiling $ 46.83 $ 52.37 $ 52.37 Floor $ 37.00 $ 35.00 $ 35.00 Basis Swaps - NYMEX WTI / Argus WTI Midland (a) Volume (Bbls/day) 15,000 Weighted average price per Bbl $ ( 0.94 ) $ $ Basis Swaps - NYMEX WTI / ICE Brent (b) Volume (Bbls/day) 5,000 1,630 Weighted average price per Bbl $ ( 7.24 ) $ ( 7.24 ) $ NYMEX Roll Basis Swaps Volume (Bbls/day) 30,000 Weighted average price per Bbl $ ( 0.81 ) $ $ Natural Gas Henry Hub ( HH ) Two-Way Collars Volume (MMBtu/day) 250,000 175,000 150,000 Weighted average price per MMBtu: Ceiling $ 2.82 $ 3.10 $ 3.03 Floor $ 2.25 $ 2.46 $ 2.43 Basis Swaps - WAHA / HH (c) Volume (MMBtu/day) 10,000 Weighted average price per MMBtu $ ( 0.37 ) $ $ NGL Fixed Price Ethane Swaps (d) Volume (Bbls/day) 10,000 Weighted average price per Bbl $ 8.78 $ $ (a) The basis differential price is indexed against Argus WTI Midland and NYMEX WTI.

Each respective derivative contract can be tied to an anticipated underlying dollar notional amount. During the third quarter of 2020, we de-designated these forward starting interest rate swaps previously designated as cash flow hedges. At September 30, 2020, accumulated other comprehensive income included a net deferred loss of $ 2 million related to the de-designated forward starting interest rate swaps previously designated as cash flow hedges. No portion of this amount has been reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income as of September 30, 2020. We expect to reclassify this amount into earnings as an adjustment to net interest and other upon the occurrence of the forecasted transactions.

We expect to refinance these debt maturities in 2025. The swaps will terminate on or prior to the refinancing of the debt and the final value will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings with each future interest payment. During 2019, we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $ 320 million to hedge variations in cash flows related to the 1-month LIBOR component of future lease payments of our future Houston office. These swaps will settle monthly on the same day the lease payment is made with the first swap settlement occurring in January 2022. We expect the first lease payment to commence sometime in the period from December 2021 to May 2022. The last swap will mature on September 9, 2026. See Note 13 for further details regarding the lease of the new Houston office. 23 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) The following table presents, by maturity date, information about our interest rate swap agreements, including the weighted average LIBOR-based, fixed rate.

See Note 15 . 24 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Commodity derivatives include three-way collars, two-way collars, fixed price swaps, basis swaps and NYMEX roll basis swaps. These instruments are measured at fair value using either a Black-Scholes or a modified Black-Scholes Model. For swaps, inputs to the models include only commodity prices and interest rates and are categorized as Level 1 because all assumptions and inputs are observable in active markets throughout the term of the instruments. For three-way collars and two-way collars, inputs to the models include commodity prices and implied volatility and are categorized as Level 2 because predominantly all assumptions and inputs are observable in active markets throughout the term of the instruments. The forward starting interest rate swaps are measured at fair value with a market approach using actionable broker quotes, which are Level 2 inputs. See Note 15 for detail on the forward starting interest rate swaps. Fair Value Estimates Goodwill See Note 14 for detail information relating to goodwill. Fair Values Nonrecurring See Note 11 for detail on our fair values related to impairments. Fair Values Financial Instruments Our current assets and liabilities include financial instruments, the most significant of which are receivables, the current portion of our long-term debt and payables. We believe the carrying values of our receivables and payables approximate fair value. Our fair value assessment incorporates a variety of considerations, including (1) the short-term duration of the instruments, (2) our credit rating and (3) our historical incurrence of and expected future insignificant bad debt expense, which includes an evaluation of counterparty credit risk. The following table summarizes financial instruments, excluding receivables, payables and derivative financial instruments, and their reported fair values by individual balance sheet line item at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. September 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 (In millions) Fair Value Carrying Amount Fair Value Carrying Amount Financial assets Current assets $ 4 $ 4 $ 4 $ 4 Other noncurrent assets 35 49 26 38 Total financial assets $ 39 $ 53 $ 30 $ 42 Financial liabilities Other current liabilities $ 62 $ 99 $ 62 $ 90 Long-term debt, including current portion (a) 6,044 5,931 6,174 5,529 Deferred credits and other liabilities 105 84 99 86 Total financial liabilities $ 6,211 $ 6,114 $ 6,335 $ 5,705 (a) Excludes debt issuance costs. Fair values of our financial assets included in other noncurrent assets, and of our financial liabilities included in other current liabilities and deferred credits and other liabilities, are measured using an income approach and most inputs are internally generated, which results in a Level 3 classification. Estimated future cash flows are discounted using a rate deemed appropriate to obtain the fair value. All of our long-term debt instruments are publicly traded. A market approach, based upon quotes from major financial institutions, which are Level 2 inputs, is used to measure the fair value of our debt. 25 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 17. Debt Revolving Credit Facility As of September 30, 2020, we had no borrowings against our $ 3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility ( Credit Facility ), as described below. The Credit Facility includes a covenant requiring our total debt to total capitalization ratio not to exceed 65 % as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. In the event of a default, the lenders holding more than half of the commitments may terminate the commitments under the Credit Facility and require the immediate repayment of all outstanding borrowings and the cash collateralization of all outstanding letters of credit under the Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2020, we were in compliance with this covenant with a ratio of 35 %. Debt Remarketing On August 18, 2020, we closed a $ 400 million remarketing to investors of sub-series B bonds which are part of the $ 1 billion St. John the Baptist, State of Louisiana revenue refunding bonds originally issued and purchased in December 2017 . The sub-series B bonds are subject to mandatory tender for purchase on the dates set forth in the table below. The following table further summarizes this transaction. Sub-Series B Bonds Par Amount Interest Rate Mandatory Purchase Date Maturity Date Sub-series B-1 Bonds $ 200 million 2.125 % July 1, 2024 June 1, 2037 Sub-series B-2 Bonds $ 200 million 2.375 % July 1, 2026 June 1, 2037 Debt Redemption On September 16, 2020, we commenced a cash tender offer for up to an aggregate principal amount of $ 500 million (the Aggregate Maximum Tender Amount ) of our outstanding $ 1 billion 2.8 % Senior Notes du e 2022 ( 2022 Notes ). The Aggregate Maximum Tender Amount was fully subscribed and we completed the early settlement on October 1, 2020, repaying the $ 500 million. A s such, the $ 500 million was moved to long-term due within one year on our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2020. The remaining $ 500 million of the 2.8 % 2022 Notes remains part of long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2020. 18. Stockholders Equity During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, we acquired approximately 9 million common shares at a cost of $ 85 million, which were held as treasury stock. Including these repurchases, the total remaining share repurchase authorization was $ 1.3 billion at September 30, 2020. Purchases under the program are made at our discretion and may be in either open market transactions, including block purchases, or in privately negotiated transactions using cash on hand, cash generated from operations or proceeds from potential asset sales. This program may be changed based upon our financial condition or changes in market conditions and is subject to termination prior to completion. 26 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 19.

Commitments and Contingencies In the second quarter of 2019, Marathon E.G. Production Limited ( MEGPL ), a consolidated and wholly-owned subsidiary, signed a series of agreements to process third-party Alen Unit gas through existing infrastructure located in Punta Europa, E.G. Our equity method investee, Alba Plant LLC, is also a party to some of the agreements. These agreements contain clauses that require MEGPL to indemnify the owners of the Alen Unit against injury to Alba Plant LLC personnel and damage to or loss of Alba Plant LLC automobiles, as well as third party claims caused by Alba Plant and certain environmental liabilities arising from certain hydrocarbons in the custody of Alba Plant LLC. Pursuant to these agreements, MEGPL agreed to indemnify third party property or events, including environmental liabilities, injury to Alba Plant LLC personnel, and damage to or loss of Alba Plant LLC automobiles. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate this obligation as we do not have any history of prior indemnification claims, and thus, we do not have any history of environmental discharge or contamination. Therefore, we have not recorded a liability with respect to these indemnities since the amount of potential future payments under these indemnification clauses is not determinable. The agreements to process the third-party Alen Unit gas required the execution of third-party guarantees by Marathon Oil Corporation in favor of the Alen Unit owners. Two separate guarantees were executed during the second quarter of 2020; one for a maximum of $ 91 million pertaining to the payment obligations of Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A. and another for a maximum of $ 25 million pertaining to the payment obligations of Alba Plant LLC. Payment by us would be required if either of those entities fails to honor its payment obligations pursuant to the relevant agreements with the owners of the Alen Unit. Certain owners of the Alen Unit, or their affiliates, are also direct or indirect shareholders in Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A. and Alba Plant LLC. Each guarantee expires no later than December 31, 2027. We measured these guarantees at fair value using the net present value of premium payments we expect to receive from our investees. Our liability for these guarantees was $ 4 million as of September 30, 2020, with a corresponding receivable from our investees. Each of Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A. and Equatorial Guinea LNG Train 1, S.A. provided us with a pledge of its receivables as recourse against any payments we may make under the guaranty of Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A. performance. Various groups, including the State of North Dakota and three Indian tribes represented by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, have been involved in a dispute regarding the ownership of certain lands underlying the Missouri River and Little Missouri River. As a result, as of September 30, 2020, we have a $ 103 million current liability in suspended royalty and working interest revenue, including interest, and have a long-term receivable of $ 23 million for capital and expenses. In December 2019, we received a Notice of Violation from the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality and a verbal notice of enforcement in January 2020 from the North Dakota Industrial Commission, related to a release of produced water in North Dakota. In January 2020, we received a Notice of Violation from the EPA related to the Clean Air Act. Each enforcement action will likely result in monetary sanctions in excess of $ 100,000 ; however, we do not believe these enforcement actions would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow. We are a defendant in a number of legal and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business including, but not limited to, royalty claims, contract claims, tax disputes and environmental claims. While the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We have incurred and will continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately offset by the prices we receive for our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes. These laws generally provide for control of pollutants released into the environment and require responsible parties to undertake remediation of hazardous waste disposal sites. Penalties may be imposed for noncompliance. 31 Item 2. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Overview Outlook Operations Market Conditions Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted Cash Flows Liquidity and Capital Resources Environmental Matters and Other Contingencies The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the preceding consolidated financial statements and notes in Item 1 . Executive Overview We are an independent exploration and production company based in Houston, Texas. Our strategy is to deliver competitive and improving corporate level returns by focusing our capital investment in the lower cost, higher margin U.S. resource plays (the Eagle Ford in Texas, the Bakken in North Dakota, STACK and SCOOP in Oklahoma and Northern Delaware in New Mexico). Commodity prices experienced significant volatility and declined substantially in the first half of 2020. While commodity prices improved during the third quarter as compared to the second quarter of 2020, they are likely to remain lower and volatile for the foreseeable future. We believe we can manage through this lower commodity price macro environment as our portfolio affords us the flexibility to respond to changing market conditions. Our primary focus remains on protecting our balance sheet and maintaining a strong liquidity position. We believe our financial strength, quality portfolio, and ongoing focus on reducing our cost structure better position us to navigate during this unprecedented time. The risks associated with COVID-19 impacted our workforce and the way we meet our business objectives. Due to concerns over health and safety, the vast majority of our corporate workforce works remotely as we plan a process for a phased return of employees to the office. Working remotely has not significantly impacted our ability to maintain operations, has allowed our field offices to operate without any disruption, and has not caused us to incur significant additional expenses; however, we are unable to predict the duration or ultimate impact of these measures. Key highlights include the following: Maintained focus on balance sheet and liquidity At the end of the third quarter 2020, we had approximately $4.1 billion of liquidity, comprised of an undrawn $3.0 billion revolving credit facility and $1.1 billion in cash. We remain investment grade at all three primary rating agencies. In August, we closed on the remarketing of $400 million sub-series B bonds. On October 1, 2020, we completed a cash tender for an aggregate principal amount of $500 million of our outstanding $1 billion 2.8% 2022 Notes. The tender was funded from cash on hand, resulting in a gross debt reduction of $100 million from the second quarter of 2020. The September 30, 2020 cash balance reflects an increase of approximately $261 million from year-end, primarily due to the remarketing of $400 million of sub-series B bonds, partially offset by repurchases of common stock and dividend payments made during the first quarter. Our cash provided from operations was commensurate with our capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. In early July 2020, we collected an $89 million cash refund related to alternative minimum tax credits and associated interest. 32 On October 1, the Board of Directors approved and declared the reinstatement of the base quarterly dividend of $0.03 per share, effective in the fourth quarter of 2020. Our share repurchase program remains suspended as we continue to maximize liquidity. Continued our capital discipline to be within our Capital Budget of $1.2 billion. Continued to opportunistically execute additional commodity derivatives to minimize the risk of price fluctuations. Financial and operational results U.S. net sales volumes decreased by 12% to 297 mboed, including a 21% reduction in U.S. crude oil net sales volumes compared to the same quarter last year as a result of overall lower wells to sales activity driven by the lower drilling and completions activity. Our net loss per share was $0.40 in the third quarter of 2020 as compared to net income per share of $0.21 in the same period last year. Included in our financial results for the current quarter: Revenues from contracts with customers decreased $488 million compared to the same quarter last year, largely due to lower price realizations and decreased production volumes. Average crude oil price realizations decreased by 37% during the third quarter of 2020 as compared to the third quarter of 2019. Net loss on commodity derivatives of $1 million for the third quarter of 2020, a $48 million decrease from the same period in 2019, which was a net gain of $47 million. A non-cash impairment of an investment in one of our equity method investees of $18 million. Net cash provided by operating activities in the first nine months of 2020 decreased to $1.1 billion or 49% primarily as a result of lower commodity price realizations and decreased production volumes, compared to the first nine months of 2019. As described in the preceding section, we reduced our Capital Budget such that Capital Budget expenditures are closely aligned with cash generated by operations over the duration of the year. Outlook Capital Budget Earlier this year, we announced an approved 2020 Capital Budget of $2.4 billion, including $200 million to fund resource play leasing and exploration ( REx ). In light of the substantial decline in commodity prices and oversupply in the market, our Board of Directors approved a reduction to our Capital Budget earlier in the year to a level of $1.3 billion. Due to strong execution and capital efficiency improvement, in August we further reduced our full year 2020 capital spending budget to $1.2 billion. This revised Capital Budget represents a 50% reduction of our original budget. The revised budget contemplates a full suspension of our Oklahoma activity in 2020, a decrease in Northern Delaware drilling activity, and a continued optimization of our development plans in the Bakken and Eagle Ford. This also completes our REx drilling program for 2020. Additional adjustments to capital spending plans may be necessary in the future to respond to the shifts in the macro environment. Commensurate with our budget of $1.2 billion for 2020, we believe our full year production volumes will be between 375 mboed to 390 mboed . Operations The following table presents a summary of our sales volumes for each of our segments. Refer to the Results of Operations section for a price-volume analysis for each of the segments. Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, Net Sales Volumes 2020 2019 Increase (Decrease) 2020 2019 Increase (Decrease) United States (mboed) 297 339 (12) % 314 322 (2) % International (mboed) (a) 71 88 (19) % 79 94 (16) % Total (mboed) 368 427 (14) % 393 416 (6) % (a) We closed on the sale of our U.K. business in the third quarter of 2019. The nine months ended September 30, 2019 includes net sales volumes related to the U.K. of 7 mboed. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. United States Net sales volumes in the segment were lower in the third quarter of 2020 and the first nine months of 2020 as compared to their respective 2019 periods. In the second quarter of 2020, we began the process of transitioning to a significantly lower level 33 of drilling and completion activity across our domestic portfolio. As a result of the decreased drilling and completion activity, fewer wells were brought to sales resulting in a significant decline in production in the third quarter of 2020. We continue to expect that our planned pace of drilling and completions activity during the remainder of the year will enable us to meet our 2020 production guidance as noted in the preceding Outlook section. The following tables provide additional details regarding net sales volumes, sales mix and operational drilling activity for our significant operations within this segment: Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, Net Sales Volumes 2020 2019 Increase (Decrease) 2020 2019 Increase (Decrease) Equivalent Barrels (mboed) Eagle Ford 91 107 (15) % 104 107 (3) % Bakken 98 109 (10) % 103 101 2 % Oklahoma 73 84 (13) % 69 77 (10) % Northern Delaware 27 30 (10) % 29 28 4 % Other United States 8 9 (11) % 9 9 % Total United States 297 339 (12) % 314 322 (2) % Three Months Ended September 30, 2020 Sales Mix - U.S. Resource Plays Eagle Ford Bakken Oklahoma Northern Delaware Total Crude oil and condensate 58 % 71 % 25 % 55 % 54 % Natural gas liquids 21 % 16 % 34 % 20 % 23 % Natural gas 21 % 13 % 41 % 25 % 23 % Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, Drilling Activity - U.S. Resource Plays 2020 2019 2020 2019 Gross Operated Eagle Ford: Wells drilled to total depth 17 31 58 97 Wells brought to sales 9 35 67 117 Bakken: Wells drilled to total depth 6 20 41 52 Wells brought to sales 8 30 41 89 Oklahoma: Wells drilled to total depth 15 9 53 Wells brought to sales 19 13 55 Northern Delaware: Wells drilled to total depth 10 15 37 Wells brought to sales 1 10 13 41 Eagle Ford Our net sales volumes were 91 mboed in the third quarter of 2020, including oil sales of 53 mbbld and we brought 9 gross company-operated wells to sales. Given the market conditions in the second quarter, we suspended frac activities. In the third quarter of 2020, we restarted our drilling program with 2 rigs and 1 frac crew which we expect to continue for the remainder of the year. Bakken Our net sales volumes were 98 mboed, including 69 mbbld of oil sales and we brought 8 gross company-operated wells to sales. We suspended frac activity in the second quarter. In the third quarter of 2020, we resumed completions activities. We plan to average 2 rigs and 1 frac crew for the remainder of the year. 34 Oklahoma Our net sales volumes were 73 mboed, including 18 mbbld of oil sales. During the second quarter, we suspended all drilling and completions operations in Oklahoma; we do not plan to drill any additional wells in Oklahoma during 2020. Northern Delaware Our net sales volumes were 27 mboed, including 15 mbbld of oil sales and we brought 1 gross company-operated well to sales. We suspended all drilling and completions operations during the second quarter and expect to bring only a limited number of wells to sales during the remainder of the year. International Net sales volumes were lower in the third quarter of 2020 compared to the third quarter of 2019 primarily due to timing of E.G. liftings. The following table provides details regarding net sales volumes for our operations within this segment: Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, Net Sales Volumes 2020 2019 Increase (Decrease) 2020 2019 Increase (Decrease) Equivalent Barrels (mboed) Equatorial Guinea 71 88 (19) % 79 86 (8) % United Kingdom (a) % 7 (100) % Other International % 1 (100) % Total International 71 88 (19) % 79 94 (16) % Equity Method Investees LNG (mtd) 3,960 4,590 (14) % 4,551 4,849 (6) % Methanol (mtd) 1,065 1,036 3 % 996 1,058 (6) % Condensate and LPG (boed) 9,340 11,586 (19) % 10,288 10,858 (5) % (a) Includes natural gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale. Equatorial Guinea Net sales volumes in the third quarter of 2020 were lower compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to timing of liftings. United Kingdom In July 2019, we closed on the sale of our U.K. business. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. 35 Market Conditions Commodity prices are the most significant factor impacting our revenues, profitability, operating cash flows, the amount of capital we invest in our business, payment of dividends and funding of share repurchases. Commodity prices declined substantially in the first half of 2020 resulting from demand contraction related to the global pandemic and increased supply following the OPEC decision to increase production. A revised OPEC deal to reduce production was agreed early in the second quarter of 2020 and oil prices partially recovered in the latter part of the second quarter. Prices continued to increase in the third quarter; however, pricing remains lower relative to 2019 and given the scale of worldwide demand contraction, we expect commodity prices to remain volatile. Refer to Ite m 1A. Risk Factors in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion on how further declines in commodity prices could impact us. United States The following table presents our average price realizations and the related benchmarks for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas for the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 and 2019.

Equatorial Guinea Crude oil and condensate Alba field liquids production is primarily condensate and generally sold in relation to the Brent crude benchmark. Alba Plant LLC processes the rich hydrocarbon gas which is supplied by the Alba field under a fixed price long term contract. Alba Plant LLC extracts NGLs and secondary condensate which is then sold by Alba Plant LLC at market prices, with our share of the revenue reflected in income from equity method investments on the consolidated statements of income. Alba Plant LLC delivers the processed dry natural gas to the Alba field for distribution and sale to AMPCO and EG LNG. Natural gas liquids Wet gas is sold to Alba Plant LLC at a fixed-price term contract resulting in realized prices not tracking market price. Alba Plant LLC extracts and keeps NGLs, which are sold at market price, with our share of income from Alba Plant LLC being reflected in the income from equity method investments on the consolidated statements of income. Natural gas Dry natural gas, processed by Alba Plant LLC on behalf of the Alba field is sold by the Alba field to EG LNG and AMPCO at fixed-price long term contracts resulting in realized prices not tracking market price. We derive additional value from the equity investment in our downstream gas processing units EG LNG and AMPCO. EG LNG sells LNG on a market-based long-term contract and AMPCO markets methanol at market prices.

We have multiple crude oil, natural gas and NGL derivative contracts that settle against various indices. We record commodity derivative gains/losses as the index pricing and forward curves change each period. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Income from equity method investments decreased $31 million for the third quarter of 2020 from the comparable 2019 period primarily due to an impairment of $18 million to an investment in an equity method investee. Lower Alba plant condensate sales volumes and lower methanol prices at AMPCO methanol facility also contributed to the decline. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the equity method investee impairment. Net gain on disposal of assets decreased $21 million in the third quarter of 2020 versus the same period in 2019, primarily as a result of the sale of our U.K. business during third quarter of 2019. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for more detail. Production expenses decreased $34 million in the third quarter of 2020 versus the same period in 2019, primarily as a result of the U.S. segment lower operational costs and continued cost management, specifically staffing and contract labor. International segment production expense slightly decreased due to timing of E.G. liftings. The following table provides production expense and production expense rates (expense per boe) for each segment: Three Months Ended September 30, ($ in millions; rate in $ per boe) 2020 2019 Increase (Decrease) 2020 2019 Increase (Decrease) Production Expense and Rate Expense Rate United States $ 118 $ 147 (20) % $ 4.32 $ 4.75 (9) % International $ 11 $ 16 (31) % $ 1.76 $ 1.98 (11) % Shipping, handling and other operating expenses increased $45 million in the third quarter of 2020 primarily due to increased purchased volumes from third parties of commodities for resale in order to satisfy transportation commitments and other expenses. Exploration expenses include unproved property impairments, dry well costs, geological and geophysical, and other costs, which remained relatively flat in comparison to the third quarter of 2019. The following table summarizes the components of exploration expenses: Three Months Ended September 30, (In millions) 2020 2019 Increase (Decrease) Exploration Expenses Unproved property impairments $ 23 $ 15 53 % Dry well costs 1 (100) % Geological and geophysical 2 1 100 % Other 2 5 (60) % Total exploration expenses $ 27 $ 22 23 % Depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased $68 million in the third quarter of 2020 as a result of lower sales volumes in our U.S. and International segments. Our segments apply the units-of-production method to the majority of their assets, including capitalized asset retirement costs; therefore volumes have an impact on DD&A expense. The DD&A rate (expense per boe) is impacted by field-level changes in reserves, capitalized costs and sales volume mix between fields. The following table provides DD&A expense and DD&A expense rates for each segment: 38 Three Months Ended September 30, ($ in millions; rate in $ per boe) 2020 2019 Increase (Decrease) 2020 2019 Increase (Decrease) DD&A Expense and Rate Expense Rate United States $ 530 $ 589 (10) % $ 19.39 $ 18.90 3 % International $ 19 $ 25 (24) % $ 2.89 $ 3.15 (8) % Taxes other than income include production, severance and ad valorem taxes, primarily in the U.S., which tend to increase or decrease in relation to revenue and sales volumes. Taxes other than income decreased $32 million primarily due to lower price realizations and lower sales volumes in the U.S. segment in the third quarter of 2020. General and administrative expenses decreased $29 million in the third quarter of 2020 primarily as a result of cost savings realized from workforce reductions. Segment Income Segment income represents income which excludes certain items not allocated to our operating segments, net of income taxes. A portion of our corporate and operations general and administrative support costs are not allocated to the operating segments. These unallocated costs primarily consist of employment costs (including pension effects), professional services, facilities and other costs associated with corporate and operations support activities. Additionally, items which affect comparability such as: gains or losses on dispositions, impairments of proved property, goodwill and equity method investments, unrealized gains or losses on commodity and interest rate derivative instruments, effects of pension settlements and curtailments, or other items (as determined by the CODM) are not allocated to operating segments. The following table reconciles segment income (loss) to net income (loss): Three Months Ended September 30, (In millions) 2020 2019 Increase (Decrease) United States $ (135) $ 180 (175) % International 8 43 (81) % Segment income (loss) (127) 223 (157) % Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes (190) (58) (228) % Net income (loss) $ (317) $ 165 (292) % United States segment income (loss) in the third quarter of 2020, was $135 million loss after-tax versus $180 million income after-tax for the same period in 2019, primarily due to lower price realizations and sales volumes in the current quarter, which was partially offset by lower DD&A and production taxes (due to the lower sales volumes), coupled with cost management efforts to lower production and G&A expenses. International segment income in the third quarter of 2020, was $8 million after-tax versus $43 million after-tax for the same period in 2019, primarily due to timing of E.G. liftings and lower price realizations resulting in lower income from equity method investments. Results of Operations Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 vs. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 Revenues from contracts with customers are presented by segment in the table below: Nine Months Ended September 30, (In millions) 2020 2019 Revenues from contracts with customers United States $ 2,154 $ 3,434 International 121 396 Segment revenues from contracts with customers $ 2,275 $ 3,830 39 Below is a price/volume analysis for each segment. Refer to the preceding Operations and Market Conditions sections for additional detail related to our net sales volumes and average price realizations.

We have multiple crude oil, natural gas and NGL derivative contracts that settle against various indices. We record commodity derivative gains/losses as the index pricing and forward curves change each period. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Income (loss) from equity method investments decreased $237 million for the first nine months of 2020 primarily due to impairments of $170 million to an investment in an equity method investee in the first nine months of 2020 as well as lower price realizations and lower net sales volumes from equity method investments in E.G. primarily due to the planned triennial turnaround in the first quarter of 2020. Net gain on disposal of assets decreased $48 million for the first nine months of 2020 primarily as a result of the sale of our working interest in the Droshky field (Gulf of Mexico) and U.K. business during the first nine months of 2019. Other income decreased $38 million in the first nine months of 2020 primarily due to income recognized in 2019 arising from indemnification payments received from Marathon Petroleum Corporation ( MPC ). Pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement we entered into with MPC, in connection with the 2011 spin-off transaction, MPC agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. The indemnity relates to tax and interest allocable to MPC as a result of the closure of the 2010-2011 U.S. Federal Tax Audit in the first quarter of 2019. Production expenses for the first nine months of 2020 decreased by $125 million compared to the same period in 2019. Production expense in our International segment decreased $69 million primarily as a result of the sale of our U.K. business, which closed during the third quarter of 2019. Production expense in our U.S. segment decreased $58 million primarily due to lower operational activity and continued cost management, specifically staffing and contract labor. The first nine months of 2020 production expense rate (expense per boe) was lower for our United States segment due to the aforementioned reasons. Expense per boe for our International segment decreased due to the sale of the U.K. business, which closed during the third quarter of 2019 . We expect our full year production expense rates for the United States and International segments to be $4.25 - $4.75 per boe and $2.05 - $2.35 per boe, respectively. The following table provides production expense and production expense rates for each segment: Nine Months Ended September 30, ($ in millions; rate in $ per boe) 2020 2019 Increase (Decrease) 2020 2019 Increase (Decrease) Production Expense and Rate Expense Rate United States $ 375 $ 433 (13) % $ 4.36 $ 4.94 (12) % International $ 43 $ 112 (62) % $ 2.00 $ 4.33 (54) % Shipping, handling and other operating expenses decreased $30 million in the first nine months of 2020 from the comparable 2019 period, primarily as a result of lower net sales volumes in the U.S during the first nine months of 2020 and 40 lower NGL shipping and handling rates realized in Bakken in the second quarter of 2020. This was partially offset by higher marketing costs due to higher volumes purchased for resale during the third quarter of 2020. Exploration expenses include unproved property impairments, dry well costs, geological and geophysical, and other, which decreased $26 million in the first nine months of 2020. Decreases in unproved property impairments were primarily driven by our decision not to drill certain leases related to resource exploration in the first quarter of 2019. The following table summarizes the components of exploration expenses: Nine Months Ended September 30, (In millions) 2020 2019 Increase (Decrease) Exploration Expenses Unproved property impairments $ 62 $ 79 (22) % Dry well costs 1 6 (83) % Geological and geophysical 6 10 (40) % Other 12 12 % Total exploration expenses $ 81 $ 107 (24) % Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $14 million in the first nine months of 2020 from the comparable 2019 period, primarily due to additional wells coming online in 2020 related to our resource exploration development coupled with field-level reserve adjustments increasing the United States DD&A expense. This was partially offset by the sale of our U.K. business, which closed during the third quarter of 2019. Our segments apply the units-of-production method to the majority of their assets, including capitalized asset retirement costs; therefore volumes have an impact on DD&A expense. The DD&A rate (expense per boe) is impacted by field-level changes in reserves, capitalized costs and sales volume mix between fields. The DD&A rate for International decreased primarily as a result of dispositions. The following table provides DD&A expense and DD&A expense rates for each segment: Nine Months Ended September 30, ($ in millions; rate in $ per boe) 2020 2019 Increase (Decrease) 2020 2019 Increase (Decrease) DD&A Expense and Rate Expense Rate United States $ 1,716 $ 1,664 3 % $ 19.91 $ 18.95 5 % International $ 62 $ 97 (36) % $ 2.87 $ 3.77 (24) % Impairments increased $74 million in the first nine months of 2020, primarily as a result of the impairment to goodwill for $95 million related to our International reporting unit in the first quarter of 2020. See Note 11 for discussion of the impairments in further detail. Taxes other than income include production, severance and ad valorem taxes, primarily in the U.S., which tend to increase or decrease in relation to revenue and sales volumes. Taxes other than income decreased $87 million in the first nine months of 2020 from the comparable 2019 period primarily due to lower price realizations and lower sales volumes in the U.S. segment. General and administrative expenses decreased $46 million in the first nine months of 2020 from the comparable 2019 period, which reflects costs savings realized from workforce reductions. Provision (benefit) for income taxes reflects an effective income tax rate of 1% in the first nine months of 2020, as compared to an effective income tax rate of (27)% for the comparable 2019 period. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion concerning the components impacting the rate change. 41 Segment Income Segment income represents income which excludes certain items not allocated to our operating segments, net of income taxes. A portion of our corporate and operations general and administrative support costs are not allocated to the operating segments. These unallocated costs primarily consist of employment costs (including pension effects), professional services, facilities and other costs associated with corporate and operations support activities. Additionally, items which affect comparability such as: gains or losses on dispositions, impairments of proved property, goodwill and equity method investments, unrealized gains or losses on commodity and interest rate derivative instruments, effects of pension settlements and curtailments, or other items (as determined by the CODM) are not allocated to operating segments. The following table reconciles segment income (loss) to net income (loss): Nine Months Ended September 30, (In millions) 2020 2019 Increase (Decrease) United States $ (520) $ 527 (199) % International 1 200 (100) % Segment income (loss) (519) 727 (171) % Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes (594) (227) (162) % Net income (loss) $ (1,113) $ 500 (323) % United States segment income (loss) for the first nine months of 2020, was a $520 million loss after-tax versus $527 million income after-tax for the same period in 2019, primarily as a result of lower crude price realizations and lower net sales volumes, which was partially offset by lower production taxes and production expenses. International segment income for the first nine months of 2020, was $1 million after-tax versus $200 million after-tax for the same period in 2019, primarily due to lower price realizations and sales volumes partially offset by lower costs due to the sale of our U.K. business in third quarter of 2019. Critical Accounting Estimates There have been no material changes or developments in the evaluation of the accounting estimates and the underlying assumptions or methodologies pertaining to our Critical Accounting Estimates disclosed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, except as discussed below. Impairment of Equity Method Investments During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, we recorded an impairment of $170 million to an investment in an equity method investee, which was reflected in income (loss) from equity method investments in our consolidated statements of income. Equity method investments are assessed for impairment whenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value may have occurred. When a loss is deemed to have occurred that is other than temporary, the carrying value of the equity method investment is written down to fair value. Fair value calculated for the purpose of testing our equity method investees for impairment is estimated using the present value of expected future cash flows method. Significant judgment is involved in performing these fair value estimates since the results are based on forecasted assumptions and the performance of entities that we do not control. Significant assumptions include: Future condensate, NGL, LNG, natural gas & methanol prices. Our estimates of future prices are based on our analysis of market supply and demand and consideration of market price indicators. Although these commodity prices may experience extreme volatility in any given year, we believe long-term industry prices are driven by global market supply and demand. To estimate supply, we consider numerous factors, including the worldwide resource base, depletion rates and OPEC production policies. We believe demand is largely driven by global economic factors, such as population and income growth, and governmental policies. The prices we use in our fair value estimates are consistent with those used in our planning and capital investment reviews. There has been significant volatility in commodity prices and estimates of such future prices are inherently imprecise. See Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 for further discussion on commodity prices. 42 Estimated quantities of feedstock condensate, NGLs and natural gas processed by our investees. There are two primary sets of inputs used to estimate feedstock volumes processed by our investees. The first input involves hydrocarbons produced from our Alba Field. Our equity method investees currently process hydrocarbons from our Alba Field, which consists of condensate, NGLs and natural gas reserves. Estimated quantities of hydrocarbons processed from our Alba Field are based on a combination of proved reserves and risk-weighted probable reserves and resources such that the combined volumes represent the most likely expectation of recovery. See Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 for further discussion on reserves. The second input involves our estimate of future third-party gas to be processed by our investees. Our investees have capacity to process hydrocarbons from sources other than our Alba field. During 2019, we executed agreements for processing natural gas produced from the third party-owned Alen Unit through the existing Alba Plant LLC LPG processing plant and the EGHoldings LNG production facility beginning in 2021. Estimated natural gas volumes processed from the Alen Unit were based on forecasts received from the operator of the Alen Unit. Expected timing of production. Production forecasts are the outcome of engineering studies which estimate reserves, as well as expected capital programs. The actual timing of the production could be different than the projection. Cash flows realized later in the projection period are less valuable than those realized earlier due to the time value of money. The expected timing of production from the Alba Field that we use in our fair value estimates is consistent with that used in our planning and capital investment reviews. The expected timing of production from the Alen Unit is consistent with forecasts received from the operator of that field. Discount rate commensurate with the risks involved. We apply a discount rate to our expected cash flows based on a variety of factors, including market and economic conditions, operational risk, regulatory risk and political risk. A higher discount rate decreases the net present value of cash flows We base our fair value estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonably likely to occur. This includes the estimated dividends and/or return of capital we expect to be paid by our equity method investees, which are directly affected by the significant assumptions described in the preceding paragraphs. An estimate of the sensitivity to changes in assumptions in our cash flow calculations is not practicable, given the numerous other assumptions (e.g. reserves, commodity prices, operating costs, inflation and discount rates) that can materially affect our estimates. Unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions would likely be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the impairment recognized during the second and third quarter of 2020. Fair Value Estimates Goodwill In the first quarter of 2020, a triggering event (significant decline in market capitalization caused by worldwide declines in hydrocarbon demand and corresponding prices) required us to assess our goodwill in the International reporting unit for impairment as of March 31, 2020. We estimated the fair value of our International reporting unit using a combination of market and income approaches and concluded that a full impairment of $95 million was required. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Estimated Quantity of Net Reserves Continued lower commodity prices could have a material effect on the quantity and present value of our proved reserves. When we apply actual SEC pricing as of year-end, a portion of our proved reserves could be deemed uneconomic and no longer classified as proved. This could impact both proved developed producing reserves as well as proved undeveloped reserves. Future reserve revisions could also result from changes to our Capital Budget and drilling plans among other things. However, any impact of lower SEC pricing will likely be partially offset by continued cost reduction efforts. Also, any volumes reclassified to unproved reserves could return to proved reserves as commodity prices improve. Any reduction in proved reserves, especially as a result of continued lower commodity prices, could result in an acceleration of future DD&A expense and impairments to long-lived assets. Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. 43 Cash Flows Commodity prices are the most significant factor impacting our revenues, profitability, operating cash flows, the amount of capital we invest in our business, payment of dividends, and funding of share repurchases. While we generated cash flows from operations during the first nine months of 2020, the lower price environment reduced our cash flow generation compared to the prior year. Should lower prices continue, our ability to generate cash from operations could be negatively affected. The following table presents sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents: Nine Months Ended September 30, (In millions) 2020 2019 Sources of cash and cash equivalents Operating activities $ 1,055 $ 2,049 Borrowings 400 Disposal of assets, net of cash transferred to the buyer 9 (84) Other 7 53 Total sources of cash and cash equivalents $ 1,471 $ 2,018 Uses of cash and cash equivalents Additions to property, plant and equipment $ (1,090) $ (1,934) Additions to other assets 15 41 Purchases of common stock (92) (296) Dividends paid (40) (122) Other (3) (4) Total uses of cash and cash equivalents $ (1,210) $ (2,315) Cash flows generated from operating activities in the first nine months of 2020 were 49% lower compared to the same period in 2019, primarily as a result of lower commodity price realizations. The following table shows capital expenditures by segment and reconciles to additions to property, plant and equipment as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows: Nine Months Ended September 30, (In millions) 2020 2019 United States $ 874 $ 1,959 International 16 Corporate 10 15 Total capital expenditures 884 1,990 Change in capital expenditure accrual 206 (56) Total use of cash and cash equivalents for property, plant and equipment $ 1,090 $ 1,934 The decline in our capital expenditures for the U.S. segment in the first nine months of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, was caused by lower drilling and completions activities across all four of our shale basins. In the first quarter of 2020, we acquired approximately 9 million common shares at a cost of $85 million, which were held as treasury stock. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Liquidity and Capital Resources Available Liquidity Our main sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, internally generated cash flow from operations, sales of non-core assets, capital market transactions, and our revolving Credit Facility. At September 30, 2020, we had approximately $4.1 billion of liquidity consisting of $1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $3.0 billion available under our revolving Credit Facility. On October 1, 2020, we completed a cash tender offer for an aggregate principal amount of $500 million of our $1 billion 2.8% 2022 Notes funded by cash on hand. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a more detailed discussion of recent developments affecting the energy industry. 44 Our working capital requirements are supported by our cash and cash equivalents and our Credit Facility. We may draw on our revolving Credit Facility to meet short-term cash requirements, or issue debt or equity securities through the shelf registration statement discussed below as part of our longer-term liquidity and capital management program. Because of the alternatives available to us as discussed above, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity are adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements including our capital spending programs, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities, and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies. General economic conditions, commodity prices, and financial, business and other factors, including the global pandemic, could affect our operations and our ability to access the capital markets. During the first half of 2020, commodity prices significantly declined due to the combined impacts of global crude oil oversupply and lower demand for hydrocarbons due to the global pandemic. As a result, credit rating agencies reviewed many companies in the industry, including us. We continue to be rated investment grade at all three primary credit rating agencies. A downgrade in our credit ratings could increase our future cost of financing or limit our ability to access capital, and could result in additional credit support requirements. See Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 for a discussion of how a downgrade in our credit ratings could affect us. During the second quarter of this year, our Board of Directors temporarily suspended our quarterly dividend payment as we prioritize our liquidity and balance sheet. On October 1, 2020, our Board of Directors approved the reinstatement of and declared a base quarterly dividend of $0.03 per share payable December 10, 2020 to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 18, 2020. Capital Resources Credit Arrangements and Borrowings At September 30, 2020, we had no borrowings against our Credit Facility. At September 30, 2020, we had $5.9 billion of total debt outstandin g. On October 1, 2020, we completed a cash tender offer for an aggregate principal amount of $500 million of our $1 billion 2.8% 2022 Notes funded by cash on hand. After giving consideration to the cash tender, our next significant debt maturity is $500 million due in November 2022. We do not have any triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an event of default in the case of a downgrade of our credit ratings. On August 18, 2020, we clo sed a $400 million remarketing to investors of sub-series B bonds which are part of the $1.0 billion St. John the Baptist, State of Louisiana revenue refunding bonds originally issued and purchased in December 2017. Information about these bonds are available on the website of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board via its Electronic Municipal Market Access system at www.msrb.org . Information on that website is not incorporated by reference into this filing. In 2018, we signed an agreement with an owner/lessor to construct and lease a new build-to-suit office building in Houston, Texas . The lessor and other participants are providing financing for up to $340 million to fund the estimated project costs, which was reduced effective August 2020 from $380 million to ali gn with our revised estimate of the project costs. As of September 30, 2020, project costs incurred totaled approximately $117 million, including land acquisition and construction costs. Shelf Registration We have a universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer for purposes of SEC rules, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities. Debt-To-Capital Ratio The Credit Facility includes a covenant requiring that our total debt to total capitalization ratio not exceed 65% as of the last day of the fiscal quarter. Our ratio was 35% and 31% at September 30, 2020 and at December 31, 2019, respectively. Capital Requirements Share Repurchase Program In the first quarter of 2020, we acquired approximately 9 million common shares at a cost of $85 million under our share repurchase program. While the share repurchase program has $1.3 billion of remaining authorization, we elected to suspend additional share repurchases to preserve liquidity. 45 Contractual Cash Obligations As of September 30, 2020, our contractual obligations as it relates to our short and long-term debt increased by $400 million ($200 million in 2024 a nd $200 million thereafter) due to the remarketing of the St. John the Baptist, State of Louisiana revenue refunding bonds. On October 1, 2020, we completed a cash tender for an aggregate principal amount of $500 million of our outstandi ng $1 billion 2.8% 2022 Notes. The tender was funded from cash on hand, resulting in a gross debt reduction of $100 million from the second quarter of 2020. As of September 30, 2020, our contractual cash obligations as it relates to our transportation and processing commitments decreased approximately $79 million ($8 million in 2021, $11 million in 2022, $11 million in 2023, $11 million in 2024 and $38 million thereafter) related to the cancellation of a transportation service agreement in the Bakken resource play. Environmental Matters and Other Contingencies We have incurred and will continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately offset by the prices we receive for our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes. These laws generally provide for control of pollutants released into the environment and require responsible parties to undertake remediation of hazardous waste disposal sites. Penalties may be imposed for noncompliance. Other than the items set forth in Item 1. Legal Proceedings, there have been no significant changes to the environmental, health and safety matters under Item 1. Business or Item 3. Legal Proceedings in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of other contingencies. 46 Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ).
