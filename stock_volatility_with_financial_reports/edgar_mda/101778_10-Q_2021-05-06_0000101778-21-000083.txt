Basis of Presentation These consolidated financial statements are unaudited; however, in the opinion of management, these statements reflect all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the periods reported. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature unless disclosed otherwise. These consolidated financial statements, including notes, have been prepared in accordance with the applicable rules of the SEC and do not include all of the information and disclosures required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The results of operations for the first quarter of 2021 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. 2. Accounting Standards No accounting standards were adopted in the first quarter of 2021 that had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 3. Income (loss) and Dividends per Common Share Basic income (loss) per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted income (loss) per share assumes exercise of stock options in all periods, provided the effect is not antidilutive. The per share calculations below exclude 6 million of stock options for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 that were antidilutive. Three Months Ended March 31, (In millions, except per share data) 2021 2020 Net income (loss) $ 97 $ ( 46 ) Weighted average common shares outstanding 789 794 Effect of dilutive securities Weighted average common shares, diluted 789 794 Net income (loss) per share: Basic $ 0.12 $ ( 0.06 ) Diluted $ 0.12 $ ( 0.06 ) Dividends per share $ 0.03 $ 0.05 4. Revenues The majority of our revenues are derived from the sale of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas under spot and term agreements with our customers in the United States and Equatorial Guinea. As of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, receivables from contracts with customers, included in receivables, less reserves were $ 761 million and $ 572 million, respectively. 7 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) The following tables present our revenues from contracts with customers disaggregated by product type and geographic areas for the three months ended March 31 as follows: United States March 31, 2021 (In millions) Eagle Ford Bakken Oklahoma Northern Delaware Other U.S. Total Crude oil and condensate $ 259 $ 372 $ 61 $ 77 $ 22 $ 791 Natural gas liquids 26 41 37 9 3 116 Natural gas 47 25 109 25 9 215 Other 2 8 10 Revenues from contracts with customers $ 334 $ 438 $ 207 $ 111 $ 42 $ 1,132 March 31, 2020 (In millions) Eagle Ford Bakken Oklahoma Northern Delaware Other U.S. Total Crude oil and condensate $ 307 $ 330 $ 84 $ 74 $ 33 $ 828 Natural gas liquids 16 10 21 3 2 52 Natural gas 23 8 29 3 3 66 Other 2 22 24 Revenues from contracts with customers $ 348 $ 348 $ 134 $ 80 $ 60 $ 970 International (E.G.)

Segment Information We have two reportable operating segments. Both of these segments are organized and managed based upon geographic location and the nature of the products and services offered. United States ( U.S. ) explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas in the United States International ( Int l ) explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas outside of the United States as well as produces and markets products manufactured from natural gas, such as LNG and methanol, in Equatorial Guinea ( E.G. ) Segment income represents income which excludes certain items not allocated to our operating segments, net of income taxes. A portion of our corporate and operations general and administrative support costs are not allocated to the operating segments. These unallocated costs primarily consist of employment costs (including pension effects), professional services, facilities and other costs associated with corporate and operations support activities. Additionally, items which affect comparability such as: gains or losses on dispositions, impairments of proved and certain unproved properties, goodwill, and equity method investments, unrealized gains or losses on commodity and interest rate derivative instruments, effects of pension settlements and curtailments or other items (as determined by the chief operating decision maker ( CODM )) are not allocated to operating segments. Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 (In millions) U.S. Int l Not Allocated to Segments Total Revenues from contracts with customers $ 1,132 $ 45 $ $ 1,177 Net gain (loss) on commodity derivatives ( 71 ) ( 82 ) (b) ( 153 ) Income (loss) from equity method investments 44 44 Other income 1 1 1 3 Less costs and expenses: Production 111 10 121 Shipping, handling and other operating 144 4 4 152 Exploration 21 21 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 472 19 5 496 Impairments 1 1 Taxes other than income 74 74 General and administrative 23 2 64 (c) 89 Net interest and other 13 (d) 13 Other net periodic benefit costs ( 3 ) ( 3 ) Income tax provision 5 5 10 Segment income (loss) $ 212 $ 50 $ ( 165 ) $ 97 Total assets $ 15,949 $ 1,046 $ 1,238 $ 18,233 Capital expenditures (a) $ 183 $ $ 1 $ 184 (a) Includes accruals.

(c) Includes $ 13 million associated with the termination of an aircraft lease agreement and $ 11 million arising from severance expenses associated with a workforce reduction. (d) Includes a $ 41 million gain on 2022 interest rate swaps not designated as cash flow hedges. 9 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Three Months Ended March 31, 2020 (In millions) U.S. Int l Not Allocated to Segments Total Revenues from contracts with customers $ 970 $ 54 $ $ 1,024 Net gain on commodity derivatives 31 171 (b) 202 Income (loss) from equity method investments ( 12 ) ( 12 ) Net gain on disposal of assets 9 9 Other income 4 2 1 7 Less costs and expenses: Production 143 17 160 Shipping, handling and other operating 140 3 1 144 Exploration 28 28 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 617 21 6 644 Impairments 97 (c) 97 Taxes other than income 66 66 General and administrative 32 4 40 76 Net interest and other 64 64 Income tax benefit ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) Segment loss $ ( 20 ) $ ( 1 ) $ ( 25 ) $ ( 46 ) Total assets $ 17,453 $ 1,405 $ 857 $ 19,715 Capital expenditures (a) $ 561 $ $ 7 $ 568 (a) Includes accruals.

(c) Includes the full impairment of the International reporting unit goodwill of $ 95 million (see Note 13 ). 10 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 6. Income Taxes Effective Tax Rate The effective income tax rate is influenced by a variety of factors including the geographic and functional sources of income and the relative magnitude of these sources of income. The difference between the total provision and the sum of the amounts allocated to segments is reported in the Not Allocated to Segments column of the tables in Note 5 . For the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, our effective income tax rates were as follows: Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 2020 Effective income tax rate 9 % 6 % The following items caused the effective income tax rates to be different from our U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% for 2021 and 2020: We currently have a valuation allowance on net federal deferred tax assets in the U.S., which results in no federal deferred tax expense or benefit on current year U.S. activity. This impact along with the income mix within E.G. between equity method investees and subsidiaries reduces the effective tax rate below the statutory tax rate for the periods ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. 7. Credit Losses The majority of our receivables are from purchasers of commodities or joint interest owners in properties we operate, both of which are recorded at estimated or invoiced amounts and do not bear interest. The majority of these receivables have payment terms of 30 days or less. At the end of each reporting period, we assess the collectability of our receivables and estimate the expected credit losses using historical data, current market conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions and other data as deemed appropriate. Changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts balance were as follows: (In millions) March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Beginning balance as of January 1 $ 22 $ 11 Cumulative-effect adjustment 12 Current period provision (a) 2 22 Current period write offs ( 13 ) Recoveries of amounts previously reserved ( 10 ) Ending balance $ 24 $ 22 (a) As of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the current period provision consisted of $ 1 million and $ 10 million in joint interest receivables, respectively, and $ 1 million and $ 12 million in trade receivables, respectively. 8. Inventories Crude oil and natural gas are recorded at weighted average cost and carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Supplies and other items consist principally of tubular goods and equipment which are valued at weighted average cost and reviewed periodically for obsolescence or impairment when market conditions indicate. (In millions) March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Crude oil and natural gas $ 13 $ 10 Supplies and other items 65 66 Inventories $ 78 $ 76 11 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 9. Property, Plant and Equipment (In millions) March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 United States $ 14,853 $ 15,156 International 396 414 Corporate 64 68 Net property, plant and equipment $ 15,313 $ 15,638 As of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, we had $ 145 million and $ 98 million , respectively, of e xploratory well costs capitalized greater than one year related to suspended wells. Management believes these wells exhibit sufficient quantities of hydrocarbons to justify potential development. The vast majority of the suspended wells require completion activities and installation of infrastructure in order to classify the reserves as proved. 10. Impairments The following table summarizes impairment charges of proved properties and goodwill and their corresponding fair values. Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 2020 (In millions) Fair Value Impairment Fair Value Impairment Long-lived assets held for use $ $ 1 $ $ 2 Goodwill $ $ $ $ 95 2020 Impairments included $ 95 million of goodwill impairment in the International reporting unit. See Note 13 for further information. 11. Asset Retirement Obligations Asset retirement obligations primarily consist of estimated costs to remove, dismantle and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations. Changes in asset retirement obligations were as follows: Three Months Ended March 31, (In millions) 2021 2020 Beginning balance as of January 1 $ 254 $ 254 Incurred liabilities, including acquisitions 4 1 Settled liabilities, including dispositions ( 1 ) ( 2 ) Accretion expense (included in depreciation, depletion and amortization) 3 3 Revisions of estimates 2 ( 9 ) Ending balance as of March 31 (a) $ 262 $ 247 (a) Ending balances include $ 11 million classified as short-term at March 31, 2021 and 2020. 12. Leases We enter into various lease agreements to support our operations including drilling rigs, well fracturing equipment, compressors, buildings, aircraft, vessels, vehicles and miscellaneous field equipment. We primarily act as a lessee in these transactions and the majority of our existing leases are classified as either short-term or long-term operating leases. 12 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Supplemental balance sheet information related to leases was as follows: (In millions) March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Operating Leases: Balance Sheet Location: Right-of-use asset Other noncurrent assets $ 112 $ 133 Current portion of long-term lease liability Other current liabilities $ 62 $ 70 Long-term lease liability Deferred credits and other liabilities $ 58 $ 67 Our wholly owned subsidiary, Marathon E.G. Production Limited, is a lessor for residential housing in Equatorial Guinea, which is occupied by EGHoldings, a related party equity method investee see Note 22 . The lease was classified as an operating lease and expires in 2024, with a lessee option to extend through 2034. Lease payments are fixed for the entire duration of the agreement at approximately $ 6 million per year. Our lease income is reported in other income in our consolidated statements of income for all periods presented. The undiscounted cash flows to be received under this lease agreement are summarized below. (In millions) Operating Lease Future Cash Receipts 2021 $ 5 2022 6 2023 6 2024 6 2025 6 Thereafter 54 Total undiscounted cash flows $ 83 In 2018, we signed an agreement with an owner/lessor to construct and lease a new build-to-suit office building in Houston, Texas . The lessor and other participants are providing financing for up to $ 340 million to fund the estimated project costs. As of March 31, 2021, project costs incurred totaled approximately $ 182 million, including land acquisition and construction costs. The initial lease term is five years and will commence once construction is substantially complete and the new Houston office is ready for occupancy, which is expected to occur in the second half of 2021. At the end of the initial lease term, we can negotiate to extend the lease term for an additional five years , subject to the approval of the participants; purchase the property subject to certain terms and conditions; or remarket the property to an unrelated third party. The lease contains a residual value guarantee of approximately 89 % of the total acquisition and construction costs. 13. Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or between annual tests when events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill may have been reduced below its carrying value. During the first quarter of 2020, a global pandemic caused a substantial deterioration in the worldwide demand of hydrocarbons. The commensurate decline in our market capitalization indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the International reporting unit was less than its carrying value. We estimated the fair value of our International reporting unit using a combination of market and income approaches. The market approach referenced observable inputs specific to us and our industry, such as the price of our common equity, our enterprise value and valuation multiples of us and peers from the investor analyst community. The income approach utilized discounted cash flows, which were based on forecasted assumptions. These valuation methodologies represent Level 3 fair value measurements. Based on the results, we concluded our goodwill was fully impaired, and recorded an impairment of $ 95 million in the consolidated statements of income for the first quarter of 2020. This represented the entirety of our goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet. 13 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 14. Derivatives For further information regarding the fair value measurement of derivative instruments, see Note 15 . All of our commodity derivatives are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements under which we report net amounts. The following tables present the gross fair values of derivative instruments and the reported net amounts along with where they appear on the consolidated balance sheets.

These derivatives consist of three-way collars, two-way collars, fixed price swaps, basis swaps, and NYMEX roll basis swaps. Three-way collars consist of a sold call (ceiling), a purchased put (floor) and a sold put. The ceiling price is the maximum we will receive for the contract volumes; the floor is the minimum price we will receive, unless the market price falls below the sold put strike price. In this case, we receive the NYMEX WTI price plus the difference between the floor and the sold put price. Two-way collars only consist of a sold call (ceiling) and a purchased put (floor). 14 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) The following table sets forth outstanding derivative contracts as of March 31, 2021, and the weighted average prices for those contracts: 2021 Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Crude Oil NYMEX WTI Three-Way Collars Volume (Bbls/day) 40,000 20,000 10,000 Weighted average price per Bbl: Ceiling $ 61.45 $ 68.41 $ 71.64 Floor $ 39.75 $ 47.50 $ 50.00 Sold put $ 29.75 $ 37.50 $ 40.00 NYMEX WTI Two-Way Collars Volume (Bbls/day) 50,000 30,000 30,000 Weighted average price per Bbl: Ceiling $ 52.98 $ 51.54 $ 51.54 Floor $ 35.80 $ 35.67 $ 35.67 Basis Swaps - NYMEX WTI / UHC (a) Volume (Bbls/day) 15,000 Weighted average price per Bbl $ ( 1.80 ) $ $ NYMEX Roll Basis Swaps Volume (Bbls/day) 50,000 Weighted average price per Bbl $ ( 0.13 ) $ $ Natural Gas Henry Hub ( HH ) Two-Way Collars Volume (MMBtu/day) 200,000 200,000 200,000 Weighted average price per MMBtu: Ceiling $ 3.05 $ 3.05 $ 3.05 Floor $ 2.50 $ 2.50 $ 2.50 Henry Hub ( HH ) Fixed Price Swaps Volume (MMBtu/day) 50,000 50,000 50,000 Weighted average price per MMBtu $ 2.88 $ 2.88 $ 2.88 NGL Fixed Price Propane Swaps (b) Volume (Bbls/day) 5,000 5,000 5,000 Weighted average price per Bbl $ 23.19 $ 23.19 $ 23.19 (a) The basis differential price is indexed against U.S. Sweet Clearbrook ( UHC ) and NYMEX WTI.

Three Months Ended March 31, (In millions) 2021 2020 Unrealized gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net $ ( 82 ) $ 171 Realized gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net (a) $ ( 71 ) $ 31 (a) During the first quarter of 2021, net cash paid for settled derivative positions was $ 11 million. During the first quarter of 2020, net cash received for settled derivative positions was $ 13 million. Interest Rate Swaps During 2020, we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps to hedge the variations in cash flows related to fluctuations in the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) benchmark interest rate related to forecasted interest payments of a future d ebt issuance in 2022. Each respective derivative contract can be tied to an anticipated underlying dollar notional amount. During the third quarter of 2020, we de-designated these forward starting interest rate swaps previously designated as cash flow hedges. In the first quarter of 2021, the net deferred loss of $ 2 million in accumulated other comprehensive income related to these de-designated forward starting interest rate swaps was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings as an adjustment to net interest, as we fully redeemed the remainder of our outstanding 2022 notes in April 2021. Additionally, we recorded a $ 41 million mark-to-market gain within Net interest and other to reflect the change in value of these interest rate swaps during the first quarter 2021. The following table presents, by maturity date, information about our de-designated forward starting interest rate swap agreements, including the rate. March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Maturity Date Aggregate Notional Amount (in millions) Weighted Average, LIBOR Aggregate Notional Amount (in millions) Weighted Average, LIBOR November 1, 2022 $ 500 0.99 % $ 500 0.99 % Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow Hedges During 2020, we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $ 350 million to hedge variations in cash flows arising from fluctuations in the LIBOR benchmark interest rate related to forecasted interest payments of a future debt issuance in 2025. We expect to refinance these debt maturities in 2025. The swaps will terminate on or prior to the refinancing of the debt and the final value will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings with each future interest payment. During 2019, we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $ 320 million to hedge variations in cash flows related to the 1-month LIBOR component of future lease payments of our future Houston office. These swaps will settle monthly on the same day the lease payment is made with the first swap settlement occurring in January 2022. We expect the first lease payment to commence sometime in the period from December 2021 to May 2022. The last swap will mature in September 2026. As of March 31, 2021, amounts expected to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income over the next twelve months were not material. See Note 12 for further details regarding the lease of the new Houston office. The following table presents, by maturity date, information about our interest rate swap agreements, including the weighted average LIBOR-based, fixed rate.

See Note 14 . Commodity derivatives include three-way collars, two-way collars, fixed price swaps, basis swaps and NYMEX roll basis swaps. These instruments are measured at fair value using either a Black-Scholes or a modified Black-Scholes Model. For swaps, inputs to the models include only commodity prices and interest rates and are categorized as Level 1 because all assumptions and inputs are observable in active markets throughout the term of the instruments. For three-way collars and two-way collars, inputs to the models include commodity prices and implied volatility and are categorized as Level 2 because predominantly all assumptions and inputs are observable in active markets throughout the term of the instruments. The forward starting interest rate swaps are measured at fair value with a market approach using actionable broker quotes, which are Level 2 inputs. See Note 14 for detail on the forward starting interest rate swaps. Fair Value Estimates Goodwill See Note 13 for detail information relating to goodwill. Fair Values Nonrecurring See Note 10 for detail on our fair values related to impairments. Fair Values Financial Instruments Our current assets and liabilities include financial instruments, the most significant of which are receivables, the current portion of our long-term debt and payables. We believe the carrying values of our receivables and payables approximate fair value. Our fair value assessment incorporates a variety of considerations, including (1) the short-term duration of the 17 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) instruments, (2) our credit rating and (3) our historical incurrence of and expected future insignificant bad debt expense, which includes an evaluation of counterparty credit risk. The following table summarizes financial instruments, excluding receivables, payables and derivative financial instruments, and their reported fair values by individual balance sheet line item at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 (In millions) Fair Value Carrying Amount Fair Value Carrying Amount Financial assets Current assets $ 4 $ 4 $ 4 $ 4 Other noncurrent assets 23 37 24 37 Total financial assets $ 27 $ 41 $ 28 $ 41 Financial liabilities Current liabilities $ 76 $ 109 $ 72 $ 103 Long-term debt, including current portion (a) 6,035 5,431 6,077 5,431 Deferred credits and other liabilities 105 72 103 76 Total financial liabilities $ 6,216 $ 5,612 $ 6,252 $ 5,610 (a) Excludes debt issuance costs. Fair values of our financial assets included in other noncurrent assets, and of our financial liabilities included in other current liabilities and deferred credits and other liabilities, are measured using an income approach and most inputs are internally generated, which results in a Level 3 classification. Estimated future cash flows are discounted using a rate deemed appropriate to obtain the fair value. All of our long-term debt instruments are publicly traded. A market approach, based upon quotes from major financial institutions, which are Level 2 inputs, is used to measure the fair value of our debt. 16. Debt Revolving Credit Facility As of March 31, 2021, we had no borrowings against our $ 3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility ( Credit Facility ), as described below. The Credit Facility includes a covenant requiring our total debt to total capitalization ratio not to exceed 65 % as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. In the event of a default, the lenders holding more than half of the commitments may terminate the commitments under the Credit Facility and require the immediate repayment of all outstanding borrowings and the cash collateralization of all outstanding letters of credit under the Credit Facility. As of March 31, 2021, we were in compliance with this covenant with a ratio of 26 %. Debt Redemption On March 30, 2021, we sent an irrevocable notice of redemption to the trustee to fully redeem our outstanding $ 500 million 2.8 % Senior Notes due 2022 ( 2022 Notes ). As such, the balance was reclassified to current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2021. The 2022 Notes were redeemed subsequent to the first quarter on April 29, 2021. Long-term debt At March 31, 2021, we had $ 4.9 billion of total long-term debt outstanding. Our next significant long-term debt maturity is in the amount of $ 900 million due June 2025. Refer to our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a listing of our long-term debt maturities. 18 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 17. Stockholders Equity No share repurchases were made under our share repurchases program during the three months ended March 31, 2021; however, we repurchased $ 9 million of shares during the first quarter related to our tax withholding obligation associated with the vesting of employee restricted stock awards. The total remaining share repurchase authorization was $ 1.3 billion at March 31, 2021. Purchases under the program are made at our discretion and may be in either open market transactions, including block purchases, or in privately negotiated transactions using cash on hand, cash generated from operations, or proceeds from potential asset sales. This program may be changed based upon our financial condition or changes in market conditions and is subject to termination prior to completion. 18. Incentive Based Compensation Stock options, restricted stock awards and restricted stock units The following table presents a summary of activity for the first three months of 2021: Stock Options Restricted Stock Awards & Units Number of Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price Awards Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Outstanding at December 31, 2020 6,014,255 $ 21.00 7,851,754 $ 11.72 Granted $ 2,296,019 $ 11.20 Exercised/Vested ( 78,667 ) $ 7.43 ( 2,873,107 ) $ 12.54 Canceled (a) ( 532,945 ) $ 17.68 ( 785,182 ) $ 12.00 Outstanding at March 31, 2021 5,402,643 $ 21.53 6,489,484 $ 11.14 (a) Included in canceled are forfeitures related to workforce reductions. Stock-based performance unit awards During the first quarter of 2021, we granted stock-based performance unit awards as generally described in our 2020 Form 10-K, but with the addition of two indices to the peer group for these 2021 grants. During the first quarter of 2021, we also granted an additional type of stock-based performance unit award to eligible officers under the Marathon Oil Corporation 2019 Incentive Compensation Plan. At the grant date for these new stock-based performance units, each unit represents the value of one share of our common stock. These units are settled in cash, and the amount to be paid is generally based on the product of the number of units granted, the vesting percentage, and the average daily closing price of our common stock during the final 30 calendar days ending on the last trading day of the performance period. The vesting percentage can range from zero to 200 %, which is based on performance achieved over a two-year performance period and as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The performance metric is a predetermined amount of cumulative free cash flow, as defined by the award agreement, generated by the Company over the performance period. The units have a banking feature whereby the stock price valuation and vesting percentage are generally locked in at 50 % and then again at 100 %, if achieved during the performance period. Once those milestones are reached, the vesting percentage will not fall below those banked percentage amounts even if cumulative free cash flow subsequently declines during the performance period. Also, dividend equivalents may accrue generally during the performance period and would be paid in cash following the end of the performance period based on the amount of dividends credited over the performance period on shares of our common stock that represent the value of the units granted multiplied by the number of units that vest. During the first three months of 2021, we granted the following: 307,473 stock-based performance units to certain officers to be settled in shares. The grant date fair value per unit was $ 18.07 , as calculated using a Monte Carlo valuation model. 307,473 stock-based performance units to certain officers to be settled in cash. The grant date fair value per unit was $ 21.36 , as calculated by multiplying an estimated vesting percentage at grant by our common stock closing stock price on the grant date. 19 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 19.

(b) Net periodic benefit costs (credits) reflects a calculated market-related value of plan assets which recognizes changes in fair value over three years. During the first three months of 2021, we made contributions of $ 7 million to our funded pension plan. During the first three months of 2021, we also made a payment of $ 2 million related to other postretirement benefit plans. We currently expect to contribute an additional $ 26 million in contributions to our funded pension plan this year. However, as part of the American Rescue Plan Act passed by Congress and signed into law in March 2021, our funded pension plan is eligible for pension funding relief. As a result of the relief, required contributions could be lower than current projections, which might result in contributions to the plan this year that are lower than the current expected amount. 20. Reclassifications Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) The following table presents a summary of amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss): Three Months Ended March 31, (In millions) 2021 2020 Income Statement Line Postretirement and postemployment plans Amortization of prior service credit $ 6 $ 6 Other net periodic benefit costs Amortization of actuarial loss ( 3 ) ( 3 ) Other net periodic benefit costs Net settlement loss ( 2 ) Other net periodic benefit costs Interest rate swaps Reclassification of de-designated forward interest rate swaps ( 2 ) Net interest and other Total reclassifications to expense, net of tax (a) $ 1 $ 1 Net income (loss) (a) During 2021 and 2020 we had a full valuation allowance on net federal deferred tax assets in the U.S. and as such, there is no tax impact to our postretirement and postemployment plans. 20 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 21.

Equity Method Investments During the periods ended March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 our equity method investees were considered related parties and are summarized in the following table: (In millions) Ownership as of March 31, 2021 March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 EGHoldings (a) 60 % $ 119 $ 113 Alba Plant LLC (b) 52 % 182 168 AMPCO (c) 45 % 159 166 Total $ 460 $ 447 (a) EGHoldings is engaged in LNG production activity. (b) Alba Plant LLC processes LPG. (c) AMPCO is engaged in methanol production activity. Summarized financial information for equity method investees is as follows: Three Months Ended March 31, (In millions) 2021 2020 Income data: Revenues and other income $ 235 $ 172 Income (loss) from operations 96 ( 30 ) Net income (loss) $ 72 $ ( 26 ) Revenues from related parties were $ 8 million and $ 10 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, with the majority related to EGHoldings in all periods. Current receivables from related parties at March 31, 2021 were $ 18 million with the majority related to EGHoldings and $ 24 million at December 31, 2020 with the majority related to EGHoldings. Payables to related parties at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 were $ 14 million and $ 13 million, respectively, with the majority related to Alba Plant LLC in both periods. 23. Commitments and Contingencies In the second quarter of 2019, Marathon E.G. Production Limited ( MEGPL ), a consolidated and wholly owned subsidiary, signed a series of agreements to process third-party Alen Unit gas through existing infrastructure located in Punta Europa, E.G. Our equity method investee, Alba Plant LLC, is also a party to some of the agreements. These agreements contain clauses that require MEGPL to indemnify the owners of the Alen Unit against injury to Alba Plant LLC personnel and damage to or loss of Alba Plant LLC automobiles, as well as third party claims caused by Alba Plant and certain 21 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) environmental liabilities arising from certain hydrocarbons in the custody of Alba Plant LLC. Pursuant to these agreements, MEGPL agreed to indemnify third party property or events, including environmental liabilities, injury to Alba Plant LLC personnel and damage to or loss of Alba Plant LLC automobiles. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate this obligation as we do not have any history of prior indemnification claims or environmental discharge or contamination. Therefore, we have not recorded a liability with respect to these indemnities since the amount of potential future payments under these indemnification clauses is not determinable. The agreements to process the third-party Alen Unit gas required the execution of third-party guarantees by Marathon Oil Corporation in favor of the Alen Unit owners. Two separate guarantees were executed during the second quarter of 2020; one for a maximum of $ 91 million pertaining to the payment obligations of Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A. and another for a maximum of $ 25 million pertaining to the payment obligations of Alba Plant LLC. Payment by us would be required if either of those entities fails to honor its payment obligations pursuant to the relevant agreements with the owners of the Alen Unit. Certain owners of the Alen Unit, or their affiliates, are also direct or indirect shareholders in Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A. and Alba Plant LLC. Each guarantee expires no later than December 31, 2027. We measured these guarantees at fair value using the net present value of premium payments we expect to receive from our investees. Our liability for these guarantees was $ 4 million as of March 31, 2021, with a corresponding receivable from our investees. Each of Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A. and Equatorial Guinea LNG Train 1, S.A. provided us with a pledge of its receivables as recourse against any payments we may make under the guaranty of Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A. performance. Various groups, including the State of North Dakota and three Indian tribes represented by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, have been involved in a dispute regarding the ownership of certain lands underlying the Missouri River and Little Missouri River. As a result, as of March 31, 2021, we have a $ 114 million current liability in suspended royalty and working interest revenue, including interest, of which $ 104 million was included within accounts payable and $ 10 million related to accrued interest and was included within other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, we have a long-term receivable of $ 23 million for capital and expenses. In January 2020, we received a Notice of Violation from the EPA related to the Clean Air Act. The enforcement action will likely result in monetary sanctions and corrective actions yet-to-be specified and while the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe these enforcement actions will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are a defendant in a number of legal and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business including, but not limited to, royalty claims, contract claims, tax disputes and environmental claims. While the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, we may also be subject to retained liabilities with respect to certain divested assets by operation of law. For example, declines in commodity prices have created an environment where there is an increased risk that owners and/or operators of assets purchased from us may no longer be able to satisfy plugging or abandonment obligations that attach to those assets. In that event, due to operation of law, we may be required to assume plugging or abandonment obligations for those assets. Although we have established reserves for any such liabilities, we could be required to accrue additional amounts in the future and these amounts could be material. We have incurred and will continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately offset by the prices we receive for our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes. These laws generally provide for control of pollutants released into the environment and require responsible parties to undertake remediation of hazardous waste disposal sites. Penalties may be imposed for noncompliance. At March 31, 2021, accrued liabilities for remediation were not material. It is not presently possible to estimate the ultimate amount of all remediation cost that might be incurred or the penalties that may be imposed. 22 Item 2. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Overview Outlook Operations Market Conditions Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted Cash Flows Liquidity and Capital Resources Environmental Matters and Other Contingencies The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the preceding consolidated financial statements and notes in Item 1 . Executive Overview We are an independent exploration and production company based in Houston, Texas. Our strategy is to deliver competitive and improving corporate level returns by focusing our capital investment in our lower cost, higher margin U.S. resource plays (Eagle Ford in Texas, Bakken in North Dakota, STACK and SCOOP in Oklahoma and Northern Delaware in New Mexico). Our reinvestment rate capital allocation framework prioritizes free cash flow generation across a wide range of commodity prices to make available significant cash flow for investor-friendly purposes, including return of capital to shareholders and balance sheet enhancement. Keeping our workforce safe, minimizing our environmental impact, strong corporate governance and protecting our balance sheet are foundational to the execution of our strategy. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we leveraged our emergency response protocols and business continuity plans to help manage our operations and workforce. Our workforce worked remotely for a significant period of time since the pandemic began. We implemented a process for a phased return of employees to the office last year and, during April 2021, the majority of our corporate workforce returned to the office. Working remotely did not significantly impact our ability to maintain operations, allowed our field offices to operate without any disruption and did not cause us to incur significant additional expenses. Key highlights include the following: Maintained focus on balance sheet and liquidity At the end of the first quarter 2021, we had approximately $4.1 billion of liquidity, comprised of an undrawn $3.0 billion revolving credit facility and $1.1 billion in cash. We remain investment grade at all three primary rating agencies, with Moody recently upgrading their rating outlook to stable. In the first quarter of 2021, we generated $622 million of cash provided by operating activities, which was more than sufficient to fund our additions to property, plant and equipment of $209 million and dividends of $23 million. Subsequent to the end of first quarter, we fully redeemed our $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.8% Senior Notes due 2022. The March 31, 2021 cash balance reflects an increase of approximately $383 million from year-end, primarily due to higher commodity price realizations. Our U.S. segment average realized prices for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas for the quarter were $55.38 per bbl, $23.94 per bbl and $6.31 per mcf, respectively. We continue to maintain capital discipline in the first quarter and are within our Capital Budget of $1.0 billion. Financial and operational results U.S. net sales volumes decreased by 19% to 275 mboed, including a 22% reduction in U.S. crude oil net sales volumes compared to the same quarter last year as a result of overall lower drilling and completion activities and natural decline. 23 Our net income per share was $0.12 in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to a net loss per share of $(0.06) in the same period last year. Included in our financial results for the current quarter: Revenues from contracts with customers increased $153 million compared to the same quarter last year. We experienced significant increases in realized prices for both crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas. These increased price realizations were partially offset by lower production. Net loss on commodity derivatives of $153 million, of which $71 million related to realized net losses and $82 million related to unrealized net losses, for the first quarter of 2021, as compared to a net gain of $202 million in 2020. Lower depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses of $148 million, primarily a result of lower production. Continued to maintain production expense rates consistent with fourth quarter 2020 levels which were reflective of lower operational activity and cost management efforts. Compensation and ESG Highlights and Initiatives CEO and Board of Director total compensation reduced by approximately 25% with Board compensation mix shifted more toward equity and CEO mix further aligned with broader industry norms (exclusive of temporary reductions announced in 2020). Short-term incentive scorecard for compensation updated to focus on safety, environmental performance, capital efficiency, capital discipline/free cash flow generation and financial/balance sheet strength. Added a 2021 GHG emissions intensity target to short-term incentive scorecard. Adopted a medium-term goal for GHG emissions intensity reduction by 2025. Continued Board of Director refreshment with two Directors added during the first quarter of 2021, reflecting commitment to refreshment, independence, and diversity. Outlook Capital Budget In February 2021, we announced a 2021 Capital Budget of $1.0 billion, which is effectively a maintenance Capital Budget. We expect this maintenance-level Capital Budget will allow us to keep total company oil production in 2021 consistent with our fourth quarter 2020 exit rate. Our 2021 Capital Budget is consistent with our capital allocation framework that prioritizes corporate returns and free cash flow generation over production growth. The 2021 Capital Budget is weighted towards the four U.S. resource plays with approximately 90% allocated to the Eagle Ford and Bakken. Operations The following table presents a summary of our sales volumes for each of our segments. Refer to the Results of Operations section for a price-volume analysis for each of the segments. Three Months Ended March 31, Net Sales Volumes 2021 2020 Increase (Decrease) United States (mboed) 275 338 (19) % International (mboed) 66 81 (19) % Total (mboed) 341 419 (19) % United States Net sales volumes in the segment were lower in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the first quarter of 2020 with lower capital investment resulting in fewer wells to sales, coupled with natural decline. The decrease in capital investment is a direct result of the demand contraction related to the global pandemic, and the associated effects on hydrocarbon prices. We continue to expect that our planned pace of drilling and completions activity during the remainder of the year will enable us to meet our 2021 production guidance as noted in the preceding Outlook section. 24 The following tables provide additional details regarding net sales volumes, sales mix and operational drilling activity for our significant operations within this segment: Three Months Ended March 31, Net Sales Volumes 2021 2020 Increase (Decrease) Equivalent Barrels (mboed) Eagle Ford 77 114 (32) % Bakken 112 110 2 % Oklahoma 53 73 (27) % Northern Delaware 25 29 (14) % Other United States 8 12 (33) % Total United States 275 338 (19) % Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 Sales Mix - U.S. Resource Plays Eagle Ford Bakken Oklahoma Northern Delaware Total Crude oil and condensate 65 % 69 % 23 % 59 % 58 % Natural gas liquids 15 % 17 % 31 % 18 % 19 % Natural gas 20 % 14 % 46 % 23 % 23 % Three Months Ended March 31, Drilling Activity - U.S. Resource Plays 2021 2020 Gross Operated Eagle Ford: Wells drilled to total depth 30 30 Wells brought to sales 25 38 Bakken: Wells drilled to total depth 22 24 Wells brought to sales 3 25 Oklahoma: Wells drilled to total depth 9 Wells brought to sales 13 Northern Delaware: Wells drilled to total depth 11 Wells brought to sales 6 Eagle Ford Our net sales volumes were 77 mboed in the first quarter of 2021, including oil sales of 50 mbbld and we brought 25 gross company-operated wells to sales. We averaged 3 rigs and 1 frac crew during the quarter. Bakken Our net sales volumes were 112 mboed, including 77 mbbld of oil sales and we brought 3 gross company-operated wells to sales. We averaged 3 rigs during the quarter. Improved gas capture efforts resulted in higher gas and NGL sales that offset the lower wells to sales. Oklahoma Our net sales volumes were 53 mboed, including 12 mbbld of oil sales. Northern Delaware Our net sales volumes were 25 mboed, including 15 mbbld of oil sales. 25 International Net sales volumes were lower in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020 primarily due to timing of E.G. liftings. The following table provides details regarding net sales volumes for our operations within this segment: Three Months Ended March 31, Net Sales Volumes 2021 2020 Increase (Decrease) Equivalent Barrels (mboed) Equatorial Guinea 66 81 (19) % Equity Method Investees LNG (mtd) 3,766 5,064 (26) % Methanol (mtd) 1,092 1,185 (8) % Condensate and LPG (boed) 10,730 10,638 1 % Equatorial Guinea Net sales volumes in the first quarter of 2021 were lower compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to timing of liftings. 26 Market Conditions Commodity prices are the most significant factor impacting our revenues, profitability, operating cash flows, the amount of capital we invest in our business, redemption of our debt, payment of dividends and funding of share repurchases. Beginning in December 2020 and continuing through the first three months of 2021, commodity prices increased due to rising oil demand as COVID-19 vaccination rates and global economic activity increased. This was also supported by ongoing petroleum supply limitations by OPEC. Extreme winter weather in February also put upward pressure on natural gas prices during the quarter. However, we continue to expect commodity price volatility as worldwide demand remains below pre-pandemic levels and the pace of global economic recovery remains uncertain. Refer to Ite m 1A. Risk Factors in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion on how declines in commodity prices could impact us. United States The following table presents our average price realizations and the related benchmarks for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas for the first quarter of 2021 and 2020.

(c) Inclusion of realized gains (losses) on natural gas derivative instruments would have a minimal impact on average price realizations for the periods presented. (d) Bloomberg Finance LLP: Y-grade Mix NGL of 55% ethane, 25% propane, 5% butane, 8% isobutane and 7% natural gasoline. Crude oil and condensate Price realizations may differ from benchmarks due to the quality and location of the product. Natural gas liquids The majority of our sales volumes are sold at reference to Mont Belvieu prices. Natural gas A significant portion of our volumes are sold at bid-week prices, or first-of-month indices relative to our producing areas. International The following table presents our average price realizations and the related benchmark for crude oil for the first quarter of 2021 and 2020. Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 2020 Increase (Decrease) Average Price Realizations Crude oil and condensate ( per bbl ) $ 44.13 $ 36.88 20 % Natural gas liquids ( per bbl ) 1.00 1.00 % Natural gas ( per mcf ) 0.24 0.24 % Benchmark Brent (Europe) crude oil ( per bbl ) (a) $ 60.82 $ 50.44 21 % (a) Average of monthly prices obtained from the United States Energy Information Agency website. 27 Equatorial Guinea Crude oil and condensate Alba field liquids production is primarily condensate and generally sold in relation to the Brent crude benchmark. Alba Plant LLC processes the rich hydrocarbon gas which is supplied by the Alba field under a fixed price long term contract. Alba Plant LLC extracts NGLs and secondary condensate which is then sold by Alba Plant LLC at market prices, with our share of the revenue reflected in income from equity method investments on the consolidated statements of income. Alba Plant LLC delivers the processed dry natural gas to the Alba field for distribution and sale to AMPCO and EG LNG. Natural gas liquids Wet gas is sold to Alba Plant LLC at a fixed-price term contract resulting in realized prices not tracking market price. Alba Plant LLC extracts and keeps NGLs, which are sold at market price, with our share of income from Alba Plant LLC being reflected in the income from equity method investments on the consolidated statements of income. Natural gas Dry natural gas, processed by Alba Plant LLC on behalf of the Alba field is sold by the Alba field to EG LNG and AMPCO at fixed-price long term contracts resulting in realized prices not tracking market price. We derive additional value from the equity investment in our downstream gas processing units EG LNG and AMPCO. EG LNG sells LNG on a market-based long-term contract and AMPCO markets methanol at market prices. Results of Operations Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 vs. Three Months Ended March 31, 2020 Revenues from contracts with customers are presented by segment in the table below: Three Months Ended March 31, (In millions) 2021 2020 Revenues from contracts with customers United States $ 1,132 $ 970 International 45 54 Segment revenues from contracts with customers $ 1,177 $ 1,024 Below is a price/volume analysis for each segment. Refer to the preceding Operations and Market Conditions sections for additional detail related to our net sales volumes and average price realizations.

We have multiple crude oil, natural gas and NGL derivative contracts that settle against various indices. We record commodity derivative gains/losses as the index pricing and forward curves change each period. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Income from equity method investments increased $56 million in first quarter of 2021 primarily due to AMPCO triennial turnaround in first quarter of 2020 coupled with higher price realizations in first quarter of 2021. 28 Production expenses decreased $39 million in the first quarter of 2021 versus the same period in 2020, primarily as a result of the U.S. segment lower operational costs and continued cost management, specifically staffing and contract labor. International segment production expense decreased due to lower contract services and timing of E.G. liftings. The following table provides production expense and production expense rates (expense per boe) for each segment: Three Months Ended March 31, ($ in millions; rate in $ per boe) 2021 2020 Increase (Decrease) 2021 2020 Increase (Decrease) Production Expense and Rate Expense Rate United States $ 111 $ 143 (22) % $ 4.46 $ 4.63 (4) % International $ 10 $ 17 (41) % $ 1.68 $ 2.35 (29) % Shipping, handling and other operating increased $8 million despite a 19% decline in production volumes. Winter Storm Uri caused a significant increase in our realized natural gas prices in the U.S. segment during the current quarter. As disclosed in our Form 10-K, certain of our processing arrangements with midstream entities are percentage-of-proceeds contracts. We classify the proceeds retained by the midstream companies as shipping and handling cost. The increase in shipping and handling costs of these percentage-of-proceeds contracts coincides with the increase in realized natural gas prices. Impairments decreased $96 million. In the first quarter of 2020, we recognized an impairment of goodwill related to our International reporting unit. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for more detail. Exploration expenses include unproved property impairments, dry well costs, geological and geophysical, and other costs. The following table summarizes the components of exploration expenses: Three Months Ended March 31, (In millions) 2021 2020 Increase (Decrease) Exploration Expenses Unproved property impairments $ 15 $ 22 (32) % Dry well costs 2 % Geological and geophysical 2 1 100 % Other 2 5 (60) % Total exploration expenses $ 21 $ 28 (25) % Depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased $148 million in the first quarter of 2021 as a result of lower sales volumes in our U.S. and International segments. Our segments apply the units-of-production method to the majority of their assets, including capitalized asset retirement costs; therefore volumes have an impact on DD&A expense. The DD&A rate (expense per boe) is impacted by field-level changes in reserves, capitalized costs and sales volume mix between fields. The following table provides DD&A expense and DD&A expense rates for each segment: Three Months Ended March 31, ($ in millions; rate in $ per boe) 2021 2020 Increase (Decrease) 2021 2020 Increase (Decrease) DD&A Expense and Rate Expense Rate United States $ 472 $ 617 (24) % $ 19.05 $ 20.03 (5) % International $ 19 $ 21 (10) % $ 3.09 $ 2.86 8 % General and administrative expenses increased $13 million in the first quarter of 2021. Included in the first quarter of 2021 are expenses of $13 million related to terminating an aircraft lease agreement and severance related expenses of $11 million. The severance expenses were partially offset by the realization of cost savings from the 2020 workforce reductions, which were reflected in lower general and administrative costs in each of our U.S. and International segments. Net interest and other decreased $51 million in the first quarter of 2021 versus the same period in 2020, primarily as a result of a $41 million mark-to-market gain on interest rate derivative contracts. The interest rate swaps were executed to hedge variations in cash flows related to interest rate fluctuations on our 2022 debt. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. 29 Segment Income Segment income represents income which excludes certain items not allocated to our operating segments, net of income taxes. A portion of our corporate and operations general and administrative support costs are not allocated to the operating segments. These unallocated costs primarily consist of employment costs (including pension effects), professional services, facilities and other costs associated with corporate and operations support activities. Additionally, items which affect comparability such as: gains or losses on dispositions, impairments of proved and certain unproved properties, goodwill and equity method investments, unrealized gains or losses on commodity and interest rate derivative instruments, effects of pension settlements and curtailments or other items (as determined by the CODM) are not allocated to operating segments. The following table reconciles segment income (loss) to net income (loss): Three Months Ended March 31, (In millions) 2021 2020 United States $ 212 $ (20) International 50 (1) Segment income (loss) 262 (21) Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes (165) (25) Net income (loss) $ 97 $ (46) United States segment income (loss) in the first quarter of 2021 was $212 million of income versus a $20 million loss for the same period in 2020. The increase in income was primarily due to higher price realizations and lower DD&A expense. These favorable changes were partially offset by lower sales volumes and a realized loss on commodity derivatives in the first quarter of 2021, whereas the prior quarter realized a gain on commodity derivatives. International segment income (loss) in the first quarter of 2021 was $50 million of income versus a $1 million loss for the same period in 2020. Income from equity method investments significantly increased as a result of higher price realizations and lower costs due to the first quarter 2020 turnaround at AMPCO facility. This was partially offset by lower production volumes in E.G. in the first quarter of 2021. Critical Accounting Estimates There have been no material changes or developments in the evaluation of the accounting estimates and the underlying assumptions or methodologies pertaining to our Critical Accounting Estimates disclosed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. 30 Cash Flows Commodity prices are the most significant factor impacting our revenues, profitability, operating cash flows, the amount of capital we invest in our business, payment of dividends, and funding of share repurchases. As commodity prices increased during the first three months of 2021, we generated positive cash flow from operations. We continue to expect volatility in commodity prices and that could impact how much cash flow from operations we generate. The following table presents sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents: Three Months Ended March 31, (In millions) 2021 2020 Sources of cash and cash equivalents Operating activities $ 622 $ 701 Disposal of assets, net of cash transferred to the buyer 3 3 Other 8 Total sources of cash and cash equivalents $ 625 $ 712 Uses of cash and cash equivalents Additions to property, plant and equipment $ (209) $ (620) Additions to other assets (1) Purchases of common stock (9) (92) Dividends paid (23) (40) Other (1) Total uses of cash and cash equivalents $ (242) $ (753) Cash flows generated from operating activities in the first three months of 2021 were 11% lower compared to the same period in 2020, primarily as a result of lower production volumes, a net loss on realized commodity derivatives (as compared to a gain in the prior quarter), and lower cash flows from working capital. These were partially offset by higher realized commodity prices. The following table shows capital expenditures by segment and reconciles to additions to property, plant and equipment as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows: Three Months Ended March 31, (In millions) 2021 2020 United States $ 183 $ 561 International Corporate 1 7 Total capital expenditures 184 568 Change in capital expenditure accrual 25 52 Total use of cash and cash equivalents for property, plant and equipment $ 209 $ 620 The decline in our capital expenditures for the U.S. segment in the first three months of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, was caused by lower drilling and completions activities across all four of our shale basins. Liquidity and Capital Resources Available Liquidity Our main sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, internally generated cash flow from operations, sales of non-core assets, capital market transactions and our revolving Credit Facility. At March 31, 2021, we had approximately $4.1 billion of liquidity consisting of $1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $3.0 billion available under our revolving Credit Facility. 31 Our working capital requirements are supported by our cash and cash equivalents and our Credit Facility. We may draw on our revolving Credit Facility to meet short-term cash requirements, or issue debt or equity securities through the shelf registration statement discussed below as part of our longer-term liquidity and capital management program. Because of the alternatives available to us as discussed above, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity are adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements including our capital spending programs, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies. General economic conditions, commodity prices, and financial, business and other factors, including the global pandemic, could affect our operations and our ability to access the capital markets. We continue to be rated investment grade at all three primary credit rating agencies. A downgrade in our credit ratings could increase our future cost of financing or limit our ability to access capital and could result in additional credit support requirements. We do not have any triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an event of default in the case of a downgrade of our credit ratings. See Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for a discussion of how a downgrade in our credit ratings could affect us. On April 29, 2021, our Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.04 per share payable June 10, 2021 to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 19, 2021. Capital Resources Credit Arrangements and Borrowings At March 31, 2021, we had no borrowings against our Credit Facility and $4.9 billion of total long-term debt outstanding. In March 2021, we announced our intention to fully redeem our outstanding $500 million 2.8% Senior Notes due 2022. The redemption settled on April 29, 2021 and the redemption will reduce annual cash interest expense by $14 million. O ur next significant debt maturity will be the $900 million 3.85% Senior Notes due June 2025. Refer to our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a listing of our long-term debt maturities. In 2018, we signed an agreement with an owner/lessor to construct and lease a new build-to-suit office building in Houston, Texas . The lessor and other participants are providing financing for up to $340 million to fund the estimated project costs. As of March 31, 2021, project costs incurred totaled approximately $182 million, including land acquisition and construction costs. Shelf Registration We have a universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer for purposes of SEC rules, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities. Debt-To-Capital Ratio The Credit Facility includes a covenant requiring that our total debt to total capitalization ratio not exceed 65% as of the last day of the fiscal quarter. Our ratio was 26% at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Capital Requirements Share Repurchase Program No share repurchases were made under our share repurchases program during the three months ended March 31, 2021; however, we repurchased $9 million of shares during the first quarter related to our tax withholding obligation associated with the vesting of employee restricted stock awards. Our share repurchase program has $1.3 billion of remaining authorization. Contractual Cash Obligations As of March 31, 2021, there are no material changes to our consolidated cash obligations to make future payments under existing contracts, as disclosed in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 32 Environmental Matters and Other Contingencies We have incurred and will continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately offset by the prices we receive for our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes. These laws generally provide for control of pollutants released into the environment and require responsible parties to undertake remediation of hazardous waste disposal sites. Penalties may be imposed for noncompliance. Other than the items set forth in Item 1. Legal Proceedings, there have been no significant changes to the environmental, health and safety matters under Item 1. Business or Item 3. Legal Proceedings in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of other contingencies. 33 Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ).
