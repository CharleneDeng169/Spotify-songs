Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and the other financial information found elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The following discussion includes forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties. See "Disclosures Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" (immediately prior to Part I) and Item 1A. Risk Factors. Each of our segments is organized and managed based upon both geographic location and the nature of the products and services it offers: North America E&P explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas in North America; International E&P explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas outside of North America and produces and markets products manufactured from natural gas, such as LNG and methanol, in E.G.; and Oil Sands Mining mines, extracts and transports bitumen from oil sands deposits in Alberta, Canada, and upgrades the bitumen to produce and market synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil. Executive Summary Marathon Oil delivered against 2014 performance commitments by increasing production by 35 percent in the three core U.S. resource plays. We added 305 mmboe of net proved reserves during the year, of which 296 mmboe were in our North America E&P segment. We executed two strategic dispositions for aggregate cash proceeds of more than $4 billion, closing the sale of our Angola assets in the first quarter and our Norway business in the fourth quarter. We executed share repurchases in the first half of the year worth $1 billion. We ended 2014 with liquidity of $4.9 billion comprised of $2.4 billion of cash and $2.5 billion available through a committed multi-year credit facility. Although commodity prices began a substantial decline in the second half of 2014 which continued into 2015, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to satisfy operational objectives and capital commitments with the cash and cash equivalents on hand, internally generated cash flow from operations and available borrowing capacity. Significant 2014 operating and financial activities include the following: Production from continuing operations, excluding Libya, up 8 percent over last year North America E&P net sales volumes averaged 238 mboed, an 18 percent increase over last year Production from our U.S. resource plays averaged 181 mboed, a 35 percent increase over last year Eagle Ford averaged net sales volumes of 112 mboed, a 38 percent increase Bakken averaged net sales volumes of 51 mboed, a 31 percent increase Oklahoma Resource Basins averaged net sales volumes of 18 mboed, a 29 percent increase Total net proved reserves related to continuing operations increased 6 percent to approximately 2.2 bboe Recorded 97 percent average operational availability for our operated assets Announced Jisik-1 exploration discovery on the operated Harir Block in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq Closed Norway and Angola sales for aggregate cash proceeds of more than $4 billion Repurchased 29 million common shares for $1 billion Increased quarterly dividend by 11 percent to 21 cents per share in the second quarter Increased income from continuing operations per diluted share to $1.42 compared to $1.31 in 2013, by 8 percent 36 Market Conditions Prevailing prices for the crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil that we produce significantly impact our revenues and cash flows. Beginning in the second half of 2014, the crude oil benchmark prices began to decline and this decline continued into early 2015. Crude oil benchmark prices are likely to remain volatile based on global supply and demand and could decline further. In addition, the Henry Hub natural gas benchmark began to decline in late 2014 and continued its decline into 2015. Because both WTI crude oil and Brent crude oil benchmark prices were greater than $90 per barrel for the first nine months of 2014, and the Henry Hub natural gas price decline began in late 2014, the magnitude of these commodity declines is not fully evident in the tables below that report 2014 annual price realizations averages relative to our operating segments. See Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, Cash Flows and Liquidity Critical Accounting Estimates for further discussion of how a substantial extended decline in commodity price changes could impact us. North America E&P The following table presents our average price realizations and the related benchmarks for crude oil, NGLs and natural gas for 2014 , 2013 and 2012 : 2014 2013 2012 Average Price Realizations (a) Crude Oil and Condensate (per bbl) Bakken $81.63 $90.25 $83.11 Eagle Ford 87.99 99.69 100.14 Oklahoma Resource Basins 87.15 94.84 89.26 Other North America (b) 84.21 90.42 91.75 Total Crude Oil and Condensate 85.25 94.19 91.30 Natural Gas Liquids (per bbl) Bakken $43.25 $41.60 $42.35 Eagle Ford 29.60 30.16 32.96 Oklahoma Resource Basins 32.61 35.28 31.82 Other North America (b) 51.12 55.69 52.51 Total Natural Gas Liquids 33.42 35.12 39.57 Total Liquid Hydrocarbons (per bbl) (c) Bakken $79.41 $87.76 $81.36 Eagle Ford 75.83 84.95 88.09 Oklahoma Resource Basins 50.86 50.77 49.21 Other North America (b) 81.88 88.16 89.03 Total Liquid Hydrocarbons 77.02 85.20 85.80 Natural Gas (per mcf) Bakken $5.28 $3.90 $3.11 Eagle Ford 4.43 3.67 3.03 Oklahoma Resource Basins 4.49 3.78 3.05 Other North America (b) 4.65 3.95 4.20 Total Natural Gas 4.57 3.84 3.92 Benchmarks WTI crude oil average of daily prices (per bbl) $92.91 $98.05 $94.15 LLS crude oil average of daily prices (per bbl) (d) 96.64 107.36 111.71 Mont Belvieu NGLs (per bbl) (e) 32.52 33.78 38.59 Henry Hub natural gas settlement date average (per mmbtu) 4.42 3.65 2.79 (a) Excludes gains or losses on derivative instruments.

(e) Bloomberg Finance LLP: Y-grade Mix NGL of 50% ethane, 25% propane, 10% butane, 5% isobutane and 10% natural gasoline. Crude oil and condensate Our crude oil and condensate price realizations may differ from the benchmark due to the quality and location of the product. Crude oil benchmark prices decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 . This price decline continued into 2015 with WTI crude oil and LLS crude oil averaging $47.33 and $48.82 per bbl in January 2015. 37 Natural gas liquids The majority of our NGL volumes are sold at reference to Mont Belvieu prices. Average Mount Belvieu NGL prices for 2014 were modestly lower than for 2013. Our net NGL sales volumes continue to grow due to development of our U.S. resource plays, increasing 164 percent from 2012 to 2014. Natural gas A significant portion of our natural gas production in the U.S. is sold at bid-week prices, or first-of-month indices relative to our specific producing areas. Average Henry Hub natural gas settlement prices were higher in 2014 compared to 2013 . Henry Hub natural gas settlement prices averaged $3.19 per mmtbu for January 2015. International E&P The following table presents our average price realizations and the related benchmark for crude oil for 2014 , 2013 and 2012 : 2014 2013 2012 Average Price Realizations Crude Oil and Condensate (per bbl) Equatorial Guinea $81.01 $90.62 $92.56 United Kingdom 94.31 110.76 109.50 Libya 94.70 122.92 127.31 Total Crude Oil and Condensate 87.23 108.18 113.61 Natural Gas Liquids (per bbl) Equatorial Guinea (a) $1.00 $1.00 $1.00 United Kingdom (b) 67.73 72.14 78.81 Total Natural Gas Liquids 2.46 5.24 8.32 Total Liquid Hydrocarbons (per bbl) Equatorial Guinea $54.29 $60.34 $64.33 United Kingdom 93.75 108.92 107.31 Libya 94.70 122.92 127.31 Total Liquid Hydrocarbons 68.98 91.04 100.02 Natural Gas (per mcf) Equatorial Guinea (a) $0.24 $0.24 $0.24 United Kingdom 8.27 10.64 9.72 Libya 3.11 5.44 5.76 Total Natural Gas 0.72 1.15 1.33 Benchmark Brent (Europe) crude oil (per bbl) (c) $99.02 $108.64 $111.65 (a) Primarily represents fixed prices under long-term contracts with Alba Plant LLC, Atlantic Methanol Production Company LLC and Equatorial Guinea LNG Holdings Limited, which are equity method investees. We include our share of income from each of these equity method investees in our International E&P segment. (b) Related sales volumes one mbbld or less for all periods presented. (c) Average of monthly prices obtained from EIA website. Crude oil and condensate Our international crude oil and condensate production is generally sold in relation to the Brent crude oil benchmark. Crude oil benchmark prices decreased in 2014 compared to 2013. This price decline continued into 2015 with Brent crude oil averaging $47.86 per bbl in January 2015. Natural gas liquids and natural gas Our NGL and natural gas sales from E.G. are subject to fixed-price, term contracts, making realized prices in this area less volatile; therefore, our reported average natural gas realized prices for the International E&P segment will not fully track market price movements. Although natural gas prices in Europe tend to be considerably higher than in the U.S., these prices decreased in 2014 compared to 2013. 38 Oil Sands Mining The Oil Sands Mining segment produces and sells various qualities of synthetic crude oil. Output mix can be impacted by operational reliability or planned unit outages at the mines or upgrader. Sales prices for roughly two-thirds of the normal output mix have historically tracked movements in the WTI crude oil benchmark and one-third have historically tracked movements in the Canadian heavy crude oil benchmark, primarily WCS. Comparing 2014 and 2013, the WCS crude oil discount to WTI crude oil narrowed by $5.97 per barrel. A comparison of 2014 compared to 2013 indicate the WTI crude oil benchmark decreased while the WCS crude oil benchmark slightly increased. However, both WTI and WCS crude oil benchmarks declined in January 2015 with prices averaging $47.33 per bbl and $30.43 per bbl, respectively. The operating cost structure of our Oil Sands Mining operations is predominantly fixed and therefore many of the costs incurred in times of full operation continue during production downtime. Per-unit costs are sensitive to production rates. Key variable costs are natural gas and diesel fuel, which track commodity markets such as the Canadian Alberta Energy Company ("AECO") natural gas sales index and crude oil prices. As average price realizations are typically at a discount to WTI and the operating cost structure for Oil Sands Mining is predominately fixed, sustained declines in oil prices could result in operating losses. The following table presents our average price realizations and the related benchmarks that impacted both our revenues and variable costs for 2014 , 2013 and 2012 : 2014 2013 2012 Average Price Realizations Synthetic Crude Oil (per bbl) $83.35 $87.51 $81.72 Benchmark WTI crude oil (per bbl) $92.91 $98.05 $94.15 WCS crude oil (per bbl) (a) $73.60 $72.77 $73.18 AECO natural gas sales index (per mmbtu) (b) $3.99 $3.08 $2.39 (a) Average of monthly prices based upon average WTI adjusted for differentials unique to western Canada. (b) Monthly average AECO day ahead index. Net Sales Volumes Our net sales volumes from continuing operations averaged 415 mboed, 404 mboed and 389 mboed for 2014 , 2013 and 2012 . As liftings from Libya were sporadic during this 3-year period, a more representative comparison is net sales volumes from continuing operations excluding Libya, which was 408 mboed, 376 mboed and 344 mboed for 2014 , 2013 and 2012 . The continued ramp up of production from our U.S. resource plays has been the most significant contributor to the increases when comparing results excluding Libya, partially offset by decreases from domestic asset sales and normal production declines. Net sales volumes related to the Angola and Norway discontinued operations averaged 54 mboed, 89 mboed and 90 mboed for 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , representing 12 percent , 18 percent and 19 percent of total company net sales volumes in those periods. 39 The following table presents North America E&P segment net sales volumes by product and geographic area for 2014 , 2013 and 2012 : Year Ended December 31, Net Sales Volumes 2014 2013 2012 North America E&P Crude Oil and Condensate (mbbld) Bakken 45 35 27 Eagle Ford 72 51 23 Oklahoma Resource Basins 3 2 1 Other North America (a) 37 38 45 Total Crude Oil and Condensate 157 126 96 Natural Gas Liquids (mbbld) Bakken 3 2 1 Eagle Ford 19 14 5 Oklahoma Resource Basins 5 4 2 Other North America (a) 2 3 3 Total Natural Gas Liquids 29 23 11 Total Liquid Hydrocarbons (mbbld) Bakken 48 37 28 Eagle Ford 91 65 28 Oklahoma Resource Basins 8 6 3 Other North America (a) 39 41 48 Total Liquid Hydrocarbons 186 149 107 Natural Gas (mmcfd) Bakken 18 13 8 Eagle Ford 123 94 37 Oklahoma Resource Basins 61 48 32 Other North America (a) 108 157 281 Total Natural Gas 310 312 358 Equivalent Barrels (mboed) Bakken 51 39 29 Eagle Ford 112 81 34 Oklahoma Resource Basins 18 14 8 Other North America (a) 57 67 95 Total North America E&P (mboed) 238 201 166 (a) Includes Gulf of Mexico and other conventional onshore U.S. production, plus Alaska in 2013 and 2012. North America E&P segment average net sales volumes in 2014 increase d 18 percent when compared to 2013 . Net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes increase d 37 mbbld in 2014 primarily reflecting continued growth from our three core U.S. resource plays and net natural gas sales volumes decrease d 2 mmcfd in 2014 primarily due to the shut-in and exit from Powder River Basin operations and the January 2013 sale of our Alaska assets, partially offset by the increases from the U.S. resource plays. North America E&P segment average net sales volumes in 2013 increased 21 percent when compared to 2012 , primarily due to higher liquid hydrocarbon net sales volumes resulting from ongoing development programs in our three key U.S. resource plays, partially offset by lower natural gas sales volumes, primarily the result of the January 2013 sale of our Alaska assets. Refer to the Item 1. Business section for additional detail related to net sales volumes by asset. 40 The following table presents International E&P and OSM segments net sales volumes by product and geographic area for 2014 , 2013 and 2012 : Year Ended December 31, Net Sales Volumes 2014 2013 2012 International E&P Crude Oil and Condensate (mbbld) Equatorial Guinea 21 23 25 United Kingdom 11 14 15 Libya 7 24 42 Total Crude Oil and Condensate 39 61 82 Natural Gas Liquids (mbbld) Equatorial Guinea 10 11 11 United Kingdom 1 1 Total Natural Gas Liquids 10 12 12 Total Liquid Hydrocarbons (mbbld) Equatorial Guinea 31 34 36 United Kingdom 11 15 16 Libya 7 24 42 Total Liquid Hydrocarbons 49 73 94 Natural Gas (mmcfd) Equatorial Guinea 439 442 428 United Kingdom (b) 28 32 48 Libya 1 22 15 Total Natural Gas 468 496 491 Equivalent Barrels (mboed) Equatorial Guinea 104 107 107 United Kingdom (b) 16 20 24 Libya 7 28 45 Total International E&P (mboed) 127 155 176 Oil Sands Mining Synthetic Crude Oil (mbbld) (c) 50 48 47 Total Continuing Operations (mboed) 415 404 389 Discontinued Operations - Angola (mboed) (d) 2 10 Discontinued Operations - Norway (mboed) (d) 52 79 90 Total Company (mboed) 469 493 479 Net Sales Volumes of Equity Method Investees LNG (mtd) 6,535 6,548 6,290 Methanol (mtd) 1,092 1,249 1,298 (b) Includes natural gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale of 6 mmcfd, 7 mmcfd and 15 mmcfd for 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 . (c) Includes blendstocks. (d) As we closed the sale of our Angola assets and our Norway business during 2014, they are reflected as discontinued operations and excluded from segments in all periods presented. International E&P segment average net sales volumes in 2014 decrease d 18 percent when compared to 2013 . We had lower oil sales from Libya in 2014 as a result of third party labor strikes at the Es Sider terminal and ongoing civil unrest. Excluding Libya, net sales volumes decrease d 6 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 , primarily due to reliability issues and production decline in the U.K. and lower reliability at the non-operated methanol facility in E.G. International E&P segment average net sales volumes in 2013 decreased 12 percent when compared to 2012 primarily due to lower liquid hydrocarbon net sales volumes in Libya. Excluding Libya, net sales volumes only decreased 3 percent in 2013 when compared to 2012 . Refer to the Item 1. Business section for additional detail related to net sales volumes by asset. Oil Sands Mining Our OSM operations consist of a 20 percent non-operated working interest in the AOSP. Our net synthetic crude oil sales volumes were 50 mbbld in 2014 compared to 48 mbbld in 2013 and 47 mbbld in 2012 . 41 Consolidated Results of Operations: 2014 compared to 2013 Consolidated income from continuing operations after income taxes in 2014 was 4 percent higher than 2013 primarily due to increased net sales volumes in the North America E&P segment which were partially offset by lower average price realizations in all segments, as well as lower net sales volumes in the International E&P segment primarily as a result of civil unrest in Libya. Sales and other operating revenues, including related party are summarized by segment in the following table: Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2014 2013 Sales and other operating revenues, including related party North America E&P $ 5,770 $ 5,068 International E&P 1,410 2,654 Oil Sands Mining 1,556 1,576 Segment sales and other operating revenues, including related party 8,736 9,298 Unrealized loss on crude oil derivative instruments (52 ) Sales and other operating revenues, including related party $ 8,736 $ 9,246 North America E&P sales and other operating revenues increased $702 million from 2013 to 2014 primarily due to higher liquid hydrocarbon net sales volumes resulting from ongoing development programs in the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Oklahoma Resource Basins, partially offset by lower average crude oil price realizations. The following table displays changes in North America E&P segment sales and other operating revenues by product. Refer to the preceding Market Conditions and Net Sales Volumes sections for additional detail related to average price realizations and net sales.

This decrease was primarily due to lower average price realizations compared to 2013 , partially offset by increased net sales volumes in 2014. 42 The following table displays changes in OSM segment sales of synthetic crude oil and other operating revenues. Refer to the preceding Market Conditions and Net Sales Volumes sections for additional detail related to average price realizations and net sales. Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) Related to Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2013 Price Realizations Net Sales Volumes 2014 Oil Sands Mining Price-Volume Analysis Synthetic crude oil $ 1,542 $ (76 ) $ 59 $ 1,525 Other sales 34 31 Total $ 1,576 $ 1,556 Unrealized gains and losses on crude oil derivative instruments are included in total sales and other operating revenues but are not allocated to the segments. These crude oil derivative instruments, all of which expired December 2013, had no impact in 2014 compared to a net unrealized loss of $52 million in 2013 . See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for information about our derivative positions. Marketing revenues increased $31 million in 2014 from 2013 . The increase in 2014 is primarily due to higher marketing activity levels in both the North America E&P and OSM segments. Marketing activities include the purchase of commodities from third parties for resale, or in order to meet sales contracts, and serve to aggregate volumes in order to satisfy transportation commitments as well as to achieve flexibility within product types and delivery points. Because the volume of marketing activity is based on market dynamics, it can fluctuate from period to period. Net loss on disposal of assets in 2014 primarily includes the pretax loss on the sale of non-core acreage located in the far northwest portion of the Williston Basin. The net loss on disposal of assets in 2013 primarily included pretax losses on the sale of our DJ Basin interests and the conveyance of our Marcellus interests to the operator, offset by pretax gains on the sales of the Neptune gas plant and our remaining assets in Alaska. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for information about these dispositions. Production expenses increased $90 million in 2014 from 2013 primarily related to increased North America E&P net sales volumes in the Eagle Ford and Bakken. The production expense rate (expense per boe) decreased in North America E&P in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to improved operating efficiencies in the Eagle Ford. The expense per boe increased in the International E&P segment due to a subsea power project at our non-operated Foinaven field as well as a turnaround in Brae in the U.K. and a non-recurring riser repair in E.G. The following table provides production expense rates for each segment: ($ per boe) 2014 2013 North America E&P $10.25 $10.86 International E&P $8.31 $6.36 Oil Sands Mining (a) $44.53 $46.30 (a) Production expense per synthetic crude oil barrel (before royalties) includes production costs, shipping and handling, taxes other than income and insurance costs and excludes pre-development costs. Other operating expenses increased $73 million in 2014 from the prior year, primarily due to increased shipping and handling costs in North America in line with increased sales volumes, as well as the impact of a settlement related to the calculation of the net profits interest payments associated with our Alba Plant equity interests in E.G. Marketing expenses increased $29 million in 2014 from the prior year, consistent with the increase in marketing revenues discussed above. Exploration expenses decreased $98 million in 2014 from 2013 , primarily related to our North America E&P segment as a result of larger non-cash unproved property impairments during 2013 related to Eagle Ford leases that either expired or that we did not expect to drill. These decreases were partially offset by increases in 2014 expenses related to the operated Key Largo, the outside-operated Perseus, the outside-operated second Shenandoah appraisal well in the Gulf of Mexico and our operated Sodalita West #1 exploratory well in E.G. 43 The following table summarizes the components of exploration expenses: Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2014 2013 Unproved property impairments $ 306 $ 572 Dry well costs 317 148 Geological and geophysical 85 80 Other 85 91 Total exploration expenses $ 793 $ 891 Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $361 million in 2014 from the prior year. Our segments apply the units-of-production method to the majority of their assets, including capitalized asset retirement costs. Increased DD&A expense in 2014 is primarily due to higher North America E&P sales volumes as a result of ongoing development programs over our three U.S. resource plays. The DD&A rate, which is impacted by changes in reserves, capitalized costs and sales volume mix by field, can also cause changes to our DD&A. The following table provides DD&A rates for each segment: ($ per boe) 2014 2013 North America E&P $26.95 $26.23 International E&P $5.79 $5.86 Oil Sands Mining $12.07 $12.39 Impairments in 2014 included certain Gulf of Mexico properties. Impairments in 2013 primarily related to a second LNG production train in E.G., the Ozona development in the Gulf of Mexico, and our Powder River Basin asset in Wyoming. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for information about these impairments. Taxes other than income include production, severance and ad valorem taxes in the U.S., which tend to increase or decrease in relation to sales volumes and revenues, and increased $61 million in 2014 from 2013 , consistent with similar increases in the North America E&P segment. Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2014 2013 Production and severance $ 240 $ 202 Ad valorem 74 61 Other 92 82 Total $ 406 $ 345 Net interest and other decreased $40 million in 2014 from 2013 primarily due to an increase in capitalized interest and higher net foreign currency gains as well as a dividend received in 2014 from a mutual insurance company of which we are an owner. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed information. Provision for income taxes decreased $1,070 million in 2014 from 2013 primarily due to the decrease in pretax income from higher tax jurisdictions, primarily Libya. The following is an analysis of the effective tax rates for 2014 and 2013 . 2014 2013 Statutory rate applied to income from continuing operations before income taxes 35 % 35 % Effects of foreign operations, including foreign tax credits (6 ) 26 Change in permanent reinvestment assertion (19 ) Adjustments to valuation allowances 21 (1 ) Other (2 ) 1 Effective income tax rate on continuing operations 29 % 61 % The effective income tax rate is influenced by a variety of factors including the geographic and functional sources of income and the relative magnitude of these sources of income. The difference between the total provision and the sum of the amounts allocated to segments appears in the "Corporate and other unallocated items" shown in the reconciliation of segment income to net income below. 44 Effects of foreign operations The effects of foreign operations on our effective tax rate decreased in 2014 as compared to 2013 due to a shift in pretax income mix between high and low tax jurisdictions. This is primarily related to decreased sales in Libya where the tax rate is in excess of 90 percent . Excluding Libya, the effective tax rates on continuing operations for 2014 and 2013 would be 27 percent and 38 percent . Change in permanent reinvestment assertion In the second quarter of 2014, we reviewed our foreign operations, including the disposition of our Norway business, and concluded that our foreign operations do not have the same level of immediate capital needs as previously expected. Therefore, we no longer intend for previously unremitted foreign earnings associated with our U.K. operations to be permanently reinvested outside the U.S. The U.K. statutory tax rate is in excess of the U.S. statutory tax rate, and therefore, foreign tax credits associated with these earnings exceeds any incremental U.S. tax liabilities. Adjustments to valuation allowances In 2014 , we increased the valuation allowance against foreign tax credits as a result of removing the permanent reinvestment assertion on our U.K. operations since the U.K. statutory tax rate is in excess of the U.S. statutory tax rate. In 2013, valuation allowances decreased primarily due to the disposal of our Indonesian assets. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about income taxes. Discontinued operations is presented net of tax. We closed the sale of our Angola assets in the first quarter of 2014 and our Norway business in the fourth quarter of 2014, and both are reflected as discontinued operations and excluded from the International E&P segment in all periods presented. Included in discontinued operations for 2014 are after-tax gains of $532 million and $976 million related to the dispositions of Angola and Norway, respectively. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. Average net sales volumes from Norway were 52 mboed and 79 mboed in 2014 and 2013. Sales volumes decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily as the result of water breakthrough, as anticipated at Volund, as well as natural decline in the remaining fields. Alvheim sales were also impacted in 2014 by severe winter weather during the first quarter which resulted in eight days of curtailed production and again during the third quarter due to planned maintenance and system upgrades on the Alvheim FPSO. In addition, 2014 Norway sales volumes are only reported through the October 15, 2014 close date. Segment Results: 2014 compared to 2013 Segment income for 2014 and 2013 is summarized and reconciled to net income in the following table. Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2014 2013 North America E&P $ 693 $ 529 International E&P 568 758 Oil Sands Mining 235 206 Segment income 1,496 1,493 Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes: Corporate and other unallocated items (399 ) (470 ) Unrealized loss on crude oil derivative instruments (33 ) Net loss on dispositions (58 ) (20 ) Impairments (70 ) (39 ) Income from continuing operations 969 931 Discontinued operations 2,077 822 Net income $ 3,046 $ 1,753 North America E&P segment income increased $164 million in 2014 compared to 2013 . The increase was largely due to increased liquid hydrocarbon net sales volumes primarily in the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Oklahoma Resource Basins and lower exploration expenses, partially offset by lower average price realizations. International E&P segment income decreased $190 million in 2014 compared to 2013 . The decrease was primarily due to lower liquid hydrocarbon net sales volumes and lower average price realizations partially offset by a decrease in the taxes related to Libya, a high tax jurisdiction. Also, other operating expenses were higher in 2014 primarily due to the impact of a settlement related to the calculation of the net profits interest payments associated with our Alba Plant equity interests in E.G. Oil Sands Mining segment income increased $29 million in 2014 compared to 2013 . This increase was primarily a result of higher operating expenses in 2013 related to a turnaround. 45 Consolidated Results of Operations: 2013 compared to 2012 Consolidated income from continuing operations after income taxes in 2013 was 9 percent higher than 2012 primarily due to higher net sales volumes in the North America E&P segment, partially offset by higher exploration expenses and lower net sales volumes as well as lower average price realizations in the International E&P segment. Sales and other operating revenues, including related party are summarized by segment in the following table: Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2013 2012 Sales and other operating revenues, including related party North America E&P $ 5,068 $ 3,944 International E&P 2,654 3,719 Oil Sands Mining 1,576 1,521 Segment sales and other operating revenues, including related party 9,298 9,184 Unrealized gain (loss) on crude oil derivative instruments (52 ) 53 Sales and other operating revenues, including related party $ 9,246 $ 9,237 North America E&P sales and other operating revenues increased $1,124 million from 2012 to 2013 primarily due to higher liquid hydrocarbon net sales volumes resulting from ongoing development programs in the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Oklahoma Resource Basins, partially offset by lower natural gas net sales volumes, primarily the result of the sale of our Alaska assets in early 2013 . The following table displays changes in North America E&P segment sales and other operating revenues by product.

This increase was primarily due to a higher proportion of net sales volumes related to a premium grade synthetic crude oil and the associated higher average price realizations when compared to 2012 . The increase was partially offset by lower feedstock sales in 2013 . The following table displays changes in OSM segment sales of synthetic crude oil and other operating revenues. Refer to the preceding Market Conditions and Sales sections for additional detail related to average price realizations and net sales. Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) Related to Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2012 Price Realizations Net Sales Volumes 2013 Oil Sands Mining Price-Volume Analysis Synthetic crude oil $ 1,409 $ 102 $ 31 $ 1,542 Other sales 112 34 Total $ 1,521 $ 1,576 Unrealized gains and losses on crude oil derivative instruments are included in total sales and other operating revenues but are not allocated to the segments. These crude oil derivative instruments, all of which expired in December 2013, resulted in a $52 million net unrealized loss in 2013 compared to a net unrealized gain of $53 million in 2012 . See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for information about our derivative positions. Marketing revenues decreased $650 million in 2013 from 2012 . North America E&P segment marketing activities, which serve to aggregate volumes in order to satisfy transportation commitments as well as to achieve flexibility within product types and delivery points, decreased in 2013 as a result of market dynamics. Income from equity method investments increased $53 million in 2013 from the prior year primarily due to higher LNG average price realizations. Net gain (loss) on disposal of assets in 2013 primarily included pretax losses on the sale of our DJ Basin interests and the conveyance of our Marcellus interests to the operator offset by pretax gains on the sales of the Neptune gas plant and our remaining assets in Alaska. The net gain on disposal of assets in 2012 consisted primarily of a pretax gain on the sale of our interests in several Gulf of Mexico crude oil pipeline systems partially offset by a pretax loss related to our exit from Indonesia. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further details about these dispositions. Production expenses increased $77 million in 2013 from 2012 primarily related to increased North America E&P net sales volumes in the Eagle Ford and Bakken, partially offset by decreased International E&P net sales volumes. The production expense rate (expense per boe) decreased in North America E&P in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to improved operating efficiencies in the Eagle Ford . The production expense rate (expense per boe) increase in International E&P in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to maintenance and workovers performed in Libya while production was down as a result of third-party labor strikes at the Es Sider terminal during the second half of 2013. The following table provides production expense rates (expense per boe) for each segment: ($ per boe) 2013 2012 North America E&P $10.86 $11.59 International E&P $6.36 $5.85 Oil Sands Mining (a) $46.30 $45.95 (a) Production expense per synthetic crude oil barrel (before royalties) includes production costs, shipping and handling, taxes other than income and insurance costs and excludes pre-development costs. Marketing expenses decreased $658 million in 2013 from the prior year, consistent with the decreases in marketing revenues discussed above. 47 Exploration expenses were $206 million higher in 2013 than in 2012 , primarily due to larger non-cash unproved property impairments in our North America E&P segment related to Eagle Ford leases that either expired or that we did not expect to drill, partially offset by reduced dry well costs and geological and geophysical costs. Unproved property impairments in 2012 related to Marcellus, Eagle Ford, and Indonesia. Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2013 2012 Unproved property impairments $ 572 $ 227 Dry well costs 148 230 Geological and geophysical 80 127 Other 91 101 Total exploration expenses $ 891 $ 685 Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $492 million in 2013 from the prior year. Our segments apply the units-of-production method to the majority of their assets, including capitalized asset retirement costs. Increased DD&A in 2013 primarily reflects the impact of higher North America E&P sales volumes as well as increased amortization of capitalized asset retirement costs due to revisions of estimates for abandonment obligations in the Gulf of Mexico and the U.K, partially offset by the disposition of our Alaska assets in January 2013. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for information about the Alaska disposition. The DD&A rate (expense per boe), which is impacted by changes in reserves, capitalized costs and sales volume mix by field, can also cause changes to our DD&A. A higher 2013 DD&A rate in North America E&P versus 2012 is due to the ongoing development programs in the U.S. resource plays. A higher 2013 DD&A rate in International E&P versus 2012 is due to an increase in estimated abandonment costs in the U.K. The following table provides DD&A rates for each segment: ($ per boe) 2013 2012 North America E&P $26.23 $23.45 International E&P $5.86 $4.96 Oil Sands Mining $12.39 $12.57 Impairments in 2013 primarily related to capitalized costs associated with engineering and feasibility studies for a second LNG production train in E.G., the Ozona development in the Gulf of Mexico and our Powder River Basin asset in Wyoming. Impairments in 2012 were also related to the Ozona development and Powder River Basin. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for information about these impairments. Taxes other than income include production, severance and ad valorem taxes in the United States, which tend to increase or decrease in relation to sales volumes and revenues, and increased $102 million in 2013 from 2012 . With the increase in North America E&P revenues and net sales volumes, production and severance taxes increased $76 million in 2013 from 2012 . In addition, ad valorem taxes were slightly higher because the value of our North America E&P assets has increased with continued acquisitions in the Eagle Ford. Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2013 2012 Production and severance $ 202 $ 126 Ad valorem 61 57 Other 82 60 Total $ 345 $ 243 Net interest and other increased $56 million in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to higher interest expense related to our $2 billion issuance of senior notes in late 2012. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed information. 48 Provision for income taxes decreased $786 million in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to the decrease in pretax income from continuing operations, primarily in Libya, which is a higher tax jurisdiction. The following is an analysis of the effective income tax rates for 2013 and 2012 : 2013 2012 Statutory rate applied to income from continuing operations before income taxes 35 % 35 % Effects of foreign operations, including foreign tax credits 26 36 Adjustments to valuation allowances (1 ) Other 1 1 Effective income tax rate on continuing operations 61 % 72 % The effective income tax rate is influenced by a variety of factors including the geographic sources of income and the relative magnitude of these sources of income. The difference between the total provision and the sum of the amounts allocated to segments appears in the "Corporate and other unallocated items" shown in the reconciliation of segment income to net income below. Effects of foreign operations The effects of foreign operations on our effective tax rate decreased in 2013 as compared to 2012 , primarily due to decreased sales in Libya during 2013 as a result of third-party labor strikes at the Es Sider oil terminal. Excluding Libya, the effective tax rates on continuing operations for 2013 and 2012 would be 38 percent and 37 percent . See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about income taxes. Discontinued operations is presented net of tax. In 2014, we closed the sales of our Angola assets and Norway business; therefore, the Angola and Norway operations are reflected as discontinued operations in all periods presented. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. Average net sales volumes from Norway were 79 mboed and 90 mboed in 2013 and 2012. Sales volumes decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily as the result of well workovers in 2013 as well as natural decline in the remaining fields. Segment Results: 2013 compared to 2012 Segment income for 2013 and 2012 is summarized and reconciled to net income in the following table. Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2013 2012 North America E&P $ 529 $ 382 International E&P 758 895 Oil Sands Mining 206 171 Segment income 1,493 1,448 Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes: Corporate and other unallocated items (470 ) (467 ) Unrealized gain (loss) on crude oil derivative instruments (33 ) 34 Net gain (loss) on dispositions (20 ) 72 Impairments (39 ) (231 ) Income from continuing operations 931 856 Discontinued operations 822 726 Net income $ 1,753 $ 1,582 North America E&P segment income increased $147 million in 2013 compared to 2012 . The increase was largely due to increased liquid hydrocarbon net sales volumes primarily in the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Oklahoma Resource Basins, partially offset by higher DD&A associated with the higher sales volumes. Segment income in 2013 was also negatively impacted by the previously discussed higher exploration expenses related to non-cash unproved property impairments and the sale of our Alaska assets. International E&P segment income decreased $137 million in 2013 compared to 2012 . The decrease was primarily related to the lower liquid hydrocarbon net sales volumes in Libya and lower average liquid hydrocarbon price realizations, partially offset by lower taxes as a result of decreased pretax income from Libya which is a higher tax jurisdiction. 49 Oil Sands Mining segment income increased $35 million in 2013 compared to 2012 . This increase was primarily due to a higher proportion of net sales volumes in 2013 related to a premium grade of synthetic crude oil with an average higher corresponding price realization. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, Cash Flows and Liquidity Cash Flows The following table presents sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for 2014 , 2013 and 2012 : Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2014 2013 2012 Sources of cash and cash equivalents Continuing operations $ 4,736 $ 4,388 $ 2,874 Discontinued operations 751 882 1,143 Disposals of assets 3,760 450 467 Borrowings including commercial paper, net 2,197 Other 214 189 129 Total sources of cash and cash equivalents $ 9,461 $ 5,909 $ 6,810 Uses of cash and cash equivalents Acquisitions $ (21 ) $ (74 ) $ (1,033 ) Additions to property, plant and equipment (5,160 ) (4,443 ) (4,361 ) Investing activities of discontinued operations (376 ) (550 ) (579 ) Purchases of common stock (1,000 ) (500 ) Commercial paper, net (135 ) (65 ) Debt repayments (68 ) (182 ) (145 ) Dividends paid (543 ) (508 ) (480 ) Other (24 ) (7 ) (21 ) Total uses of cash and cash equivalents $ (7,327 ) $ (6,329 ) $ (6,619 ) While the 2014 commodity benchmark prices were relatively strong for most of the year, beginning in the second half of 2014 these benchmarks began to decline and continued to decline during the early portion of 2015 and remain volatile based on global supply and demand. While we are unable to predict future commodity price movements, if this lower price trend continues, it would negatively impact our cash flows from operating activities. Cash flows from continuing operations in 2014 were higher than in 2013 due to increased net sales volumes in the North America E&P segment and lower cash tax payments (primarily Libya, a higher tax jurisdiction), partially offset by lower average price realizations in all segments, as well as lower net sales volumes in the International E&P segment. The increase in cash flows from continuing operations in 2013 primarily reflects the increase in North America E&P liquid hydrocarbon net sales volumes on operating income. Disposals of assets in 2014 primarily reflect the $2 billion aggregate proceeds from the sale of our Angola assets in the first quarter and $2.1 billion proceeds from the sale of our Norway business in the fourth quarter. In 2013, net proceeds were primarily related to the sales of our interests in Alaska, the Neptune gas plant and the DJ Basin. In 2012, net proceeds were primarily from the sales of our interests in several Gulf of Mexico crude oil pipeline systems, a sell-down of our interests in the Harir and Safen blocks in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq and the final collection of proceeds on a 2009 asset sale. Disposition transactions are discussed in further detail in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. 50 Additions to property, plant and equipment are our most significant use of cash and cash equivalents. The following table shows capital expenditures related to continuing operations by segment and reconciles to additions to property, plant and equipment as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows for 2014 , 2013 and 2012 : Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2014 2013 2012 North America E&P $ 4,698 $ 3,649 $ 3,988 International E&P 534 456 235 Oil Sands Mining 212 286 188 Corporate 51 58 115 Total capital expenditures 5,495 4,449 4,526 Change in capital expenditure accrual (335 ) (6 ) (165 ) Additions to property, plant and equipment $ 5,160 $ 4,443 $ 4,361 As of December 31, 2014 , we had repurchased a total of 121 million common shares at a cost of $4.7 billion, including 29 million shares at a cost of $1 billion in the first six months of 2014 and 14 million shares at a cost of $500 million in the third quarter of 2013. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of purchases of common stock. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our main sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, internally generated cash flow from operations, continued access to capital markets, our committed revolving credit facility and sales of non-strategic assets. Our working capital requirements are supported by these sources and we may issue commercial paper backed by our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility to meet short-term cash requirements. Because of the alternatives available to us as discussed above and access to capital markets through the shelf registration discussed below, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements including our capital spending programs, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies. At December 31, 2014, we had approximately $4.9 billion of liquidity consisting of $2.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $2.5 billion availability under our revolving credit facility. As discussed in more detail below in Outlook , we are targeting a $3.5 billion Budget for 2015. Based on our projected 2015 cash outlays for our capital program and dividends, we expect to outspend our cash flows from operations for the year. We will be constantly monitoring our available liquidity during 2015 and we have the flexibility to adjust our Budget throughout the year in response to the commodity price environment. We will also continue to drive the fundamentals of expense management, including organizational capacity and operational reliability. Capital Resources Credit Arrangements and Borrowings In May 2014, we amended our $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and extended the maturity to May 2019. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional terms and rates. At December 31, 2014 , we had no borrowings against our revolving credit facility and no amounts outstanding under our U.S. commercial paper program that is backed by the revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2014 , we had $6,391 million in long-term debt outstanding, and $1,068 million is due within one year, of which the majority is due in the fourth quarter of 2015. We do not have any triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an event of default in the case of a downgrade of our credit ratings. Shelf Registration We have a universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC, under which we, as "well-known seasoned issuer" for purposes of SEC rules, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities from time to time. 51 Cash-Adjusted Debt-To-Capital Ratio Our cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio (total debt-minus-cash to total debt-plus-equity-minus-cash) was 16 percent at December 31, 2014 and 25 percent at December 31, 2013 . (Dollars in millions) 2014 2013 Commercial paper $ $ 135 Long-term debt due within one year 1,068 68 Long-term debt 5,323 6,394 Total debt $ 6,391 $ 6,597 Cash $ 2,398 $ 264 Equity $ 21,020 $ 19,344 Calculation Total debt $ 6,391 $ 6,597 Minus cash 2,398 264 Total debt minus cash 3,993 6,333 Total debt 6,391 6,597 Plus equity 21,020 19,344 Minus cash 2,398 264 Total debt plus equity minus cash $ 25,013 $ 25,677 Cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio 16 % 25 % Capital Requirements Capital Spending Our approved Budget for 2015 is $3.5 billion. Additional details are discussed below in "Outlook." Share Repurchase Program The remaining share repurchase authorization as of December 31, 2014 is $1.5 billion. Other Expected Cash Outflows As of December 31, 2014 , $1,068 million of our long-term debt is due in the next twelve months, most of which is due in the fourth quarter of 2015. Dividends of $ 543 million were paid during 2014 reflecting quarterly dividends of $0.19 per share in the first two quarters of the year and $0.21 per share in the last two quarters. On January 28, 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors had declared a dividend of $0.21 cents per share on Marathon Oil common stock, payable March 10, 2015, to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 18, 2015. We plan to make contributions of up to $95 million to our funded pension plans during 2015 . Cash contributions to be paid from our general assets for the unfunded pension and postretirement plans are expected to be approximately $11 million and $19 million in 2015 . 52 Contractual Cash Obligations The table below provides aggregated information on our consolidated obligations to make future payments under existing contracts as of December 31, 2014 . (In millions) Total 2015 2016- 2017 2018- 2019 Later Years Short and long-term debt (includes interest) (a) $ 10,102 $ 1,363 $ 1,272 $ 1,508 $ 5,959 Lease obligations 200 41 61 50 48 Purchase obligations: Oil and gas activities (b) 783 442 218 74 49 Service and materials contracts (c) 1,077 166 199 89 623 Transportation and related contracts 1,933 222 475 434 802 Drilling rigs and fracturing crews (d) 629 422 207 Other 192 50 29 30 83 Total purchase obligations 4,614 1,302 1,128 627 1,557 Other long-term liabilities reported in the consolidated balance sheet (e) 943 133 156 214 440 Total contractual cash obligations (f) $ 15,859 $ 2,839 $ 2,617 $ 2,399 $ 8,004 (a) Includes anticipated cash payments for interest of $295 million for 2015 , $590 million for 2016-2017, $426 million for 2018-2019 and $2,422 million for the remaining years for a total of $3,733 million . (b) Oil and gas activities include contracts to acquire property, plant and equipment and commitments for oil and gas exploration such as costs related to contractually obligated exploratory work programs that are expensed immediately. (c) Service and materials contracts include contracts to purchase services such as utilities, supplies and various other maintenance and operating services. (d) Some contracts may be canceled at an amount less than the contract amount. Were we to elect that option where possible at December 31, 2014 our minimum commitment would be $459 million. (e) Primarily includes obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits including medical and life insurance. We have estimated projected funding requirements through 2024. Although unrecognized tax benefits are not a contractual obligation, they are presented in this table because they represent potential demands on our liquidity. (f) This table does not include the estimated discounted liability for dismantlement, abandonment and restoration costs of oil and gas properties of $1,958 million . See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements. Transactions with Related Parties We own a 63 percent working interest in the Alba field offshore E.G. Onshore E.G., we own a 52 percent interest in an LPG processing plant, a 60 percent interest in an LNG production facility and a 45 percent interest in a methanol production plant, each through equity method investees. We sell our natural gas from the Alba field to these equity method investees as the feedstock for their production processes. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Off-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Although off-balance sheet arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes, we are not dependent on these arrangements to maintain our liquidity and capital resources, and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the off-balance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources. We will issue stand alone letters of credit when required by a business partner. Such letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 aggregated $101 million, $119 million, and $139 million. Most of the letters of credit are in support of obligations recorded in the consolidated balance sheet. For example, they are issued to counterparties to insure our payments for outstanding company debt and future abandonment liabilities. 53 Outlook Budget Our Board of Directors approved a Budget of $3.5 billion for 2015 , including capital expenditures of $3.4 billion. With the continued uncertainty in commodity pricing, we have taken decisive action to protect our optionality and position us to be a stronger E&P company in the long term. Our exploration spending has been reduced by more than 50 percent while we continue to focus on our three U.S. resource plays. We are also prepared to exercise further flexibility in our spend levels as pricing and the macro environment warrant. Our Budget is broken down by reportable segment in the table below. (In millions) 2015 Budget Percent of Total North America E&P $ 2,885 82 % International E&P 536 15 % Oil Sands Mining (a) 21 1 % Segment total 3,442 98 % Corporate and other 79 2 % Total capital, investment and exploration spending budget $ 3,521 100 % (a) Represents the net budget after factoring in reimbursements from the Canadian Federal and Provincial government related to the QUEST CCS project. North America E&P Approximately $2.4 billion of our Budget is allocated to our three core U.S. resource plays. More than $1.4 billion is earmarked for the Eagle Ford, where rig count is expected to drop from 18 in late 2014 to 10 by the end of the second quarter of 2015. Included in Eagle Ford spending is approximately $1 billion for drilling and completions. We plan to spend $760 million in the Bakken in North Dakota. Drilling activity will be reduced to two rigs by the end of the first quarter of 2015, down from seven rigs at the end of 2014. Bakken spending includes approximately $550 million for drilling, completions and recompletions. Spending of $226 million is targeted for the Oklahoma Resource Basins, which will also be down to two rigs by the end of the first quarter of 2015. This includes spending of approximately $200 million for drilling and completions. International E&P We plan to spend approximately $429 million on our international assets, primarily in E.G., the U.K. and the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. Approximately $232 million will be spent on a targeted exploration program impacting both the North America E&P and the International E&P segments. The program includes one operated Gulf of Mexico well, participation in a non-operated appraisal well at Shenandoah in the Gulf of Mexico and seismic surveys in Gabon and Ethiopia. Oil Sands Mining We expect to spend $95 million for sustaining capital projects in the OSM segment. We hold a 20 percent outside-operated interest in the Athabasca Oil Sands Project. The remainder of our Budget consists of Corporate and Other and is expected to total approximately $79 million, of which $40 million represents capitalized interest on assets under construction. For information about expected exploration and development activities more specific to individual assets, see Item 1. Business. Production Volumes We forecast 2015 production available for sale from the combined North America E&P and International E&P segments, excluding Libya, to be 370 to 390 net mboed and the OSM segment to be 35 to 45 net mbbld of synthetic crude oil. We expect our U.S. resource plays to achieve production growth of approximately 20 percent in 2015 over 2014. In addition, we expect total production growth, excluding Libya, of 5 to 7 percent year-over-year. Acquisitions and Dispositions Excluded from our Budget are the impacts of acquisitions and dispositions not previously announced. We continually evaluate ways to optimize our portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures. In connection with our ongoing portfolio management, future decisions to dispose of assets could result in non-cash impairments in the period such decisions are made. Personnel In February 2015, we announced a reduction in workforce impacting approximately 350-400 employees. These reductions focus largely on U.S. payroll employees, weighted toward above-the-field and support services personnel, though we will continue to analyze our staffing needs at all levels and in all locations. Affected employees will be eligible for severance benefits. 54 Other Two exploratory wells: Key Largo in the Gulf of Mexico and Sodalita West #1 in E.G. were deemed unsuccessful in early 2015, with well costs incurred through December 31, 2014 charged to dry well expense. In addition, approximately $45 million in costs related to these wells will be charged to dry well expense in the first quarter of 2015. Management Discussion and Analysis of Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies We have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes. Legislation and regulations pertaining to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions have the potential to materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including costs of compliance and permitting delays. The extent and magnitude of these adverse impacts cannot be reliably or accurately estimated at this time because specific regulatory and legislative requirements have not been finalized and uncertainty exists with respect to the measures being considered, the costs and the time frames for compliance, and our ability to pass compliance costs on to our customers. For additional information see Item 1A. Risk Factors. We accrue for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated. As environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise, charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required. New or expanded environmental requirements, which could increase our environmental costs, may arise in the future. We strive to comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment, but as not all costs are fixed or presently determinable (even under existing legislation) and may be affected by future legislation or regulations, it is not possible to predict all of the ultimate costs of compliance, including remediation costs that may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed. For more information on environmental regulations that impact us, or could impact us, see Item 1. Business Environmental, Health and Safety Matters, Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 3. Legal Proceedings. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods. Accounting estimates are considered to be critical if (1) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and (2) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. Estimated Quantities of Net Reserves The estimation of quantities of net reserves is a highly technical process performed by our engineers for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas and by outside consultants for synthetic crude oil, which is based upon several underlying assumptions that are subject to change. Estimates of reserves may change, either positively or negatively, as additional information becomes available and as contractual, operational, economic and political conditions change. We evaluate our reserves using drilling results, reservoir performance, seismic interpretation and future plans to develop acreage. The data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. Consequently, material revisions (upward or downward) to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. Reserve estimates are based upon an unweighted average of commodity prices in the prior 12-month period, using the closing prices on the first day of each month. Sustained reduced commodity prices could have a material effect on the quantity and present value of our proved reserves and could also cause us to decrease our near term capital programs and defer investment until prices improved. A shifting of capital expenditures into future periods outside of five years from the initial proved reserve booking could potentially lead to a reduction in proved undeveloped reserves. For a discussion of our reserve estimation process, including the use of third-party audits, see Item 1. Business. We use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities. The successful efforts method inherently relies on the estimation of proved crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves. 55 The existence and the estimated amount of reserves affect, among other things, whether certain costs are capitalized or expensed, the amount and timing of costs depreciated, depleted or amortized into net income and the presentation of supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities. Additionally, both the expected future cash flows to be generated by oil and gas producing properties used in testing such properties for impairment and the expected future taxable income available to realize deferred tax assets also rely, in part, on estimates of quantities of net reserves. Depreciation and depletion of crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil producing properties is determined by the units-of-production method and could change with revisions to estimated proved reserves. Over the past three years, the impact on our depreciation and depletion rate due to revisions of previous reserve estimates has not been significant to any of our segments. However, because we depreciate a majority of our oil and gas properties under the units-of-production method, any reduction in proved reserves could result in an acceleration of future DD&A expense. The following table illustrates, on average, the sensitivity of each segment's units-of-production DD&A per boe and pretax income to a hypothetical five percent change in 2014 proved reserves based on 2014 production. Impact of a Five Percent Increase in Proved Reserves Impact of a Five Percent Decrease in Proved Reserves (In millions, except per boe) DD&A per boe Pretax Income DD&A per boe Pretax Income North America E&P $ (1.28 ) $ 112 $ 1.42 $ (123 ) International E&P $ (0.28 ) $ 13 $ 0.30 $ (14 ) Oil Sands Mining $ (0.63 ) $ 9 $ 0.55 $ (8 ) Asset Retirement Obligations We have material legal, regulatory and contractual obligations to remove and dismantle long-lived assets and to restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations, including bitumen mining operations. A liability equal to the fair value of such obligations and a corresponding capitalized asset retirement cost are recognized on the balance sheet in the period in which the legal obligation is incurred and a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The capitalized asset retirement cost is depreciated using the units-of-production method and the discounted liability is accreted over the period until the obligation is satisfied, the impacts of which are recognized as DD&A in the consolidated statements of income. In many cases, the satisfaction and subsequent discharge of these liabilities is projected to occur many years, or even decades, into the future. Furthermore, the legal, regulatory and contractual requirements often do not provide specific guidance regarding removal practices and the criteria that must be fulfilled when the removal and/or restoration event actually occurs. Estimates of retirement costs are developed for each property based on numerous factors, such as the scope of the dismantlement, timing of settlement, interpretation of legal, regulatory and contractual requirements, type of production and processing structures, depth of water (if applicable), reservoir characteristics, depth of the reservoir, market demand for equipment, currently available dismantlement and restoration procedures and consultations with construction and engineering professionals. Inflation rates and credit-adjusted-risk-free interest rates are then applied to estimate the fair values of the obligations. To the extent these or other assumptions change after initial recognition of the liability, the fair value estimate is revised and the recognized liability adjusted, with a corresponding adjustment made to the related asset balance or income statement, as appropriate. Changes in estimated asset retirement obligations for late life assets could result in future impairment charges. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures regarding our asset retirement obligation estimates. An estimate of the sensitivity to net income if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practical because of the number of obligations that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of possible assumptions. 56 Fair Value Estimates Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. There are three approaches for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities: the market approach, the income approach and the cost approach, each of which includes multiple valuation techniques. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach uses valuation techniques to measure fair value by converting future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, into a single present value, or range of present values, using current market expectations about those future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace the service capacity of an asset. This is often referred to as current replacement cost. The cost approach assumes that the fair value would not exceed what it would cost a market participant to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility, adjusted for obsolescence. The fair value accounting standards do not prescribe which valuation technique should be used when measuring fair value and do not prioritize among the techniques. These standards establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in applying the various valuation techniques. Inputs broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make pricing decisions, including assumptions about risk. Level 1 inputs are given the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy while Level 3 inputs are given the lowest priority. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: Level 1 Observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets as of the measurement date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 2 Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. These are inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date. Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data and may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management best estimate of fair value. Valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs are favored. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest priority level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities within the levels of the fair value hierarchy. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures regarding our fair value measurements. Significant uses of fair value measurements include: impairment assessments of long-lived assets; impairment assessments of goodwill; allocation of the purchase price paid to acquire businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed; and recorded value of derivative instruments. Impairment Assessments of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill The need to test long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment can be based on several indicators, including a significant reduction in prices of crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas or synthetic crude oil, unfavorable adjustments to reserves, significant changes in the expected timing of production, other changes to contracts or changes in the regulatory environment in which the property is located. Long-lived assets in use are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. For purposes of an impairment evaluation, long-lived assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified, which generally is field-by-field for our North America E&P and International E&P assets and at the project level for OSM assets. If the sum of the undiscounted estimated cash flows from the use of the asset group and its eventual disposition is less than the carrying value of an asset group, the carrying value is written down to the estimated fair value. The substantial decline in commodity prices during the second half of 2014, and the resulting change in future commodity price assumptions, was a triggering event which required us to reassess long-lived assets related to oil and gas producing properties for impairment as of December 31, 2014. We estimated the fair values using an income approach and concluded that no material impairments were required. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of impairments recorded in 2014, 2013 and 2012. Future impairments of long-lived assets are possible if management current assumptions were to change. Unlike long-lived assets, goodwill must be tested for impairment at least annually, or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying 57 amount. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. After we performed our annual impairment test in April 2014, there was a substantial decline in commodity prices as discussed above. The resulting change in future commodity price assumptions, was a triggering event which required us to reassess our goodwill for impairment as of December 31, 2014. Based on the results of this assessment, we concluded no impairment was required. The calculated fair value of the North America E&P and International E&P reporting units exceeded their respective book values by a significant margin. Fair value calculated for the purpose of testing our long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment is estimated using the present value of expected future cash flows method and comparative market prices when appropriate. Significant judgment is involved in performing these fair value estimates since the results are based on forecasted assumptions. Significant assumptions include: Future crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil prices. Our estimates of future prices are based on our analysis of market supply and demand and consideration of market price indicators. Although these commodity prices may experience extreme volatility in any given year, we believe long-term industry prices are driven by global market supply and demand. To estimate supply, we consider numerous factors, including the worldwide resource base, depletion rates, and OPEC production policies. We believe demand is largely driven by global economic factors, such as population and income growth, governmental policies and vehicle stocks. The prices we use in our fair value estimates are consistent with those used in our planning and capital investment reviews. There has been significant volatility in crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil prices and estimates of such future prices are inherently imprecise. Estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil. Such quantities are based on a combination of proved and probable reserves such that the combined volumes represent the most likely expectation of recovery. Expected timing of production. Production forecasts are the outcome of engineer studies which estimate reserves, as well as expected capital development programs. The actual timing of the production could be different than the projection. Cash flows realized later in the projection period are less valuable than those realized earlier due to the time value of money. The expected timing of production that we use in our fair value estimates is consistent with that used in our planning and capital investment reviews. Discount rate commensurate with the risks involved. We apply a discount rate to our expected cash flows based on a variety of factors, including market and economic conditions, operational risk, regulatory risk and political risk. This discount rate is also compared to recent observable market transactions, if possible. A higher discount rate decreases the net present value of cash flows. Future capital requirements. Our estimates of future capital requirements are based upon a combination of authorized spending and internal forecasts. We base our fair value estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonable. However, actual results may differ from these projections. A further sustained decline in commodity prices may cause us to reassess our long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment, and could result in future non-cash impairment charges as a result of such impairment assessments. An estimate of the sensitivity to net income resulting from impairment calculations is not practicable, given the numerous assumptions (e.g. reserves, pricing and discount rates) that can materially affect our estimates. That is, unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions may be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions. Acquisitions In accounting for business combinations, the purchase price paid to acquire a business is allocated to its assets and liabilities based on the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. A significant amount of judgment is involved in estimating the individual fair values of property, plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets. The most significant assumptions relate to the estimated fair values allocated to proved and unproved liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil properties. Estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired can have a significant effect on our results of operations in the future. We use all available information to make these fair value determinations and, for certain acquisitions, engage third-party consultants for assistance. During 2014, 2013 and 2012, we completed several business combinations in the Eagle Ford, the purchase prices of which were allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). The fair values used to allocate the purchase price of an acquisition are often estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method, which requires us to estimate reserves as described above under Estimated Quantities of Net Reserves, project related future cash inflows and outflows and apply an appropriate discount rate. The estimates used in 58 determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain. Accordingly, actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value. Derivatives We record all derivative instruments at fair value. Fair value measurements for all our derivative instruments are based on observable market-based inputs that are corroborated by market data and are discussed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. Additional information about derivatives and their valuation may be found in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in numerous taxing jurisdictions worldwide. Estimates of income taxes to be recorded involve interpretation of complex tax laws and assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our U.S. federal income taxes. We have recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between book basis and tax basis, tax credit carryforwards and operating loss carryforwards. We routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In assessing the need for additional or adjustments to existing valuation allowances, we consider the preponderance of evidence concerning the realization of the deferred tax asset. We must consider any prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that might minimize the amount of deferred tax liabilities recognized or the amount of any valuation allowance recognized against deferred tax assets, if we can implement the strategies and we expect to implement them in the event the forecasted conditions actually occur. Assumptions related to the permanent reinvestment of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are reconsidered quarterly to give effect to changes in our portfolio of producing properties and in our tax profile. In the second quarter of 2014, we reviewed our foreign operations, including the disposition of our Norway business, and concluded that our foreign operations do not have the same level of immediate capital needs as previously expected. Therefore, we no longer intend for previously unremitted foreign earnings associated with our U.K. operations to be permanently reinvested outside the U.S. Our net deferred tax assets, after valuation allowances, are expected to be realized through our future taxable income and the reversal of temporary differences. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the estimation of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil prices) and the assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our U.S. federal income taxes. The estimates and assumptions used in determining future taxable income are consistent with those used in our planning and capital investment reviews. We consider a combination of reserve categories related to our existing producing properties, as well as estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil related to undeveloped discoveries if, in our judgment, it is likely that development plans will be approved in the foreseeable future. Assumptions regarding our ability to realize the U.S. federal benefit of foreign tax credits are based on certain estimates concerning future operating conditions (particularly as related to crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil prices), future financial conditions, income generated from foreign sources and our tax profile in the year that such credits may be claimed. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations Accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the following: the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; the expected long-term return on plan assets; the rate of future increases in compensation levels; and health care cost projections. We develop our demographics and utilize the work of third-party actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations. We have selected different discount rates for our U.S. pension plans and our other U.S. postretirement benefit plans due to the different projected benefit payment patterns. In determining the assumed discount rates, our methods include a review of market yields on high-quality corporate debt and use of our third-party actuary's discount rate model. This model calculates an equivalent single discount rate for the projected benefit plan cash flows using a yield curve derived from bond yields. The yield curve represents a series of annualized individual spot discount rates from 0.5 to 99 years. The bonds used are rated AA or higher by a recognized rating agency, only non-callable bonds are included and outlier bonds (bonds that have a yield to maturity that significantly deviates from the average yield within each maturity grouping) are removed. Each issue is required to have at least $250 million par value outstanding. The constructed yield curve is based on those bonds representing the 50 percent highest yielding issuances within each defined maturity group. 59 Of the assumptions used to measure obligations and estimated annual net periodic benefit cost as of December 31, the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit cost reported for the plans. The hypothetical impacts of a 0.25 percent change in the discount rates of 3.71 percent for our U.S. pension plans and 4.01 percent for our other U.S. postretirement benefit plans is summarized in the table below: Impact of a 0.25 Percent Increase in Discount Rate Impact of a 0.25 Percent Decrease in Discount Rate (In millions) Obligation Expense Obligation Expense U.S. pension plans $ (35 ) $ (4 ) $ 37 $ 4 Other U.S. postretirement benefit plans $ (7 ) $ $ 8 $ The asset rate of return assumption for the funded U.S. plan considers the plan's asset mix (currently targeted at approximately 55 percent equity and 45 percent other fixed income securities), past performance and other factors. Certain components of the asset mix are modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation, debt returns and stock yields. Decreasing the 6.75 percent asset rate of return assumption by 0.25 would not have a significant impact on our defined benefit pension expense. Compensation change assumptions are based on historical experience, anticipated future management actions and demographics of the benefit plans. Health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements includes detailed information about the assumptions used to calculate the components of our annual defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan expense, as well as the obligations and accumulated other comprehensive income reported on the consolidated balance sheets. Contingent Liabilities We accrue contingent liabilities for environmental remediation, tax deficiencies related to operating taxes and litigation claims when such contingencies are probable and estimable. Actual costs can differ from estimates for many reasons. For instance, settlement costs for claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on responsibility and assessments of the amount of damages. Similarly, liabilities for environmental remediation may vary from estimates because of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation, additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination and improvements in technology. Our in-house legal counsel regularly assesses these contingent liabilities. In certain circumstances outside legal counsel is utilized. We generally record losses related to these types of contingencies as other operating expense or general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income, except for tax contingencies unrelated to income taxes, which are recorded as taxes other than income. For additional information on contingent liabilities, see Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Management Discussion and Analysis of Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies. An estimate of the sensitivity to net income if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practical because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, in terms of both the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss. Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
