FINANCIAL REVIEW

The financial section of American Express Company’s (the Company) Annual Report consists of this Financial Review, the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following discussion is designed to provide perspective and understanding regarding the Company’s consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Certain key terms are defined in the Glossary of Selected Terminology, which begins on page 52.

This Financial Review and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements exclude discontinued operations unless otherwise noted.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

BUSINESS INTRODUCTION

American Express is a global services company that provides customers with access to products, insights and experiences that enrich lives and build business success. The Company’s principal products and services are charge and credit payment card products and travel-related services offered to consumers and businesses around the world. The Company’s range of products and services include:

 

•	 	
charge and credit card products;

 

•	 	
expense management products and services;

 

•	 	
consumer and business travel services;

 

•	 	
stored-value products such as Travelers Cheques and other prepaid products;

 

•	 	
network services;

 

•	 	
merchant acquisition and processing, servicing and settlement, and point-of-sale, marketing and information products and services for merchants; and

 

•	 	
fee services, including fraud prevention services and the design of customized customer loyalty and rewards programs.

The Company’s products and services are sold globally to diverse customer groups, including consumers, small businesses, mid-sized companies and large corporations. These products and services are sold through various channels, including direct mail, online applications, in-house and third-party sales forces and direct response advertising.

The Company competes in the global payments industry with charge, credit and debit card networks, issuers and acquirers, as well as evolving alternative payment mechanisms, systems and products. As the payments industry continues to evolve, the Company is facing increasing competition from non-traditional players, such as online networks, telecom providers and software-as-a-service providers, that leverage new technologies and customers’ existing charge and credit card accounts and bank relationships to create payment or other fee-based solutions. The Company is transforming its existing businesses and creating new products and services for the digital marketplace as it increases its share of online spend, enhances customers’ digital experiences and develops platforms for online and mobile commerce.

The Company’s products and services generate the following types of revenue for the Company:

 

•	 	
Discount revenue, which is the Company’s largest revenue source, represents fees generally charged to merchants when cardmembers use their cards to purchase goods and services at merchants on the Company’s network;

 

•	 	
Net card fees, which represent revenue earned for annual card membership fees;

 

•	 	
Travel commissions and fees, which are earned by charging a transaction or management fee for airline or other travel-related transactions;

 

•	 	
Other commissions and fees, which are earned on foreign exchange conversions and card-related fees and assessments;

 

•	 	
Other revenue, which represents insurance premiums earned from cardmember travel and other insurance programs, revenues arising from contracts with partners of our Global Network Services (GNS) business (including royalties and signing fees), publishing revenues and other miscellaneous revenue and fees; and

 

•	 	
Interest on loans, which principally represents interest income earned on outstanding balances.

In addition to funding and operating costs associated with these types of revenue, other major expense categories are related to marketing and reward programs that add new cardmembers and promote cardmember loyalty and spending, and provisions for cardmember credit and fraud losses.

FINANCIAL TARGETS

The Company seeks to achieve three financial targets, on average and over time:

 

•	 	
Revenues net of interest expense growth of at least 8 percent;

 

•	 	
Earnings per share (EPS) growth of 12 to 15 percent; and

 

•	 	
Return on average equity (ROE) of 25 percent or more.

If the Company achieves its EPS and ROE targets, it will seek to return on average and over time approximately 50 percent of the capital it generates to shareholders as dividends or through the repurchases of common stock, which may be subject to certain regulatory restrictions as described herein.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND NON-GAAP MEASURES

financial measures may differ from the calculations of similarly titled measures by other companies.

BANK HOLDING COMPANY

The Company is a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and the Federal Reserve Board (Federal Reserve) is the Company’s primary federal regulator. As such, the Company is subject to the Federal Reserve’s regulations, policies and minimum capital standards.

CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT/OUTLOOK

The Company’s results for 2012 continued to reflect strong spending growth and credit performance in both the United States and internationally. The rate of growth was, however, slower than in the prior year, reflecting in part the impact of a challenging global economic environment. The Company also saw its average loans continue to grow modestly year over year, leading to a 6 percent growth in net interest income while lending loss rates are near all-time lows.

The positive impacts of strong billings and loan growth were offset by lower lending reserve releases this year as compared to the prior year, and three charges taken in the fourth quarter of 2012, related to restructuring of $400 million, Membership Rewards estimation process enhancements of $342 million and cardmember reimbursements of $153 million, in addition to amounts incurred in prior quarters during the year. In 2010 and 2011 the Company saw operating expenses increase as a result of its strategy to invest in the business in light of the favorable impacts of lending reserve releases and the settlement proceeds from Visa and MasterCard. In 2012, the Company’s objective was to grow operating expenses at a slower pace than revenue growth. Adjusting for the fourth quarter restructuring charge, as well as the Visa and MasterCard settlement payments recognized in 2011, the Company was successful in achieving this objective.

The Company believes the restructuring charge taken in the fourth quarter will help to make its cost structure leaner and more efficient. The Company’s aim is to grow operating expenses at an annual rate of less than 3 percent in both 2013 and 2014, with the 2012 operating expenses, excluding the restructuring charge, as the base. The Company will seek to invest in growth opportunities in the United States and internationally and will aim to keep marketing and promotion expenses at approximately 9 percent of revenues.

The Company recognized a $342 million charge in the fourth quarter reflecting enhancements to the process that estimates redemptions of Membership Rewards points by U.S. cardmembers. In particular, the changes increased the global Ultimate Redemption Rate (URR) by approximately 100 basis points, resulting in a URR of 94 percent, representing the estimate of the amount of earned points that will ultimately be redeemed by cardmembers.

The regulatory environment continues to evolve and has heightened the focus that all financial companies, including the Company, must have on their controls and processes. Additional regulation, increased compliance efforts and enhanced regulatory enforcement had an impact on the Company. The review of products and practices will be a continuing focus of regulators, as well as by the Company.

Competition remains extremely intense across the Company’s businesses. In addition, the global economic environment remains uneven. While the Company’s business is diversified, including the corporate card business, a large international business and GNS partners around the world, any impact of potential U.S. income tax law changes and continued budget and debt ceiling discussions in Washington remains uncertain. In addition, the current instability in Europe could further adversely affect global economic conditions, including continued pressure on consumer and corporate confidence and spending, and cause disruptions of the debt, equity and foreign exchange markets. Europe accounted for approximately 11 percent of the Company’s total billed business for the year ended December 31, 2012.

RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVES

The Company recently committed to undertake a companywide restructuring plan designed to contain future operating expenses, adapt parts of the business as more customers transact online or through mobile channels, and provide the resources for additional growth initiatives in the United States and internationally. The charges relating to the plan total approximately $400 million pre-tax (approximately $287 million after-tax), which the Company recognized in the fourth quarter of 2012. The total charges include approximately $370 million pre-tax (approximately $265 million after-tax) in employee severance obligations and other employee-related costs.

A major portion of the restructuring plan involves reengineering the Company’s model in its Global Business Travel group as the Company continues the shift toward online channels and automated servicing tools. It will also include streamlining its staff groups to concentrate more resources in high-growth areas, optimizing the Company’s client management and eliminating duplicate efforts, while continuing to maintain the right focus and resources on risk and control activities. The restructuring is expected to result in the elimination of approximately 5,400 jobs in the aggregate. Those reductions are expected to be partly offset by jobs the Company anticipates to add during the year. Overall staffing levels by year-end 2013 are expected to be 4 to 6 percent less than the current total of 63,500. The restructuring plan is expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2013. The Company estimates that substantially all of the costs will result in future cash expenditures.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies referenced, as applicable, to other financial statement footnotes. Certain of the Company’s accounting policies that require significant management assumptions and judgments are set forth below.

RESERVES FOR CARDMEMBER LOSSES

Reserves for cardmember losses represent management’s best estimate of the probable losses inherent in the Company’s outstanding portfolio of cardmember loans and receivables, as of the balance sheet date.

In estimating these losses management uses statistical models that take into account several factors, including loss migration rates, historical losses and recoveries, portfolio specific risk indicators, current risk management initiatives and concentration of credit risk. Management also considers other external environmental factors in establishing reserves for cardmember losses.

The process of estimating these reserves requires a high degree of judgment. To the extent historical credit experience updated for external environmental trends is not indicative of future performance, actual losses could differ significantly from management’s judgments and expectations, resulting in either higher or lower future provisions for cardmember losses.

As of December 31, 2012, an increase (decrease) in write-offs equivalent to 20 basis points of cardmember loans and receivables balances at such date would increase (decrease) the provision for cardmember losses by approximately $215 million. This sensitivity analysis is provided as a hypothetical scenario to assess the sensitivity of the provision for cardmember losses. It does not represent management’s expectations for write-offs in the future, nor does it include how other portfolio factors such as loss migration rates or recoveries, or the amount of outstanding balances, may impact the level of reserves for cardmember losses and the corresponding impact on the provision for cardmember losses.

LIABILITY FOR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS EXPENSE

The Membership Rewards program is the largest card-based rewards program in the industry. Eligible cardmembers can earn points for purchases charged on most of the Company’s card products. Certain types of purchases allow cardmembers to also earn bonus points. Membership Rewards points are redeemable for a broad variety of rewards including travel, entertainment, retail certificates and merchandise. Points typically do not expire and there is no limit on the number of points a cardmember may earn.

The Company records a Membership Rewards liability that represents the estimated cost of points earned that are expected to be redeemed. The liability reflects management’s judgment regarding ultimate redemptions and associated redemption costs.

Management uses statistical and actuarial models to estimate ultimate redemption rates of points earned to date by current cardmembers based on redemption trends of current enrollees, card product type, enrollment tenure, card spend levels and credit attributes. A weighted-average cost per point redeemed during the previous twelve months, adjusted as appropriate for recent changes in redemption costs, including mix of rewards redeemed, is used to estimate redemption costs. Management periodically evaluates its liability estimation process and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns, cost per point redeemed, partner contract changes and other factors.

The liability for the estimated cost of earned points expected to be redeemed is impacted over time by enrollment levels, points earned and redeemed, and the weighted-average cost per point, which is influenced by redemption choices made by cardmembers, reward offerings by partners and other Membership Rewards program changes.

Changes in the URR and weighted-average cost per point have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the liability through the current period marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expense by an amount estimated to cover the cost of all points previously earned but not yet redeemed by current enrollees as of the end of the reporting period. As of December 31, 2012, an increase in the estimated URR of current enrollees of 100 basis points would increase the balance sheet liability and corresponding expense for the cost of Membership Rewards by approximately $270 million. Similarly, an increase in the weighted-average cost (WAC) per point of 1 basis point would increase the balance sheet liability and corresponding expense for the cost of Membership Rewards by approximately $80 million.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

The Company holds investment securities and derivative instruments that are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management makes assumptions and judgments when estimating the fair values of these financial instruments.

In accordance with fair value measurement and disclosure guidance, the objective of a fair value measurement is to determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date based on the principal or, in the absence of a principal, most advantageous market for the specific asset or liability. The disclosure guidance establishes a three-level hierarchy of inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to the measurement of fair value based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1), followed by the measurement of fair value based on pricing models with significant observable inputs (Level 2), with the lowest priority given to the measurement of fair value based on pricing models with significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). The Company does not have any Level 3 assets measured on a recurring basis. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Investment Securities

The Company’s investment securities are mostly composed of fixed-income securities issued by states and municipalities as well as the U.S. Government and Agencies.

The fair market values for the Company’s investment securities, including investments comprising defined benefit pension plan assets, are obtained primarily from pricing services engaged by the Company. For each security, the Company receives one price from a pricing service. The fair values provided by the pricing services are estimated using pricing models, where the inputs to those models are based on observable market inputs or recent trades of similar securities. The pricing services did not apply any adjustments to the pricing models used as of December 31, 2012 and 2011. In addition, the Company did not apply any adjustments to prices received from the pricing services. The Company reaffirms its understanding of the valuation techniques used by its pricing services at least annually. In addition, the Company corroborates the prices provided by its pricing services for reasonableness by comparing the prices from the respective pricing services to valuations obtained from different pricing sources as well as comparing prices to the sale prices received from sold securities at least quarterly.

In the measurement of fair value for the Company’s investment securities, even though the underlying inputs used in the pricing models are directly observable from active markets or recent trades of similar securities in inactive markets, the pricing models do entail a certain amount of subjectivity and therefore differing judgments in how the underlying inputs are modeled could result in different estimates of fair value.

Other-Than-Temporary Impairment of Investment Securities

Realized losses are recognized when management determines that a decline in the fair value of investment securities is other-than-temporary. Such determination requires judgment regarding the amount and timing of recovery. The Company reviews and evaluates its investment securities at least quarterly, and more often as market conditions may require, to identify investment securities that have indications of other-than-temporary impairments. The Company considers several factors when evaluating debt securities for other-than-temporary impairment, including the determination of the extent to which a decline in the fair value of a security is due to increased default risk for the specific issuer or market interest rate risk. With respect to market interest rate risk, the Company assesses whether it has the intent to sell the investment securities and whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investment securities before recovery of any unrealized losses.

In determining whether any of the Company’s investment securities are other-than-temporarily impaired, a change in facts and circumstances could lead to a change in management judgment about the Company’s view on collectibility and credit quality of the issuer, or the impact of market interest rates on the investment securities. Any such changes could result in the Company recognizing an other-than-temporary impairment loss through earnings.

Derivative Instruments

The Company’s primary derivative instruments are interest rate swaps, foreign currency forward agreements, cross-currency swaps and a total return swap relating to a foreign equity investment.

The fair value of the Company’s derivative instruments is estimated by using either a third-party valuation service that uses proprietary pricing models, or by internal pricing models, where the inputs to those models are readily observable from actively quoted markets. The Company reaffirms its understanding of the valuation techniques used by a third-party valuation service at least annually.

To mitigate credit risk arising from the Company’s derivative instruments, counterparties are required to be pre-approved and rated as investment grade. In addition, the Company manages certain counterparty credit risks by exchanging cash and noncash collateral under executed credit support agreements. The noncash collateral does not reduce the derivative balance reflected in the other assets line but effectively reduces risk exposure as it is available in the event of counterparty default. Based on the assessment of credit risk of the Company’s derivative counterparties, the Company does not have derivative positions that warrant credit valuation adjustments.

In the measurement of fair value for the Company’s derivative instruments, although the underlying inputs used in the pricing models are readily observable from actively quoted markets, the pricing models do entail a certain amount of subjectivity and, therefore, differing judgments in how the underlying inputs are modeled could result in different estimates of fair value.

GOODWILL RECOVERABILITY

Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost of an acquired company over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or when events or circumstances arise, such as adverse changes in the business climate, that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value.

The Company assigns goodwill to its reporting units for the purpose of impairment testing. A reporting unit is defined as either an operating segment or a business that is one level below an operating segment for which discrete financial information is regularly reviewed by the operating segment manager.

The goodwill impairment test utilizes a two-step approach. The first step in the impairment test identifies whether there is potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value

 

19

Table of Contents
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY

2012 FINANCIAL REVIEW

 

of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the second step of the impairment test is required to measure any impairment loss.

The Company uses a combination of discounted cash flow methods and market multiples valuation methods in estimating the fair value of its reporting units.

When using discounted cash flow models, the Company estimates future cash flows using the reporting unit’s internal five-year forecast and a terminal value calculated using a growth rate that management believes is appropriate in light of current and expected future economic conditions. The Company then applies a discount rate to discount these future cash flows to arrive at a net present value, which represents the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. The discount rate applied approximates the Company’s expected cost of equity financing, determined using a capital asset pricing model.

The fair value of each of the Company’s reporting units exceeds the carrying value; accordingly, the Company has concluded goodwill is not impaired as of December 31, 2012. The Company could be exposed to increased risk of goodwill impairment if future operating results or macroeconomic conditions differ significantly from management’s current assumptions.

INCOME TAXES

The Company is subject to the income tax laws of the United States, its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which the Company operates. These tax laws are complex, and the manner in which they apply to the taxpayer’s facts is sometimes open to interpretation. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, the Company must make judgments about the application of inherently complex tax laws.

Unrecognized Tax Benefits

The Company establishes a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which are the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit recognized in the financial statements.

In establishing a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit, assumptions may be made in determining whether, and the extent to which, a tax position should be sustained. A tax position is recognized only when it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority based on its technical merits. The amount of tax benefit recognized is the largest benefit that management believes is more likely than not to be realized on ultimate settlement. As new information becomes available, the Company evaluates its tax positions, and adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits, as appropriate.

Tax benefits ultimately realized can differ from amounts previously recognized due to uncertainties, with any such differences generally impacting the provision for income tax.

Deferred Tax Asset Realization

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.

Since deferred taxes measure the future tax effects of items recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements, certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making this assessment, management analyzes and estimates the impact of future taxable income, reversing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies. These assessments are performed quarterly, taking into account any new information.

Changes in facts or circumstances can lead to changes in the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets due to uncertainties.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Refer to the “Glossary of Selected Terminology” for the definitions of certain key terms and related information appearing in the tables within this section.

Beginning the first quarter of 2012, the Company revised the income statement reporting of annual membership card fees on lending products, increasing net card fees and reducing interest on loans. Amounts presented in prior periods for this item and certain other amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. This change has no impact on total revenues net of interest expense in the consolidated statements of income or the net interest yield on cardmember loans statistic, a non-GAAP measure, as reported in the Company’s selected statistical tables.

(a)	Average basic cardmember spending and average fee per card are computed from proprietary card activities only. Average fee per card is computed based on net card fees, including the amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs divided by average worldwide proprietary cards-in-force. The adjusted average fee per card, which is a non-GAAP measure, is computed in the same manner, but excludes amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs. The amount of amortization excluded was $257 million, $219 million and $207 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company presents adjusted average fee per card because the Company believes this metric presents a useful indicator of card fee pricing across a range of its proprietary card products.

(a)	Provisions for principal (resulting from authorized transactions) and fee reserve components.
(b)	Provisions for unauthorized transactions.
(c)	Consists of principal (resulting from authorized transactions) interest and/or fees, less recoveries.
(d)	For cardmember receivables, includes net write-offs resulting from unauthorized transactions of $(141) million, $(161) million and $(148) million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively; foreign currency translation adjustments of $2 million, $(2) million and $1 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively; cardmember bankruptcy reserves of $18 million, nil and nil for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively; and other items of $9 million, $5 million and $(10) million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. For cardmember loans, includes net write-offs for unauthorized transactions of $(116) million, $(103) million and $(78) million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively; foreign currency translation adjustments of $7 million, $(2) million and $23 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively; cardmember bankruptcy reserves of $4 million, nil and nil for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively; and other items of $(10) million, $1 million and $(6) million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Cardmember bankruptcy reserves were classified as other liabilities in prior periods.
(e)	The Company presents a net write-off rate based on principal losses only (i.e., excluding interest and/or fees) to be consistent with industry convention. In addition, because the Company’s practice is to include uncollectible interest and/or fees as part of its total provision for losses, a net write-off rate including principal, interest and/or fees is also presented.
(f)	Upon the adoption of accounting standards related to transfers of financial assets and consolidation of VIEs, which resulted in the consolidation of the American Express Credit Account Master Trust beginning January 1, 2010, $29.0 billion of additional cardmember loans along with a $2.5 billion loan loss reserve were recorded on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.
(g)	Refer to the following table for the calculation of net interest yield on cardmember loans, a non-GAAP measure, net interest income divided by average loans, a GAAP measure, and the Company’s rationale for presenting net interest yield on cardmember loans.

(a)	Net interest yield on cardmember loans, adjusted net interest income, and adjusted average loans are non-GAAP measures. The Company believes adjusted net interest income and adjusted average loans are useful to investors because they are components of net interest yield on cardmember loans, which provides a measure of profitability of the Company’s cardmember loan portfolio.
CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012

The Company’s consolidated income from continuing operations decreased $417 million or 9 percent, and diluted EPS from continuing operations decreased by $0.20, in 2012 as compared to the prior year. Consolidated income from continuing operations increased $842 million or 21 percent, and diluted EPS from continuing operations increased by $0.74, in 2011 as compared to the prior year.

Consolidated net income for 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $4.5 billion, $4.9 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively. Net income included income from discontinued operations of nil, $36 million and nil for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

The Company’s total revenues net of interest expense, total expenses and total provisions for losses increased approximately 5 percent, 6 percent and 79 percent, respectively, in 2012 as compared to the prior year.

The Company’s total revenues net of interest expense and total expenses increased by approximately 9 percent and 13 percent, respectively, while total provisions for losses decreased by 50 percent in 2011 as compared to the prior year.

Results from continuing operations for 2012 included:

 

•	 	
$461 million ($328 million after-tax) of net charges for costs related to the Company’s reengineering initiatives, including a $400 million ($287 million after-tax) restructuring charge in the fourth quarter;

 

•	 	
A $342 million ($212 million after-tax) expense reflecting enhancements to the process that estimates future redemptions of Membership Rewards points by U.S. cardmembers;

 

•	 	
A $153 million ($95 million after-tax) charge related to cardmember reimbursements in the fourth quarter, in addition to amounts incurred in prior quarters during the year; and

 

•	 	
A $146 million tax benefit related to the realization of certain foreign tax credits.

Results from continuing operations for 2011 included:

 

•	 	
$300 million and $280 million ($186 million and $172 million after-tax) related to the MasterCard and Visa litigation settlements, respectively;

 

•	 	
A $188 million ($117 million after-tax) expense reflecting enhancements to the process that estimates future redemptions of Membership Rewards points by U.S. cardmembers;

 

•	 	
$153 million ($106 million after-tax) of net charges for costs related to the Company’s reengineering initiatives; and

Results from continuing operations for 2010 included:

 

•	 	
$600 million and $280 million ($372 million and $172 million after-tax) related to the MasterCard and Visa litigation settlements, respectively; and

 

•	 	
$127 million ($83 million after-tax) of net charges for costs related to the Company’s reengineering initiatives.

Total Revenues Net of Interest Expense

Consolidated total revenues net of interest expense increased $1.6 billion or 5 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, reflecting increases of 7 percent in Global Network & Merchant Services (GNMS), 6 percent in U.S. Card Services (USCS), 3 percent in Global Commercial Services (GCS) and 1 percent in International Card Services (ICS). The increase in total revenues net of interest expense primarily reflects higher discount revenues, higher other revenues and higher net interest income. Consolidated total revenues net of interest expense increased $2.4 billion or 9 percent in 2011 as compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting higher discount revenues, increased other commissions and fees, greater travel commissions and fees, higher net card fees, and higher other revenues, partially offset by lower net interest income.

Discount revenue increased $1.0 billion or 6 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to an 8 percent increase in worldwide billed business volumes, partially offset by a decline in the average discount rate and higher contra-revenue

items, including cash rebate rewards and corporate client incentives. Discount revenue increased $1.9 billion or 12 percent in 2011 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a 15 percent increase in worldwide billed business, partially offset by a slightly lower average discount rate. The lower revenue growth versus total billed business growth reflects the relatively faster growth in billed business related to GNS, where discount revenue is shared with card-issuing partners, and higher contra-revenue items, including cash rewards, corporate incentive payments and partner payments. The 15 percent increase in worldwide billed business in 2011 reflected an increase in proprietary billed business of 13 percent. The average discount rate was 2.52 percent and 2.54 percent for 2012 and 2011, respectively. Over time, certain pricing initiatives, changes in the mix of spending by location and industry, an increase in the amount of prepaid products and volume-related pricing discounts and strategic investments will likely result in further erosion of the average discount rate.

U.S. billed business and billed business outside the United States increased 9 percent and 7 percent, respectively, in 2012 as compared to the prior year, reflecting increases in average spending per proprietary basic card and basic cards-in-force.

Travel commissions and fees decreased $31 million or 2 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a 1 percent decline in worldwide travel sales. Business travel sales declined 4 percent, while U.S. consumer travel sales increased 12 percent. Travel commissions and fees increased $198 million or 11 percent in 2011 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a 13 percent increase in worldwide travel sales.

Other commissions and fees increased $48 million or 2 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, driven primarily by higher fee revenues from the Loyalty Partner business. Assuming no changes in foreign exchange rates, other commissions and fees increased 5 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year.1 Other commissions and fees increased $238 million or 12 percent in 2011 as compared to the prior year, primarily driven by fee revenues from the Loyalty Partner business.

Other revenues increased $288 million or 13 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting higher gains on the sale of investment securities, higher GNS partner royalty revenues, and the favorable effects of revised estimates in the liability for uncashed Travelers Cheques in international markets. Other revenues increased $237 million or 12 percent in 2011 as compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting higher royalties from GNS partners, a contractual payment from a GNS partner and greater merchant-related fee revenues.

Interest income increased $158 million or 2 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year. Interest on loans increased $239 million or 4 percent, primarily reflecting higher average cardmember loans. Interest and dividends on investment securities decreased $81 million or 25 percent, primarily reflecting decreased levels of investment securities. Interest on deposits with banks and other remained flat year over year. Interest income decreased $377 million or 5 percent in 2011 as compared to the prior year. Interest on loans decreased $292 million or 4 percent, driven by a lower net yield on cardmember loans, partially offset by a slight increase in average cardmember loans. Interest and dividends on investment securities decreased $116 million or 26 percent, primarily reflecting decreased levels of investment securities. Interest on deposits with banks and other increased $31 million or 47 percent, primarily due to higher average deposit balances.

Interest expense decreased $94 million or 4 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year. Interest on deposits decreased $48 million or 9 percent, primarily due to a lower cost of funds, partially offset by an increase in average customer deposit balances. Interest on long-term debt and other decreased $46 million or 3 percent, reflecting a lower average long-term debt balance. Interest expense decreased $103 million or 4 percent in 2011 as compared to the prior year. Interest on deposits

Provisions for Losses

Provisions for losses increased $878 million or 79 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year. Charge card provisions for losses decreased $28 million or 4 percent, primarily due to a net reserve release in 2012 compared to a reserve build in 2011. Cardmember loans provisions for losses increased $896 million or over 100 percent, primarily reflecting a smaller reserve release in 2012 than in 2011 due to the slowing pace of improved credit conditions. Other provisions for losses increased $10 million or 11 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year.

Provisions for losses decreased $1.1 billion or 50 percent in 2011 as compared to the prior year. Charge card provisions for losses increased $175 million or 29 percent, primarily driven by higher average cardmember receivables, higher net write-offs and a release of reserves in the prior year due to improved credit performance. Cardmember loans provisions for losses decreased $1.3 billion or 83 percent, primarily reflecting lower net write-offs and a lower cardmember loan reserve requirement in 2011 as compared to the prior year. Other provisions for losses increased $4 million or 5 percent in 2011 as compared to the prior year.

Expenses

Consolidated expenses increased $1.2 billion or 6 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year. The increase reflects higher other expenses, higher salaries and employee benefits costs, higher occupancy and equipment expenses and higher cardmember services expenses, partially offset by lower marketing and promotion expenses. Consolidated expenses increased $2.5 billion or 13 percent in 2011 as compared to the prior year. The increase reflected higher cardmember rewards expenses, salaries and employee benefits costs, other expenses, cardmember services expenses, professional services expenses and occupancy and equipment expenses, partially offset by lower marketing and promotion expenses. Consolidated expenses in 2012, 2011 and 2010 also included $461 million, $153 million and $127 million, respectively, of reengineering costs, of which $403 million, $119 million and $96 million, respectively, represent restructuring charges.

Marketing and promotion expenses decreased $106 million or 4 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting lower loyalty and brand spending. Marketing and promotion expenses decreased $151 million or 5 percent in 2011 as compared to the prior year, due to lower product media and brand spending. Marketing and promotion spending represented 9.2 percent of total revenues in 2012 as compared to 10.0 percent and 11.4 percent of total revenues in 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Cardmember rewards expenses increased $64 million or 1 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year due to an increase

in co-brand rewards expense of $148 million partially offset by a decrease in Membership Rewards expense of $84 million.

For 2012, co-brand rewards expenses increased $148 million primarily related to higher spending volumes. Membership Rewards expenses decreased $84 million as compared to the prior year as a result of a $353 million reduction in expenses related to a slower average URR growth rate (including the effects of enhancements to the U.S. URR estimation process of $342 million in 2012 and $188 million in 2011) and a shift in the redemption mix that drove a favorable change in the WAC assumption, offset by higher expenses of $269 million relating to an increase in new points earned.

For 2011, Membership Rewards expenses increased $920 million as compared to the prior year as a result of higher expenses of $558 million related to an increase in new points earned, a $362 million increase in expenses related to a higher average URR growth rate (including the effects of enhancements to the U.S. URR estimation process of $188 million) in addition to a shift in the redemption mix resulting in a higher WAC assumption. Co-brand rewards expenses increased $298 million primarily related to higher spending volumes.

The Company’s Membership Rewards URR for current participants was 94 percent (rounded up) at December 31, 2012, an increase from 92 percent (rounded down) at December 31, 2011 and 91 percent (rounded up) in 2010. The increases in the ultimate redemption rate are a result of cardmembers’ increased engagement with the Company’s Membership Rewards program.

Cardmember services expenses increased $83 million or 12 percent and $125 million or 21 percent in 2012 and 2011, respectively, as compared to the prior year, driven by increases in the costs associated with enhanced benefits to U.S. cardmembers.

Salaries and employee benefits expenses increased $345 million or 6 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting higher restructuring costs in 2012. Salaries and employee benefits expenses increased $686 million or 12 percent in 2011 as compared to the prior year, reflecting higher employee levels, merit increases for existing employees, higher employee benefits costs and higher incentive-related compensation.

Other, net increased $861 million or 15 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting the absence of the benefits of the Visa and MasterCard litigation settlement payments that ceased in the fourth quarter 2011. In addition, the increase includes higher costs associated with cardmember reimbursements of $143 million, as well as impairment of certain cost method investments. Other, net also includes occupancy and equipment expenses, which also increased, reflecting higher data processing expenses. Other, net increased $460 million or 20 percent in 2011 as compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting $300 million of MasterCard settlement payments received in 2010 that ceased in the second quarter of 2011. In addition, higher other expenses are driven by costs associated with Loyalty Partner expenses following the closing of the acquisition in the first quarter of 2011, data processing and software amortization expense, as well as lease termination costs. Other, net also includes an increase in 2011 as compared to 2010 in professional services expenses related to higher technology development expenditures including various initiatives related to digitizing the business, globalizing operating platforms and enhancing analytical data and capabilities. Higher legal costs and third-party merchant sales-force commissions also contributed to the increase.

Income Taxes

The effective tax rate on continuing operations was 30.5 percent, 29.6 percent and 32.0 percent in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The tax rates for 2012 and 2011 included benefits of $146 million and $77 million, respectively, related to the realization of certain foreign tax credits. The tax rate for 2011 also included a benefit of $102 million related to the resolution of certain prior years’ tax items. In addition, the tax rates in all years reflected the level of pretax income in relation to recurring permanent tax benefits and geographic mix of business.

CASH FLOWS

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

Cash flows from operating activities primarily include net income adjusted for (i) non-cash items included in net income, including provisions for losses, depreciation and amortization, deferred taxes, and stock-based compensation and (ii) changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities, which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of various payments.

For the year ended December 31, 2012, net cash provided by operating activities of $7.1 billion decreased $2.7 billion compared to $9.8 billion in 2011. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the liabilities for accounts payable and other liabilities in 2012 as compared to the prior year versus an increase in 2011 as compared to the prior year.

For the year ended December 31, 2011, net cash provided by operating activities of $9.8 billion increased $1.1 billion compared to $8.7 billion in 2010. The increase was primarily due to higher net income in 2011 and increases in other receivables and accounts payable and other liabilities, partially offset by lower provisions for losses and decreases in deferred taxes and other in 2011.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

The Company’s investing activities primarily include funding cardmember loans and receivables and the Company’s available-for-sale investment portfolio.

For the year ended December 31, 2012, net cash used in investing activities of $6.5 billion increased $6.0 billion compared to $0.5 billion in 2011, primarily due to a reduction in maturities, redemptions and sales of investments, and a net decrease in the cash flows related to cardmember loans and receivables and restricted cash, partially offset by lower purchases of investments and fewer acquisitions in 2012 as compared to 2011.

For the year ended December 31, 2011, net cash used in investing activities of $0.5 billion decreased $0.7 billion

compared to $1.2 billion in 2010, primarily due to lower purchases of investments and a decrease in restricted cash, partially offset by lower sales, maturity and redemption of investments and increases in cardmember loans and receivables.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

The Company’s financing activities primarily include issuing and repaying debt, taking customer deposits, issuing and repurchasing its common shares, and paying dividends.

For the year ended December 31, 2012, net cash used in financing activities of $3.3 billion increased $2.6 billion compared to $0.7 billion in 2011, due to a decrease in short-term borrowings, and an increase in the repurchase of common shares in 2012, which more than offset a decrease in principal payments on long-term debt.

For the year ended December 31, 2011, net cash used in financing activities of $0.7 billion decreased $7.2 billion compared to $7.9 billion in 2010, due to increases in customer deposits and issuances of long-term debt during 2011 as compared to 2010, partially offset by increases in principal payments on long-term debt and repurchases of common shares and a decrease in short-term borrowings in 2011.

CERTAIN LEGISLATIVE, REGULATORY AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS

As a participant in the financial services industry, the Company is subject to a wide array of regulations applicable to its businesses. As a bank holding company and a financial holding company, the Company is subject to comprehensive examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve and to a range of laws and regulations that impact its business and operations. In addition, the extreme disruptions in global capital markets that commenced in mid-2007 and the resulting instability and failure and near failure of numerous financial institutions, as well as reports of widespread consumer abuse, led to a number of changes in the financial services industry, including more intense supervision, enhanced enforcement activity, significant additional regulation and the formation of additional regulatory bodies. In light of recent legislative initiatives and continuing regulatory reform implementation, compliance requirements and expenditures have risen for financial services firms, including the Company, and the Company expects compliance requirements and expenditures will continue to rise with continuing implementation of these reforms.

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank), which was enacted in July 2010, is comprehensive in scope and contains a wide array of provisions intended to govern the practices and oversight of financial institutions and other participants in the financial markets. Among other matters, the law created an independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the CFPB), which has broad rulemaking authority over providers of credit, savings, payment and other consumer financial products and services with respect to certain federal consumer financial laws. Moreover, the CFPB has examination and enforcement authority with respect to certain federal consumer financial laws for some providers of consumer financial products and services, including the Company’s insured depository institution subsidiaries. The CFPB is directed to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts or practices, and to ensure that all consumers have access to fair, transparent and competitive markets for consumer financial products and services. The review of products and practices to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive conduct will be a continuing focus of the CFPB and banking regulators more broadly, as well as by the Company itself. The ultimate impact of this heightened scrutiny is uncertain, but internal and regulatory reviews have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, changes to pricing, practices, products and procedures. Such reviews are also likely to continue to result in increased costs related to regulatory oversight, supervision and examination, additional restitution to cardmembers and possible additional regulatory actions which could include civil money penalties. In July 2012, the CFPB issued a bulletin regarding its review of marketing practices with respect to credit card add-on products, including debt cancellation, identity theft protection, credit reporting and monitoring, and other supplementary products. The Company is cooperating with regulators in their ongoing regulatory examination of credit card add-on products. For a description of the settlements reached with, and ongoing reviews by, several bank regulators, including the CFPB, relating to certain aspects of the Company’s U.S. consumer card practices, see “Legal Proceedings” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012.

Dodd-Frank prohibits payment card networks from restricting merchants from offering discounts or incentives to customers to pay with particular forms of payment, such as cash, check, credit or debit card, or restricting merchants from setting certain minimum and maximum transaction amounts for credit cards, as long as any such discounts or incentives or any minimum or maximum transaction amounts do not discriminate on the basis of the issuer or network and comply with applicable federal or state disclosure requirements.

Under Dodd-Frank, the Federal Reserve is also authorized to regulate interchange fees paid to financial institutions on debit card and certain general-use prepaid card transactions to ensure that they are “reasonable and proportional” to the cost of processing individual transactions, and to prohibit payment card networks and issuers from requiring transactions to be processed on a single payment network or fewer than two unaffiliated networks. The Federal Reserve’s rule provides that the regulations on interchange and routing do not apply to a three-party network like American Express when it acts as both the issuer and the network for its prepaid cards, and the Company is therefore not a “payment card network” as that term is defined and used for the specific purposes of the rule.

Dodd-Frank also authorizes the Federal Reserve to establish heightened capital, leverage and liquidity standards, risk management requirements, concentration limits on credit exposures, mandatory resolution plans (so-called “living wills”) and stress tests for, among others, large bank holding companies, such as the Company, that have greater than $50 billion in assets. In addition, certain derivative transactions will be required to be centrally cleared, which may create or increase collateral posting requirements for the Company.

Many provisions of Dodd-Frank require the adoption of rules for implementation. In addition, Dodd-Frank mandates multiple studies, which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action. These new rules and studies will be implemented and undertaken over a period of several years. Accordingly, the ultimate consequences of Dodd-Frank and its implementing regulations on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition are uncertain at this time.

Department of Justice Litigation

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and certain states attorneys general have brought an action against the Company alleging that the provisions in the Company’s card acceptance agreements with merchants that prohibit merchants from discriminating against the Company’s card products at the point of sale violate the U.S. antitrust laws. Visa and MasterCard, which were also defendants in the DOJ and state action, entered into a settlement agreement and have been dismissed as parties pursuant to that agreement. The settlement enjoins Visa and MasterCard, with certain exceptions, from adopting or enforcing rules or entering into contracts that prohibit merchants from engaging in various actions to steer cardholders to other card products or payment forms at the point of sale. If similar conditions were imposed on American Express, it could have a material adverse effect on American Express’ business.

Other Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives

The payment card sector also faces continuing scrutiny in connection with the fees merchants pay to accept cards. Regulators and legislators outside the United States have focused on the way bankcard network members collectively set the “interchange” (that is, the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card-issuing bank in “four-party” payment networks, like Visa and MasterCard). Although, unlike the Visa and MasterCard networks, the American Express network does not collectively set fees, antitrust actions and government regulation relating to merchant pricing could affect all networks.

In January 2012, the European Commission (the Commission) published a Green Paper (a document to begin a process of consultation toward potential regulation) covering a range of issues affecting the payments industry, including interchange fees, non-discrimination and honor-all-cards rules, surcharging, separation of processing from card network management, perceived barriers to cross-border acquiring, mobile payments and technical standardization. The Commission has completed a consultation period and is expected to issue its preliminary conclusions in early 2013. These conclusions may involve proposals for regulation or recommendations for self-regulation and could take up to 18-24 months to adopt and implement.

In certain countries, such as Australia, and in certain member states in Europe, merchants are permitted by law to surcharge card purchases. While surcharging continues to be actively considered in certain jurisdictions, the benefits to customers have not been apparent in countries that have allowed it, and in some cases regulators are addressing concerns about excessive surcharging by merchants. Surcharging, particularly where it disproportionately impacts American Express cardmembers, which is known as differential surcharging, could have a material adverse effect on the Company if it becomes widespread. In June 2012, the Reserve Bank of Australia announced changes to the Australian surcharging standards beginning March 18, 2013 that will allow the Company and other networks to limit a merchant’s right to surcharge to “the reasonable cost of card acceptance.” In the European Union (the EU), the Consumer Rights Directive, which was adopted by the EU Council of Ministers in October 2011, will prohibit merchants from surcharging card purchases more than the merchants’ cost of acceptance. The EU member states have until December 2013 to transpose the directive into national law.

Although neither a legislative nor regulatory initiative, the settlement by MasterCard and Visa in a U.S. merchant class litigation (which has been given preliminary, but not final, approval by the trial court) requires, among other things, MasterCard and Visa to permit U.S. merchants, subject to certain conditions, to surcharge credit cards, while allowing them to continue to prohibit surcharges on debit card transactions.

Also, other countries in which the Company operates have been considering and in some cases adopting similar legislation and rules that would impose changes on certain practices of card issuers, merchant acquirers and payment networks.

2012 FINANCIAL REVIEW

 

CONSOLIDATED CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

The Company’s balance sheet management objectives are to maintain:

 

•	 	
A solid and flexible equity capital profile;

 

•	 	
A broad, deep and diverse set of funding sources to finance its assets and meet operating requirements; and

 

•	 	
Liquidity programs that enable the Company to continuously meet expected future financing obligations and business requirements for at least a 12-month period, even in the event it is unable to continue to raise new funds under its traditional funding programs.

CAPITAL STRATEGY

The Company’s objective is to retain sufficient levels of capital generated through earnings and other sources to maintain a solid equity capital base and to provide flexibility to support future business growth. The Company believes capital allocated to growing businesses with a return on risk-adjusted equity in excess of its costs will generate shareholder value.

The level and composition of the Company’s consolidated capital position are determined through the Company’s internal capital adequacy assessment process, which reflects its business activities, as well as marketplace conditions and credit rating agency requirements. The Company’s consolidated capital position is also influenced by subsidiary capital requirements. The Company, as a bank holding company, is also subject to regulatory requirements administered by the U.S. federal banking agencies. The Federal Reserve has established specific capital adequacy guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items.

The Company currently calculates and reports its capital ratios under the standards commonly referred to as Basel I. In June 2004, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (commonly referred to as Basel) published new international guidelines for determining regulatory capital (Basel II). In December 2007, the U.S. bank regulatory agencies jointly adopted a final rule based on Basel II. The Company has adopted Basel II in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions and is currently taking steps toward Basel II implementation in the United States.

Dodd-Frank and a series of international capital and liquidity standards known as Basel III published by Basel on December 16, 2010 will in the future change the current quantitative measures. In general, these changes will involve, for the U.S. banking industry as a whole, a reduction in the types of instruments deemed to be capital along with an increase in the amount of capital that assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items require. These changes will generally serve to reduce reported capital ratios compared to current capital guidelines. On June 7, 2012, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation issued three joint notices of proposed rulemaking, collectively referred to as Basel III, which presents details of the proposed new U.S. regulatory capital standards. The proposed U.S. rules are generally in line with the aforementioned capital standards published by Basel in 2010.

The following table presents the regulatory risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratio for the Company and its significant bank subsidiaries, as well as additional ratios widely utilized in the marketplace, as of December 31, 2012.

(a)	As defined by the Federal Reserve.
(b)	Refer to page 30 for a reconciliation of Tier 1 common equity and tangible common equity, both non-GAAP measures.
The following provides definitions for the Company’s regulatory risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratio, which are calculated as per standard regulatory guidance, if applicable:

Risk-Weighted Assets — Assets are weighted for risk according to a formula used by the Federal Reserve to conform to capital adequacy guidelines. On- and off-balance sheet items are weighted for risk, with off-balance sheet items converted to balance sheet equivalents, using risk conversion factors, before being allocated a risk-adjusted weight. The off-balance sheet items comprise a minimal part of the overall calculation. Risk-weighted assets as of December 31, 2012 were $125.7 billion.

Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio — The Tier 1 capital ratio is calculated as Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 capital is the sum of common shareholders’ equity, certain perpetual preferred stock (not applicable to the Company), and noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries, adjusted for ineligible goodwill and intangible assets, as well as certain other comprehensive income items as follows: net unrealized

gains/losses on securities and derivatives, and net unrealized pension and other postretirement benefit losses, all net of tax. Tier 1 capital as of December 31, 2012 was $14.9 billion. This ratio is commonly used by regulatory agencies to assess a financial institution’s financial strength and is the primary form of capital used to absorb losses beyond current loss accrual estimates.

Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio — The total risk-based capital ratio is calculated as the sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 2 capital is the sum of the allowance for receivable and loan losses (limited to 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets) and 45 percent of the unrealized gains on equity securities, plus a $750 million subordinated hybrid security, for which the Company received approval from the Federal Reserve for treatment as Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital as of December 31, 2012 was $2.4 billion.

Tier 1 Leverage Ratio — The Tier 1 leverage ratio is calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by the Company’s average total consolidated assets for the most recent quarter. Average total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2012 were $147.0 billion.

The following provides definitions for capital ratios widely used in the marketplace, although they may be calculated differently by different companies:

Tier 1 Common Risk-Based Capital Ratio — The Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio is calculated as Tier 1 common equity, a non-GAAP measure, divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 common equity is calculated by reference to total shareholders’ equity as shown below:

 

(Billions)

  	 	(0.2	) 
 

  	
 

 

 
Total Tier 1 common equity

  	$	14.9	 
The Company believes the Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio is useful because it can be used to assess and compare the quality and composition of the Company’s capital with the capital of other financial services companies. Moreover, the proposed U.S. banking capital standards known as Basel III include measures that rely on the Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio.

Common Equity and Tangible Common Equity to Risk-Weighted Assets Ratios — Common equity equals the Company’s shareholders’ equity of $18.9 billion as of December 31, 2012, and tangible common equity, a non-GAAP measure, equals common equity less goodwill and other intangibles of $4.2 billion as of December 31, 2012. The Company believes presenting the ratio of tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets is a useful measure of evaluating the strength of the Company’s capital position.

The Company seeks to maintain capital levels and ratios in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements; failure to maintain minimum capital levels could affect the Company’s status as a financial holding company and cause the respective regulatory agencies to take actions that could limit the Company’s business operations.

The Company’s primary source of equity capital has been the generation of net income. Historically, capital generated through net income and other sources, such as the exercise of stock options by employees, has exceeded the annual growth in its capital requirements. To the extent capital has exceeded business, regulatory and rating agency requirements, the Company has historically returned excess capital to shareholders through its regular common share dividend and share repurchase program.

The Company maintains certain flexibility to shift capital across its businesses as appropriate. For example, the Company may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements. These infused amounts can affect the capital profile and liquidity levels at the American Express Company (Parent Company) level. The Company does not currently intend or foresee a need to shift capital from non-U.S. subsidiaries with permanently reinvested earnings to a U.S. parent company.

Basel III

Basel III, when implemented by the U.S. banking agencies and fully phased-in, will require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital than prior requirements, with a greater emphasis on common equity. While final implementation of the rules related to capital ratios will be determined by the Federal Reserve, the Company estimates that had the new rules (as currently proposed) been in place during 2012, the reported Tier 1 risk-based capital and Tier 1 common risk-based ratios would have been 11.7 percent, the reported Tier 1 leverage ratio would have been 10.1 percent and the supplementary leverage ratio would have been 8.5 percent.2 These ratios are calculated using the standardized approach as described in the proposed rules and are based on the Company’s reported Basel I ratios, without taking into account the potential impact of Basel II implementation. As noted above, the Company is currently taking steps toward Basel II implementation in the United States.

The estimated impact of the Basel III rules will change over time based upon changes in the size and composition of the Company’s balance sheet as well as based on the U.S.

 

2 	The proposed capital ratios are non-GAAP measures. The Company believes the presentation of the proposed capital ratios is helpful to investors by showing the impact of Basel III, assuming the proposed new rules as currently proposed are implemented by the Federal Reserve.

implementation of the Basel III rules; and the estimated impact for 2012 is not necessarily indicative of the impact in future periods.

The following provides definitions for capital ratios as defined by the proposed U.S. Basel III guidelines using the standardized approach. All calculations are non-GAAP measures.

Basel III Tier 1 Common Risk-Based Capital Ratio — The Basel III Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio is calculated as adjusted Tier 1 common equity divided by adjusted risk-weighted assets.

Basel III Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio — The Basel III Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is calculated as adjusted Tier 1 capital divided by adjusted risk-weighted assets.

The following table presents a comparison of the Company’s Tier 1 and Tier 1 common risk-based capital under Basel I rules to its estimated Tier 1 and Tier 1 common risk-based capital under Basel III rules.

The estimated Basel III Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 common equity could change in the future as the U.S. regulatory agencies implement Basel III or if the Company’s business changes.
Basel III Risk-Weighted Assets — The Basel III risk-weighted assets reflect the Company’s current interpretation of the Basel III rules on the Company’s Basel I risk-weighted assets. Risk-weighted assets include adjustments relating to the impact of the incremental risk weighting applied to deferred tax assets and significant investments in unconsolidated financial institutions, as well as exposures to past due accounts, equities and sovereigns. Basel III risk-weighted assets as of December 31, 2012 were estimated to be $126.8 billion.

Basel III Tier 1 Leverage Ratio — The Basel III Tier 1 leverage ratio is calculated by dividing Basel III Tier 1 capital by the Company’s average total consolidated assets.

Basel III Supplementary Leverage Ratio — The Basel III supplementary leverage ratio is calculated by dividing Basel III Tier 1 capital by the Company’s estimated total assets for leverage capital purposes under Basel III. Estimated total assets for leverage capital purposes includes adjustments for Tier 1 capital deductions, off-balance sheet derivatives, undrawn unconditionally cancellable commitments and other off-balance sheet liabilities. Total assets for leverage capital purposes as of December 31, 2012 based on the Company’s current interpretation of the Basel III rules were estimated to be $173.5 billion.

SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS

The Company has a share repurchase program to return excess capital to shareholders. The share repurchases reduce shares outstanding and offset, in whole or part, the issuance of new shares as part of employee compensation plans.

During 2012, the Company returned $4.9 billion to its shareholders in the form of dividends ($909 million) and share repurchases ($4.0 billion). The Company repurchased 69 million common shares at an average price of $57.56 in 2012. These dividend and share repurchase amounts represent approximately 98 percent of total capital generated during the year. This percentage for 2012 is significantly greater than the on average and over time target to distribute approximately 50 percent of the capital to shareholders as dividends or through the repurchases of common stock. This payout percentage is also higher than most of the other U.S. financial institutions that are required to submit their capital distribution plans to the Federal Reserve for approval. These distribution percentages result from the strength of the Company’s capital ratios and the amount of capital it generates from net income and through employee stock plans in relation to the amount of capital required to support its organic business growth and through acquisitions.

Since the inception of the program in December 1994, the Company has distributed approximately 66 percent of capital generated through share repurchases and dividends on a cumulative basis.

On January 7, 2013, the Company submitted its comprehensive capital plan to the Federal Reserve requesting approval to proceed with additional share repurchases in 2013. The capital plan includes an analysis of performance and capital availability under certain adverse economic assumptions. The capital plan was submitted to the Federal Reserve pursuant to the Federal Reserve’s guidance on dividends and capital distributions. The Company expects a response from the Federal Reserve by March 14, 2013. Additionally, the Company was informed in March 2012 that the Federal Reserve had no objections to the Company’s plan to repurchase up to $1 billion of shares in the first quarter of 2013.

FUNDING STRATEGY

The Company’s principal funding objective is to maintain broad and well-diversified funding sources to allow it to meet its maturing obligations, cost-effectively finance current and future asset growth in its global businesses as well as to maintain a strong liquidity profile. The diversity of funding sources by type of debt instrument, by maturity and by investor base, among other factors, provides additional insulation from the impact of disruptions in any one type of debt, maturity or investor. The mix of the Company’s funding in any period will seek to achieve cost efficiency consistent with both maintaining diversified sources and achieving its liquidity objectives. The Company’s

funding strategy and activities are integrated into its asset-liability management activities. The Company has in place a funding policy covering American Express Company and all of its subsidiaries.

The Company’s proprietary card businesses are the primary asset-generating businesses, with significant assets in both domestic and international cardmember receivable and lending activities. The Company’s financing needs are in large part a consequence of its proprietary card-issuing businesses and the maintenance of a liquidity position to support all of its business activities, such as merchant payments. The Company generally pays merchants for card transactions prior to reimbursement by cardmembers and therefore funds the merchant payments during the period cardmember loans and receivables are outstanding. The Company also has additional financing needs associated with general corporate purposes, including acquisition activities.

FUNDING PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES

The Company meets its funding needs through a variety of sources, including direct and third-party distributed deposits and debt instruments, such as senior unsecured debentures, asset securitizations, borrowings through secured financing facilities and long-term committed bank borrowing facilities in certain non-U.S. regions.

The Company had the following consolidated debt and customer deposits outstanding as of December 31:

The Company seeks to raise funds to meet all of its financing needs, including seasonal and other working capital needs, while also seeking to maintain sufficient cash and readily marketable securities that are easily convertible to cash, in order to meet the scheduled maturities of all long-term funding obligations on a consolidated basis for a 12-month period. Management does not expect to make any major funding or liquidity strategy changes in order to meet Basel III’s Liquidity Coverage Ratio standard.

The Company’s funding plan for the full year 2013 includes, among other sources, approximately $4.0 billion to $10.0 billion of unsecured term debt issuance and $3.0 billion to $9.0 billion of secured term debt issuance. The Company’s funding plans are subject to various risks and uncertainties, such as future business growth, the impact of global economic, political and other events on market capacity, demand for securities offered by the Company, regulatory changes, ability to securitize and sell receivables, and the performance of receivables previously sold in securitization transactions. Many of these risks and uncertainties are beyond the Company’s control.

The Company’s equity capital and funding strategies are designed, among other things, to maintain appropriate and stable unsecured debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies: Moody’s Investor Services (Moody’s), Standard & Poor’s (S&P), Fitch Ratings (Fitch) and Dominion Bond Rating Services (DBRS). Such ratings help support the Company’s access to cost-effective unsecured funding as part of its overall funding strategy. The Company’s asset-backed securitization (ABS) activities are rated separately.

Downgrades in the ratings of the Company’s unsecured debt or asset securitization program securities could result in higher funding costs, as well as higher fees related to borrowings under its unused lines of credit. Declines in credit ratings could also reduce the Company’s borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets. The Company believes the change in its funding mix, which now includes an increasing proportion of U.S. retail deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on the Company’s funding capacity and costs. Downgrades to certain of the Company’s unsecured debt ratings in the last several years have not materially impacted the Company’s borrowing costs or resulted in a reduction in its borrowing capacity.

SHORT-TERM FUNDING PROGRAMS

Short-term borrowings, such as commercial paper, are defined as any debt with an original maturity of 12 months or less, as well as interest-bearing overdrafts with banks. The Company’s short-term funding programs are used primarily to meet working capital needs, such as managing seasonal variations in receivables balances. Short-term borrowings were stable throughout 2012. The amount of short-term borrowings issued in the future will depend on the Company’s funding strategy, its needs and market conditions.

As of December 31, 2012, the Company had no commercial paper outstanding. Average commercial paper outstanding was $0.4 billion and $0.6 billion in 2012 and 2011, respectively.

American Express Credit Corporation’s (Credco) total back-up liquidity coverage, which includes its undrawn committed bank facilities, was 73 percent and 62 percent of its net short-term borrowings as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The undrawn committed bank credit facilities were $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2012.

DEPOSIT PROGRAMS

The Company offers deposits within its American Express Centurion Bank and American Express Bank, FSB (FSB) subsidiaries (together, the Banks). These funds are currently insured up to $250,000 per account through the FDIC. The Company’s ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates is dependent on the Banks’ capital levels. The Company, through the FSB, has a direct retail deposit program, Personal Savings from American Express, to supplement its distribution of deposit products sourced through third-party distribution channels. The direct retail program makes FDIC-insured certificates of deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings account products available directly to consumers.

LONG-TERM DEBT PROGRAMS

During 2012, the Company and its subsidiaries issued debt and asset securitizations with maturities ranging from 3 to 5 years. These amounts included approximately $4.6 billion of AAA-rated lending securitization certificates, $0.6 billion of subordinated certificates and $5.6 billion of unsecured debt across a variety of maturities and markets. During the year, the Company retained approximately $0.4 billion of subordinated securities, as the pricing and yields for these securities were not attractive compared to other sources of financing available to the Company.

2012 FINANCIAL REVIEW

 

ASSET SECURITIZATION PROGRAMS

The Company periodically securitizes cardmember receivables and loans arising from its card business, as the securitization market provides the Company with cost-effective funding. Securitization of cardmember receivables and loans is accomplished through the transfer of those assets to a trust, which in turn issues to third-party investors certificates or notes (securities) collateralized by the transferred assets. The proceeds from issuance are distributed to the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, as consideration for the transferred assets.

The receivables and loans being securitized are reported as assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and the related securities issued to third-party investors are reported as long-term debt.

Under the respective terms of the securitization trust agreements, the occurrence of certain triggering events associated with the performance of the assets of each trust could result in payment of trust expenses, establishment of reserve funds, or in a worst-case scenario, early amortization of investor certificates. During the year ended December 31, 2012, no such triggering events occurred.

The ability of issuers of asset-backed securities relating to cardmember receivables and loans of an originating bank to obtain necessary credit ratings for their issuances has historically been based, in part, on qualification under the FDIC’s safe harbor rule for assets transferred in securitizations. In 2009 and 2010, the FDIC issued a series of changes to its safe harbor rule, including a final rule for securitization safe harbor, issued in 2010, requiring issuers to comply with a new set of requirements in order to qualify for the safe harbor protection. Issuances out of the Lending Trust are grandfathered under the new FDIC final rule. There are two trusts for the Company’s cardmember charge card receivable securitization, the American Express Issuance Trust (the Charge Trust) and the American Express Issuance Trust II (the Charge Trust II). The Charge Trust does not satisfy the criteria required to be covered by the FDIC’s new safe harbor rule, nor did it meet the requirements to be covered by the safe harbor rule existing prior to 2009. It was structured, and continues to be structured, so that the financial assets transferred to the Charge Trust would not be deemed to be property of the originating banks in the event the FDIC is appointed as a receiver or conservator of the originating banks. The Charge Trust II, which was formed in October 2012, was designed to satisfy the criteria to be covered by the FDIC’s new safe harbor rule.

LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT

The Company’s liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of cash, readily marketable securities and contingent sources of liquidity, so that the Company can continuously meet expected future financing obligations and business requirements for at least a 12-month period, even in the event it is unable to raise new funds under its regular funding programs. The Company has in place a Liquidity Risk Policy that sets out the Company’s approach to managing liquidity risk on an enterprise-wide basis.

The Company incurs and accepts liquidity risk arising in the normal course of offering its products and services. The liquidity risks that the Company is exposed to can arise from a variety of sources, and thus its liquidity management strategy includes a variety of parameters, assessments and guidelines, including, but not limited to:

 

•	 	
Maintaining a diversified set of funding sources (refer to Funding Strategy section for more details);

 

•	 	
Maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and off-balance sheet liquidity sources; and

 

•	 	
Projecting cash inflows and outflows from a variety of sources and under a variety of scenarios, including contingent liquidity exposures such as unused cardmember lines of credit and collateral requirements for derivative transactions.

The Company’s current liquidity target is to have adequate liquidity in the form of excess cash and readily marketable securities that are easily convertible into cash to satisfy all maturing long-term funding obligations for a 12-month period. In addition to its cash and readily marketable securities, the Company maintains a variety of contingent liquidity resources, such as access to undrawn amounts under its secured financing facilities and the Federal Reserve discount window as well as committed bank credit facilities.

As of December 31, 2012, the Company’s excess cash available to fund long-term maturities was as follows:

Table of Contents
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY

2012 FINANCIAL REVIEW

 

The Company considers various factors in determining the amount of liquidity it maintains, such as economic and financial market conditions, seasonality in business operations, growth in its businesses, potential acquisitions or dispositions, the cost and availability of alternative liquidity sources, and regulatory and credit rating agency considerations.

The yield the Company receives on its cash and readily marketable securities is, generally, less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances. Thus, the Company incurs substantial net interest costs on these amounts.

The level of net interest costs will be dependent on the size of the Company’s cash and readily marketable securities holdings, as well as the difference between its cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields. Refer also to “Business Segment Results — Corporate & Other.”

Securitized Borrowing Capacity

On August 3, 2012, the Company extended its $3.0 billion committed, revolving, secured financing facility, with an original maturity date in December 2013, to July 15, 2014. This secured financing facility gives the Company the right to sell up to $3.0 billion face amount of eligible AAA notes from the Charge Trust.

On October 3, 2012, the Company entered into a new three-year committed, revolving, secured financing facility maturing on September 15, 2015 that gives the Company the right to sell up to $2.0 billion face amount of eligible AAA certificates from the Lending Trust at any time. Both facilities are used in the ordinary course of business to fund seasonal working capital needs, as well as to further enhance the Company’s contingent funding resources. As of December 31, 2012, $3.0 billion was drawn on the Charge Trust facility and no amounts were drawn on the Lending Trust facility.

Federal Reserve Discount Window

As insured depository institutions, the Banks may borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, subject to the amount of qualifying collateral that they may pledge. The Federal Reserve has indicated that both credit and charge card receivables are a form of qualifying collateral for secured borrowings made through the discount window. Whether specific assets will be considered qualifying collateral and the amount that may be borrowed against the collateral, remain at the discretion of the Federal Reserve.

The Company had approximately $44.2 billion as of December 31, 2012 in U.S. credit card loans and charge card receivables that could be sold over time through its existing securitization trusts, or pledged in return for secured borrowings to provide further liquidity, subject in each case to applicable market conditions and eligibility criteria.

Committed Bank Credit Facilities

In addition to the secured financing facilities described above, the Company maintained committed syndicated bank credit facilities as of December 31, 2012 of $7.7 billion which expires as follows:

 

(Billions)

  		 
2014

  	$	2.1	 
2015

  	 	3.0	 
2016

  	 	2.6	 
 

  	
 

 

 
Total

  	$	7.7	 
The availability of the credit lines is subject to the Company’s compliance with certain financial covenants, principally the maintenance by Credco of a certain ratio of combined earnings and fixed charges to fixed charges. As of December 31, 2012, the Company was in compliance with each of its covenants. The drawn balance of the committed credit facilities of $4.7 billion as of December 31, 2012 was used to fund the Company’s business activities in the normal course. The remaining capacity of the facilities mainly served to further enhance the Company’s contingent funding resources.

The Company’s committed bank credit facilities do not contain material adverse change clauses, which might otherwise preclude borrowing under the credit facilities, nor are they dependent on the Company’s credit rating.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

The Company has identified both on and off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations and other relationships that may have a material current or future effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity and capital resources.

(a)	The above table excludes approximately $1.2 billion of tax liabilities that have been recorded in accordance with GAAP governing the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes as inherent complexities and the number of tax years currently open for examination in multiple jurisdictions do not permit reasonable estimates of payments, if any, to be made over a range of years.
(b)	Estimated interest payments were calculated using the effective interest rate in place as of December 31, 2012, and reflects the effect of existing interest rate swaps. Actual cash flows may differ from estimated payments.
(c)	As of December 31, 2012, there were no minimum required contributions, and no contributions are currently planned, for the U.S. American Express Retirement Plan. For the U.S. American Express Retirement Restoration Plan and non-U.S. defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans, contributions in 2013 are anticipated to be approximately $67 million, and this amount has been included within other long-term liabilities. Remaining obligations under defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans aggregating $729 million have not been included in the table above as the timing of such obligations is not determinable. Additionally, other long-term liabilities do not include $5.8 billion of Membership Rewards liabilities, which are not considered long-term liabilities as cardmembers in good standing can redeem points immediately, without restrictions, and because the timing of point redemption is not determinable.
(d)	The purchase obligation amounts represent non-cancelable minimum contractual obligations by period under contracts that were in effect as of December 31, 2012. Termination fees are included in these amounts.
 

The Company also has certain contingent obligations to make payments under contractual agreements entered into as part of the ongoing operation of the Company’s business, primarily with co-brand partners. The contingent obligations under such arrangements were approximately $4.1 billion as of December 31, 2012.

In addition to the contractual obligations noted above, the Company has off-balance sheet arrangements that include guarantees and other off-balance sheet arrangements as more fully described below.

GUARANTEES

The Company’s principal guarantees are associated with cardmember services to enhance the value of owning an American Express card. As of December 31, 2012, the Company had guarantees totaling approximately $45 billion related to cardmember protection plans, as well as other guarantees in the ordinary course of business that are within the scope of GAAP governing the accounting for guarantees. Refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding the Company’s guarantees.

CERTAIN OTHER OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

As of December 31, 2012, the Company had approximately $253 billion of unused credit available to cardmembers as part of established lending product agreements. Total unused credit available to cardmembers does not represent potential future cash requirements, as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn. The Company’s charge card products generally have no pre-set limit, and therefore are not reflected in unused credit available to cardmembers.

To mitigate counterparty credit risk related to derivatives, the Company accepted noncash collateral in the form of security interest in U.S. Treasury securities from its derivatives counterparties with a fair value of $335 million as of December 31, 2012, none of which was sold or repledged.

Refer to Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion regarding the Company’s other off-balance sheet arrangements.

RISK MANAGEMENT

GOVERNANCE

Risk management and key risks identified by management are overseen by the Company’s Board of Directors and two of its committees: the Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee and the Compensation and Benefits Committee. Both committees consist solely of independent directors and provide regular updates to the Board of Directors.

The Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee approves key risk management policies, and monitors the Company’s risk culture, personnel, capabilities and outcomes. The Committee approves the Enterprise-wide Risk Management Policy along with its sub-policies governing individual credit risk, institutional credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, asset/liability risk and capital management, as well as the launch of new products and services. The Committee receives regular reports about key risks affecting the Company, including their potential likelihood and impact, as well as risk escalation and compliance with the policy-based risk limits. The Committee regularly reviews the credit risk profiles of the major business units, including their risk trends and risk management capabilities. It also reviews enterprise-wide operational risk trends, events and capabilities, with an emphasis on compliance, fraud, legal, information security, and privacy impacts; as well as trends in market, funding, liquidity and reputational risk. The Committee meets regularly in private sessions with the Company’s Chief Risk Officer and other senior management with regard to the Company’s risk management processes, controls and capabilities.

The Compensation and Benefits Committee works with the Chief Risk Officer to ensure that the compensation programs covering risk-taking employees, business units, and the Company overall appropriately balance risk with incentives and that business performance is achieved without taking imprudent risks. The Company‘s Chief Risk Officer is actively involved in the goal-setting process; reviews the current and forward-looking risk profiles of each business unit; and provides input into performance evaluation. The Chief Risk Officer attests to the Compensation and Benefits Committee that performance goals and actual results have been achieved without taking imprudent risks. The Compensation and Benefits Committee uses a risk-balanced incentive compensation framework to decide on the Company’s bonus pools and the compensation of senior executives.

There are several internal management committees, including the Enterprise-wide Risk Management Committee (ERMC), chaired by the Company’s Chief Risk Officer, and the Asset-Liability Committee (ALCO), chaired by the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, which support the Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors in overseeing risks across the Company. The ERMC is responsible for credit, operational and reputational risks, while the ALCO is responsible for market, liquidity, asset/liability risk and capital. In 2012, the ERMC created a dedicated compliance sub-committee.

The Enterprise-wide Risk Management Policy defines risk management roles and responsibilities. The policy sets the Company’s risk appetite and defines governance over risk taking and the risk monitoring processes across the Company. Risk appetite defines the overall risk levels the Company is willing to accept while operating in full compliance with regulatory and legal requirements. In addition, it establishes principles for risk taking in the aggregate and for each risk type, and is supported by a comprehensive system of risk limits, escalation triggers and controls designed to ensure that the risks remain within the defined risk appetite boundaries.

The Policy also defines the Company’s “three lines of defense” approach to risk management. Business Unit presidents are supported by Chief Credit and Lead Operational Risk Officers, who lead the first line of defense. The Global Risk Oversight group (described below) is the second line of defense and provides oversight of risks across the Company that is independent from the first line of defense. The Internal Audit Group constitutes the third line of defense, ensuring that the first and second lines operate as intended.

GLOBAL RISK OVERSIGHT

The Global Risk Oversight (GRO) group provides the Chief Risk Officer with its independent assessment of risks. The GRO seeks to ensure that key risk management policies are consistently implemented and enforced throughout the Company, including risk-based limits and escalations. In addition, the GRO is responsible for aggregation and reporting of risks across risk types, business units and geography and maintains enterprise-wide standards, procedures, tools and processes for managing credit and operational risks. The head of GRO has a solid line reporting relationship to the Company’s Chief Risk Officer.

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT

Credit risk is defined as loss due to obligor or counterparty default or changes in the credit quality of a security. Credit risks in the Company are divided into two broad categories: individual and institutional. Each has distinct risk management tools and metrics. Business units that create individual or institutional credit risk exposures of significant importance are supported by dedicated risk management teams, each led by a Chief Credit Officer. To preserve independence, Chief Credit Officers for all business units have a solid line reporting relationship to the Company’s Chief Risk Officer.

INDIVIDUAL CREDIT RISK

Individual credit risk arises principally from consumer and small business charge cards, credit cards, lines of credit, and loans. These portfolios consist of millions of customers across multiple geographies, occupations, industries and levels of net worth. The Company benefits from the high-quality profile of its customers, which is driven by brand, premium customer servicing, product features and risk management capabilities, which span underwriting, customer management and collections. Externally, the risk in these portfolios is correlated to broad economic trends, such as unemployment rates and GDP growth, which can affect customer liquidity.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY

2012 FINANCIAL REVIEW

 

The business unit leaders and Chief Credit Officers take the lead in managing the individual credit risk process. These Chief Credit Officers are guided by the Individual Credit Risk Committee, which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the Individual Credit Risk Management Policy. This policy is further supported by subordinate policies and operating manuals covering decision logic and processes of credit extension, including prospecting, new account approvals, authorizations, line management and collections. The subordinate risk policies and operating manuals are designed to ensure consistent application of risk management principles and standardized reporting of asset quality and loss recognition.

Individual credit risk management is supported by sophisticated proprietary scoring and decision-making models that use the most up-to-date proprietary information on prospects and customers, such as spending and payment history and data feeds from credit bureaus. Additional data, such as new commercial variables, continue to be integrated into the risk models to further mitigate small business risk. The Company has developed data-driven economic decision logic for customer interactions to better serve its customers.

INSTITUTIONAL CREDIT RISK

Institutional credit risk arises principally within the Company’s Global Corporate Payments, Global Merchant Services, GNS, Prepaid Services and Foreign Exchange Services businesses, as well as investment and liquidity management activities. Unlike individual credit risk, institutional credit risk is characterized by a lower loss frequency but higher severity. It is affected both by general economic conditions and by client-specific events. The absence of large losses in any given year or over several years is not necessarily representative of the level of risk of institutional portfolios, given the infrequency of loss events in such portfolios.

Similar to Individual Credit Risk, business units taking institutional credit risks are supported by Chief Credit Officers. These officers are guided by the Institutional Risk Management Committee (IRMC), which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the Institutional Credit Risk Management Policy and for providing guidance to the credit officers of each business unit with substantial institutional credit risk exposures. The committee, along with the business unit Chief credit officers, make investment decisions in core risk capabilities, ensure proper implementation of the underwriting standards and contractual rights of risk mitigation, monitor risk exposures, and determine risk mitigation actions. The IRMC formally reviews large institutional risk exposures to ensure compliance with ERMC guidelines and procedures and escalates them to the ERMC as appropriate. At the same time, the IRMC provides guidance to the business unit risk teams to optimize risk-adjusted returns on capital. A centralized risk rating unit and a specialized airline risk group provide risk assessment of institutional obligors across the Company.

Exposure to Airline Industry

The Company has multiple important co-brand, rewards and corporate payments arrangements with airlines. The Company’s largest airline partner is Delta Air Lines and this relationship includes exclusive co-brand credit card partnerships and other arrangements including Membership Rewards, merchant acceptance, travel and corporate payments. Refer to Note 22 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of these relationships.

European Debt Exposure

As part of its ongoing risk management process, the Company monitors its financial exposure to both sovereign and non-sovereign customers and counterparties, and measures and manages concentrations of risk by geographic regions, as well as by economic sectors and industries. Several European countries have been subject to credit deterioration due to weaknesses in their economic and fiscal profiles. The Company is closely monitoring its exposures in Italy, Spain, Ireland, Greece and Portugal, which have been determined to be high risk based on the market assessment of the riskiness of their sovereign debt and the Company’s assessment of their economic and financial outlook. As of December 31, 2012, the Company did not hold any investments in sovereign debt securities issued by Italy, Spain, Ireland, Greece or Portugal, and the Company’s gross credit exposures to government entities, financial institutions and corporations in those countries were individually and collectively not material.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS

The Company defines operational risk as the risk of not achieving business objectives due to inadequate or failed processes or information systems, human error or the external environment (i.e., natural disasters), including losses due to failures to comply with laws and regulations. Operational risk is inherent in all business activities and can impact an organization through direct or indirect financial loss, brand damage, customer dissatisfaction, or legal and regulatory penalties.

To appropriately measure and manage operational risk, the Company has implemented a comprehensive operational risk framework that is defined in the Operational Risk Management Policy approved by the Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee. The Operational Risk Management Committee (ORMC) coordinates with all control groups on effective risk assessments and controls and oversees the preventive, responsive and mitigation efforts by Lead Operational Risk Officers in the business units and staff groups. In addition, enhanced processes for issue resolution and customer remediation were implemented in 2012 to strengthen the Company’s commitment to the customer and its focus on quality execution.

The Company uses the operational risk framework to identify, measure, monitor and report inherent and emerging operational

2012 FINANCIAL REVIEW

 

risks. This framework, supervised by the ORMC, consists of (a) operational risk event capture, (b) a project office to coordinate issue management and control enhancements, (c) key risk indicators such as customer complaints or pre-implementation test metrics, and (d) process and entity-level risk self-assessments.

The framework requires the assessment of operational risk events to determine root causes, customer impacts and resolution plan accountability to correct any defect, remediate customers, and enhance controls and testing to mitigate future issues. The impact on the Company is assessed from an operational, financial, brand, regulatory compliance and legal perspective.

COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS

The Company defines compliance risk as the risk of legal or reputational harm, fines, monetary penalties, payment of damages or other forms of sanction as a result of non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations, rules or standards of conduct.

The Company views its ability to effectively mitigate compliance risk as an important aspect of its business model. The Company’s Global Compliance and Ethics organization is responsible for establishing and maintaining the Company’s Corporate-wide Compliance Risk Management Program. Pursuant to this program, the Company seeks to manage and mitigate compliance risk by assessing, controlling, monitoring, measuring and reporting the regulatory risks to which it is exposed.

The Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for approving key compliance policies following their review by the ERMC and for reviewing the effectiveness of the Corporate-wide Compliance Risk Management Program across the Company’s business functions. In addition, the Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee approves the Company’s compliance risk tolerance statement, which reinforces the importance of compliance risk management at the Company.

REPUTATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS

The Company defines reputational risk as the risk that negative public perceptions regarding the Company’s products, services, business practices, management, clients and partners, whether true or not, could cause a decline in the customer base, costly litigation, or revenue reductions.

The Company views protecting its reputation as core to its vision of becoming the world’s most respected service brand and fundamental to its long-term success.

General principles and the overall framework for managing reputational risk across the Company are defined in the Reputational Risk Management Policy. The Reputational Risk Management Committee is responsible for implementation of and adherence to this policy, and for performing periodic assessments of the Company’s reputation and brand health based on internal and external assessments.

Business leaders across the Company are responsible for ensuring that reputation risk implications of transactions, business activities and management practices are appropriately considered and relevant subject matter experts are engaged as needed.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS

Market risk is the risk to earnings or value resulting from movements in market prices. The Company’s market risk exposure is primarily generated by:

 

•	 	
Interest rate risk in its card, insurance and Travelers Cheque businesses, as well as in its investment portfolios; and

 

•	 	
Foreign exchange risk in its operations outside the United States.

Market Risk limits and escalation triggers within the Market Risk and Asset Liability Management Policies are approved by the Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors and ALCO. Market risk is centrally monitored for compliance with policy and limits by the Market Risk Committee, which reports into the ALCO and is chaired by the Chief Market Risk Officer. Market risk management is also guided by policies covering the use of derivative financial instruments, funding and liquidity and investments.

The Company’s market exposures are in large part by-products of the delivery of its products and services. Interest rate risk arises through the funding of cardmember receivables and fixed-rate loans with variable-rate borrowings as well as through the risk to net interest margin from changes in the relationship between benchmark rates such as Prime and LIBOR.

Interest rate exposure within the Company’s charge card and fixed-rate lending products is managed by varying the proportion of total funding provided by variable-rate debt and deposits compared to fixed-rate debt and deposits. In addition, interest rate swaps are used from time to time to effectively convert fixed-rate debt to variable-rate or to convert variable-rate debt to fixed-rate. The Company may change the mix between variable-rate and fixed-rate funding based on changes in business volumes and mix, among other factors.

The Company does not engage in derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Refer to Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s derivative financial instruments.

As of December 31, 2012, the detrimental effect on the Company’s annual net interest income of a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would be approximately $223 million. To calculate this effect, the Company first measures the potential change in net interest income over the following 12 months taking into consideration anticipated future business growth and market-based forward interest rates. The Company then measures the impact of the assumed forward interest rate plus the 100 basis point increase on the projected net interest income. This effect is primarily driven by the volume of charge card receivables and loans deemed to be fixed-rate and funded by variable-rate liabilities. As of December 31, 2012, the

 

39

2012 FINANCIAL REVIEW

 

percentage of worldwide charge card accounts receivable and credit card loans that were deemed to be fixed rate was 67.5 percent, or $74 billion, with the remaining 32.5 percent, or $36 billion, deemed to be variable rate.

The Company is also subject to market risk from changes in the relationship between the benchmark Prime rate that determines the yield on its variable-rate lending receivables and the benchmark LIBOR rate that determines the effective interest cost on a significant portion of its outstanding debt. Differences in the rate of change of these two indices, commonly referred to as basis risk, would impact the Company’s variable-rate U.S. lending net interest margins because the Company borrows at rates based on LIBOR but lends to its customers based on the Prime rate. The detrimental effect on the Company’s net interest income of a hypothetical 10 basis point decrease in the spread between Prime and one-month LIBOR over the next 12 months is estimated to be $34 million. The Company currently has approximately $35 billion of Prime-based, variable-rate U.S. lending receivables and $34 billion of LIBOR-indexed debt, including asset securitizations.

Foreign exchange risk is generated by cardmember cross-currency charges, foreign subsidiary equity and foreign currency earnings in units outside the United States. The Company’s foreign exchange risk is managed primarily by entering into agreements to buy and sell currencies on a spot basis or by hedging this market exposure to the extent it is economically justified through various means, including the use of derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward and cross-currency swap contracts, which can help “lock in” the value of the Company’s exposure to specific currencies.

As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, foreign currency derivative instruments with total notional amounts of approximately $27 billion and $23 billion, respectively, were outstanding. Derivative hedging activities related to cross-currency charges, balance sheet exposures and foreign currency earnings generally do not qualify for hedge accounting; however, derivative hedging activities related to translation exposure of foreign subsidiary equity generally do.

With respect to cross-currency charges and balance sheet exposures, including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding, the effect on the Company’s earnings of a hypothetical 10 percent change in the value of the U.S. dollar would be immaterial as of December 31, 2012. With respect to earnings denominated in foreign currencies, the adverse impact on pretax income of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar related to anticipated overseas operating results for the next 12 months would be approximately $187 million as of December 31, 2012. With respect to translation exposure of foreign subsidiary equity, including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding, a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening in the U.S. dollar would result in an immaterial reduction in equity as of December 31, 2012.

The actual impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate changes will depend on, among other factors, the timing of rate changes, the extent to which different rates do not move in the same direction or in the same direction to the same degree, and changes in the volume and mix of the Company’s businesses.

FUNDING & LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS

Liquidity risk is defined as the inability of the Company to meet its ongoing financial and business obligations as they become due at a reasonable cost. General principles and the overall framework for managing liquidity risk across the Company are defined in the Liquidity Risk Policy approved by the ALCO and Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board. Liquidity risk is centrally managed by the Funding and Liquidity Committee, which reports into the ALCO. The Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining access to a diverse set of cash, readily-marketable securities and contingent sources of liquidity, such that the Company can continuously meet its business requirements and expected future financing obligations for at least a 12-month period, even in the event it is unable to raise new funds under its regular funding programs. The Company balances the trade-offs between maintaining too much liquidity, which can be costly and limit financial flexibility, and having inadequate liquidity, which may result in financial distress during a liquidity event.

Liquidity risk is managed both at an aggregate Company level and at the major legal entities in order to ensure that sufficient funding and liquidity resources are available in the amount and in the location needed in a stress event. The Funding and Liquidity Committee reviews the forecasts of the Company’s aggregate and subsidiary cash positions and financing requirements, approves the funding plans designed to satisfy those requirements under normal conditions, establishes guidelines to identify the amount of liquidity resources required and monitors positions and determines any actions to be taken. Liquidity planning also takes into account operating cash flexibilities.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS

The Company is a global service company principally engaged in businesses comprising four reportable operating segments: USCS, ICS, GCS and GNMS.

The Company considers a combination of factors when evaluating the composition of its reportable operating segments, including the results reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, economic characteristics, products and services offered, classes of customers, product distribution channels, geographic considerations (primarily U.S. versus non-U.S.) and regulatory environment considerations. Refer to Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of the products and services by segment.

Results of the business segments essentially treat each segment as a stand-alone business. The management reporting process that derives these results allocates income and expense using various methodologies as described below.

Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of a change in classification of card fees on lending products, which impacts the selected income statement and statistical data presented herein for the USCS and ICS segments. This change does not impact the net interest yield on cardmember loans statistic, a non-GAAP measure, for these segments.

As discussed more fully below, results are presented on a GAAP basis unless otherwise stated. Refer to the “Glossary of Selected Terminology” for the definitions of certain key terms and related information appearing in the tables within this section.

TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE

The Company allocates discount revenue and certain other revenues among segments using a transfer pricing methodology. Segments earn discount revenue based on the proportion of merchant business generated by the segment’s cardmembers. Within the USCS, ICS and GCS segments, discount revenue reflects the issuer component of the overall discount revenue; within the GNMS segment, discount revenue reflects the network and merchant component of the overall discount revenue. Total interest income and net card fees are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported.

PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES

The provisions for losses are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported.

EXPENSES

Marketing and promotion expenses are reflected in each segment based on actual expenses incurred, with the exception of brand advertising, which is primarily reflected in the GNMS and USCS segments. Rewards and cardmember services expenses are reflected in each segment based on actual expenses incurred within each segment.

Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses, such as professional services, occupancy and equipment and communications, reflect expenses incurred directly within each segment. In addition, expenses related to the Company’s support services, such as technology costs, are allocated to each segment based on support service activities directly attributable to the segment. Other overhead expenses, such as staff group support functions, are allocated to segments based on each segment’s relative level of pretax income. Financing requirements are managed on a consolidated basis. Funding costs are allocated based on segment funding requirements.

CAPITAL

Each business segment is allocated capital based on established business model operating requirements, risk measures and regulatory capital requirements. Business model operating requirements include capital needed to support operations and specific balance sheet items. The risk measures include considerations for credit, market and operational risk.

INCOME TAXES

Income tax provision (benefit) is allocated to each business segment based on the effective tax rates applicable to various businesses that make up the segment.

(a)	Return on average segment capital is calculated by dividing (i) one-year period segment income ($2.6 billion, $2.7 billion and $2.2 billion for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively) by (ii) one-year average segment capital ($9.0 billion, $8.1 billion and $6.4 billion for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively). Return on average tangible segment capital, a non-GAAP measure, is computed in the same manner as return on average segment capital except the computation of average tangible segment capital, a non-GAAP measure, excludes from average segment capital average goodwill and other intangibles of $379 million, $425 million and $459 million as of December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company believes return on average tangible segment capital is a useful measure of the profitability of its business.
(b)	Refer to “Selected Statistical Information” footnote (e) on page 22.
(c)	Net interest yield on cardmember loans, adjusted net interest income, and adjusted average loans are non-GAAP measures. The Company believes adjusted net interest income and adjusted average loans are useful to investors because they are components of net interest yield on cardmember loans, which provides a measure of profitability of the Company’s cardmember loan portfolio.

2012 FINANCIAL REVIEW

 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012

USCS segment income decreased $88 million or 3 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year. USCS segment income increased $455 million or 20 percent in 2011 as compared to the prior year.

Total Revenues Net of Interest Expense

Total revenues net of interest expense increased $975 million or 6 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, primarily driven by higher discount revenue, increased net interest income, higher other revenues and higher net card fees.

Discount revenue, net card fees and other revenues increased $665 million or 6 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher discount revenue resulting from billed business growth, partially offset by higher contra-revenues primarily related to cash rebates tied to volume growth on cash-back rewards products. Billed business increased 9 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, primarily driven by 6 percent increase in average spending per proprietary basic cards-in-force and 3 percent higher cards-in-force.

Interest income increased $268 million or 5 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a 5 percent increase in average cardmember loans and a slight increase in the net interest yield on cardmember loans.

Interest expense decreased $42 million or 5 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, reflecting a lower cost of funds, partially offset by higher average cardmember receivable and loan balances.

Total revenues net of interest expense increased $609 million or 4 percent in 2011 as compared to the prior year, due to higher discount revenue, net card fees and other revenues and a decrease in interest expense, partially offset by a decrease in interest income.

Provisions for Losses

Provisions for losses increased $742 million or over 100 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting a smaller reserve release in 2012 than in 2011 due to the slowing pace of improved credit conditions. The provisions for losses increase was partially offset by lower net write-offs due to improved cardmember lending credit trends in the current period.

Provisions for losses decreased $904 million or 57 percent in 2011 as compared to the prior year, principally reflecting lower reserve requirements driven by improving cardmember loan trends, partially offset by a higher charge card provision resulting from higher cardmember receivable balances and a higher net write-off rate.

Refer to the USCS Selected Statistical Information table for the lending and charge write-off rates for 2012, 2011 and 2010.

Expenses

Expenses increased $293 million or 3 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses, partially offset by lower marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses. Expenses included a reengineering net charge of $29 million in 2012, a net benefit of $8 million in 2011 and a net charge of $55 million in 2010. Expenses increased $888 million or 9 percent in 2011 as compared to the prior year, due to increased marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses, and higher salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses.

Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses decreased $41 million or 1 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, due to lower marketing, promotion and rewards expenses, partially offset by higher cardmember services expenses. Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses increased $849 million or 15 percent in 2011 as compared to the prior year, due to higher rewards and cardmember services expenses.

Cardmember rewards expenses decreased $33 million or 1 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year due to a decrease in Membership Rewards expense of $108 million offset by an increase in co-brand rewards expense of $75 million.

For 2012, Membership Rewards expenses decreased $108 million as compared to the prior year as a result of a reduction in expenses related to a slower average URR growth rate (including the effect of enhancements to the U.S. URR estimation process of $317 million in 2012 and $188 million in 2011) and a shift in the redemption mix which drove a favorable change in the WAC assumption, offset by higher expenses relating to an increase in new points earned. Co-brand rewards expenses increased $75 million primarily related to higher spending volumes.

For 2011, Membership Rewards expenses increased $736 million as compared to the prior year as a result of higher expenses related to an increase in new points earned, an increase in expenses related to a higher average URR growth rate (including the effects of enhancements to the U.S. URR estimation process of $188 million) and a shift in the redemption mix resulting in a higher WAC assumption. Co-brand rewards expenses increased $211 million primarily related to higher spending volumes.

Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses increased $334 million or 9 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, primarily driven by higher other operating expenses related to cardmember reimbursement costs as a result of internal and regulatory reviews of the Company’s U.S. banking subsidiaries, an increase in expenses related to hedge ineffectiveness and higher restructuring charges. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses increased $39 million or 1 percent in 2011 as compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting increased salary and employee benefits costs, partially offset by higher reengineering expense in the prior year.

Income Taxes

The tax rate in all periods reflected the benefits from the resolution of certain prior years’ tax items and the relationship of recurring permanent tax benefits to varying levels of pretax income.

(a)	Return on average segment capital is calculated by dividing (i) one-year period segment income ($634 million, $723 million and $537 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively) by (ii) one-year average segment capital ($2.9 billion, $2.8 billion and $2.1 billion for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively). Return on average tangible segment capital, a non-GAAP measure, is computed in the same manner as return on average segment capital except the computation of average tangible segment capital, a non-GAAP measure, excludes from average segment capital average goodwill and other intangibles of $1.4 billion, $1.3 billion and $592 million as of December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company believes return on average tangible segment capital is a useful measure of the profitability of its business.
(b)	Refer to “Selected Statistical Information” footnote (e) on page 22.
(c)	Net interest yield on cardmember loans, adjusted net interest income and adjusted average loans are non-GAAP measures. The Company believes adjusted net interest income and adjusted average loans are useful to investors because they are components of net interest yield on cardmember loans, which provides a measure of profitability of the Company’s cardmember loan portfolio.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012

ICS segment income decreased $89 million or 12 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year. ICS segment income increased $186 million or 35 percent in 2011 as compared to the prior year.

Total Revenues Net of Interest Expense

Total revenues net of interest expense increased $67 million or 1 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher discount revenue, net card fees and other revenues, partially offset by lower net interest income.

Discount revenue, net card fees and other revenues increased $91 million or 2 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher cardmember spending and fee revenues related to Loyalty Partner, higher conversion revenue and higher discount revenue. Assuming no changes in foreign exchange rates, discount revenue, net card fees and other revenues increased 5 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year.3

Billed business increased 4 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting a 2 percent increase in average spending per proprietary basic cards-in-force. Refer to the Consolidated Selected Statistical Information table on page 24 for additional information on billed business by region.

Interest income decreased $48 million or 4 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, reflecting a lower yield on cardmember loans.

Interest expense decreased $24 million or 6 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, reflecting a lower cost of funds.

Total revenues net of interest expense increased $596 million or 13 percent in 2011 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher discount revenue, net card fees and other revenues, partially offset by lower interest income.

Provisions for Losses

Provisions for losses increased $62 million or 23 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, primarily driven by higher cardmember lending provisions due to lower reserve releases in the current period, partially offset by lower charge card provisions and lower cardmember lending net write-off rates.

Provisions for losses decreased $124 million or 32 percent in 2011 as compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting lower reserve requirements due to improving cardmember loan and charge card credit trends, partially offset by a larger charge card provision expense driven by higher average receivable balances.

Refer to the ICS Selected Statistical Information table for the lending and charge write-off rates for 2012, 2011 and 2010.

 

3 	Refer to footnote 1 on page 25 relating to changes in foreign exchange rates.
Expenses

Expenses increased $108 million or 3 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, due to higher marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses and higher salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses. Expenses in 2012, 2011 and 2010 included $63 million, $36 million and $19 million, respectively, of net reengineering charges. Expenses increased $547 million or 15 percent in 2011 as compared to the prior year, due to higher marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses and higher salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses.

Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses increased $70 million or 4 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, driven by higher volume-related rewards costs and co-brand expenses and higher cardmember services expenses, partially offset by lower marketing and promotion expenses. Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses increased $245 million or 15 percent in 2011 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to greater volume-related rewards costs and co-brand expenses and the inclusion of the Loyalty Partner business.

Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses increased $38 million or 2 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher restructuring charges, partially offset by lower other operating expenses. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses increased $302 million or 15 percent in 2011 as compared to the prior year, reflecting the inclusion of Loyalty Partner expenses, as well as increased salary and employee benefits costs.

Income Taxes

The tax rate in all periods reflected the recurring permanent tax benefit related to the segment’s ongoing funding activities outside the United States, which is allocated to ICS under the Company’s internal tax allocation process. The tax rates for 2012 and 2011 also reflected the allocated share of tax benefits related to the realization of certain foreign tax credits, and the tax rate for 2010 reflected a benefit from the resolution of certain prior years’ items. In addition, the tax rate in each of the periods reflected the impact of recurring permanent tax benefits on varying levels of pretax income.

(a)	Return on average segment capital is calculated by dividing (i) one-year period segment income ($644 million, $738 million and $450 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively) by (ii) one-year average segment capital ($3.6 billion for each of the years 2012, 2011 and 2010). Return on average tangible segment capital, a non-GAAP measure, is computed in the same manner as return on average segment capital except the computation of average tangible segment capital, a non-GAAP measure, excludes from average segment capital average goodwill and other intangibles of $1.8 billion at December 31, 2012 and $1.9 billion at both December 31, 2011 and 2010. The Company believes return on average tangible segment capital is a useful measure of the profitability of its business.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012

GCS segment income decreased $94 million or 13 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year. GCS segment income increased $288 million or 64 percent in 2011 as compared to the prior year.

Total Revenues Net of Interest Expense

Total revenues net of interest expense increased $124 million or 3 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher discount revenue, net card fees and other revenues.

Discount revenue, net card fees, and other revenues increased $115 million or 2 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher discount revenue resulting from an increased level of cardmember spending, partially offset by lower travel commissions and fees and other revenues. Billed business increased 8 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, primarily driven by an 8 percent increase in average spending per proprietary basic cards-in-force. Billed business volume increased 11 percent within the United States and 3 percent outside the United States. Assuming no changes in foreign exchange rates, billed business volume increased 7 percent outside the United States.4

Net interest expense decreased $9 million or 4 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, primarily driven by a lower cost of funds, partially offset by increased funding requirements due to higher average cardmember receivable balances.

Total revenues net of interest expense increased $498 million or 12 percent in 2011 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher discount revenue, net card fees, and other revenues and higher interest income, partially offset by higher interest expense.

Provisions for Losses

Provisions for losses increased $60 million or 79 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, reflecting a change in estimate for certain credit reserves that resulted in higher reserve releases in 2011. Provisions for losses decreased $81 million or 52 percent in 2011 as compared to the prior year, driven by improved credit performance within the underlying cardmember receivable portfolio and reserve releases. Refer to the GCS Selected Statistical Information table for the charge card net loss ratio as a percentage of charge volume.

 

4 	Refer to footnote 1 on page 25 relating to changes in foreign exchange rates.
Expenses

Expenses increased $179 million or 5 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, due to higher salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses and higher marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses. Expenses in 2012, 2011 and 2010 included $172 million, $37 million and $32 million, respectively, of net reengineering charges. Expenses increased $227 million or 7 percent in 2011 as compared to the prior year, due to higher marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses and increased salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses.

Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses increased $32 million or 6 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a $25 million charge related to a change in the U.S. Membership Rewards URR estimation process. Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses increased $108 million or 25 percent in 2011 as compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting higher volume-related rewards costs.

Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses increased $147 million or 5 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, primarily driven by higher restructuring charges and other operating expenses. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses increased $119 million or 4 percent in 2011 as compared to the prior year, primarily driven by increased salary and employee benefits costs.

Income Taxes

The tax rates for 2012 and 2011 reflected the allocated share of tax benefits related to the realization of certain foreign tax credits. The tax rate for 2012 also reflected the impact of a valuation allowance primarily from the restructuring charges associated with certain non-U.S. travel operations. In addition, the tax rate for 2010 reflected an increase in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets.

(a)	Return on average segment capital is calculated by dividing (i) one-year period segment income ($1.4 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.0 billion for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively) by (ii) one-year average segment capital ($2.1 billion, $1.9 billion and $1.7 billion for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively). Return on average tangible segment capital, a non-GAAP measure, is computed in the same manner as return on average segment capital except the computation of average tangible segment capital, a non-GAAP measure, excludes from average segment capital average goodwill and other intangibles of $203 million, $209 million and $70 million as of December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company believes return on average tangible segment capital is a useful measure of the profitability of its business.
(b)	Since the third quarter of 2010, for non-proprietary retail co-brand partners, Global Network Services metrics exclude cardmember accounts which have no out-of-store spend activity during the prior 12-month period.

2012 FINANCIAL REVIEW

 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012

GNMS segment income increased $150 million or 12 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year. GNMS segment income increased $268 million or 26 percent in 2011 as compared to the prior year.

Total Revenues Net of Interest Expense

Total revenues net of interest expense increased $329 million or 7 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher discount revenue, net card fees and other revenues and higher net interest income.

Discount revenue, net card fees and other revenues increased $292 million or 6 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year. The increase reflects higher merchant-related revenues, driven by an 8 percent increase in global card billed business volumes, as well as higher GNS revenues.

Interest expense credit increased $19 million or 8 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, in line with higher merchant accounts payable, which are funded primarily through intercompany transfer pricing agreements with card issuers.

Total revenues net of interest expense increased $637 million or 15 percent in 2011 as compared to the prior year, due to higher discount revenue, net card fees and other revenues and a higher interest expense credit.

Provisions for Losses

Provisions for losses decreased $1 million or 1 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year. Provisions for losses increased $14 million or 23 percent in 2011 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher merchant-related debit balances.

Expenses

Expenses increased $90 million or 3 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses, partially offset by lower marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses. Expenses in 2012, 2011 and 2010 included $31 million, $11 million and $18 million, respectively, of net reengineering charges. Expenses increased $233 million or 9 percent in 2011 as compared to the prior year, due to higher salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses.

Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses decreased $11 million or 1 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, reflecting lower marketing and promotion expenses. Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses were flat in 2011 as compared to the prior year.

Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses increased $101 million or 5 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher professional services costs and increases in salary and employee benefits costs, partially offset by other operating expenses. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses increased $233 million or 12 percent in 2011 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to increases in salary and employee benefits costs, greater third-party merchant sales force commissions and higher legal costs.

CORPORATE & OTHER

Corporate & Other had net after-tax expense of $831 million, $535 million and $180 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Net after-tax expense in 2012 reflected an increase in reengineering costs, partially offset by gains on sales of investment securities and the favorable effects of revised estimates of the liability for uncashed international Travelers Cheques. Results in 2011 and 2010 reflected $186 million and $372 million of after-tax income related to the MasterCard litigation settlement, respectively, and $172 million of after-tax income for both 2011 and 2010 related to the Visa litigation settlement. The Company no longer receives payments on the MasterCard and Visa litigation settlements. After-tax costs of $109 million, $49 million and $2 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, were related to the Company’s reengineering initiatives.

Net after-tax expense in 2011 reflected various investment initiatives and expenses related to legal exposures, partially offset by higher global prepaid income.

Net after-tax expense in 2010 reflected higher incentive compensation and benefit reinstatement-related expenses, and various investments in the Global Prepaid business and Enterprise Growth initiatives.

Results for all periods disclosed also included net interest expense related to maintaining the liquidity pool discussed in “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity — Liquidity Management” above, as well as interest expense related to other corporate indebtedness.

OTHER REPORTING MATTERS

ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS

Refer to the Recently Issued Accounting Standards section of Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

GLOSSARY OF SELECTED TERMINOLOGY

Adjusted average loans — Represents average cardmember loans excluding the impact of deferred card fees, net of direct acquisition costs of cardmember loans and certain other immaterial items.

Adjusted net interest income — Represents net interest income attributable to the Company’s cardmember loans portfolio excluding the impact of interest expense and interest income not attributable to the Company’s cardmember loan portfolio.

Asset securitizations — Asset securitization involves the transfer and sale of receivables or loans to a special-purpose entity created for the securitization activity, typically a trust. The trust, in turn, issues securities, commonly referred to as asset-backed securities, that are secured by the transferred receivables or loans. The trust uses the proceeds from the sale of such securities to pay the purchase price for the underlying receivables or loans. The receivables and loans of the Company’s Charge and Lending Trusts being securitized are reported as assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets, while the related securities issued to third-party investors are reported as long-term debt.

Average discount rate — This calculation is designed to reflect pricing at merchants accepting general purpose American Express cards. It represents the percentage of billed business (both proprietary and GNS) retained by the Company from merchants it acquires, prior to payments to third parties unrelated to merchant acceptance.

Basel III supplementary leverage ratio — Refer to the Capital Strategy section under “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity” for the definition.

Basic cards-in-force — Proprietary basic consumer cards-in-force includes basic cards issued to the primary account owner and does not include additional supplemental cards issued on that account. Proprietary basic small business and corporate cards-in-force include basic and supplemental cards issued to employee cardmembers. Non-proprietary basic cards-in-force includes cards that are issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements, except for supplemental cards and retail co-brand cardmember accounts which have no out-of-store spend activity during the prior 12-month period.

Billed business — Includes activities (including cash advances) related to proprietary cards, cards issued under network partnership agreements (non-proprietary billed business), corporate payments and certain insurance fees charged on proprietary cards. In-store spend activity within retail co-brand portfolios in GNS, from which the Company earns no revenue, is not included in non-proprietary billed business. Card billed business is reflected in the United States or outside the United States based on where the cardmember is domiciled.

Capital asset pricing model — Generates an appropriate discount rate using internal and external inputs to value future cash flows based on the time value of money and the price for bearing uncertainty inherent in an investment.

Capital ratios — Represents the minimum standards established by the regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether the regulated entity has sufficient capital to absorb on- and off-balance sheet losses beyond current loss accrual estimates.

Card acquisition — Primarily represents the issuance of new cards to either new or existing cardmembers through marketing and promotion efforts.

Cardmember — The individual holder of an issued American Express branded charge or credit card.

Cardmember loans — Represents the outstanding amount due from cardmembers for charges made on their American Express credit cards, as well as any interest charges and card-related fees. Cardmember loans also include balances with extended payment terms on certain American Express charge card products and are net of deferred card fees.

Cardmember receivables — Represents the outstanding amount due from cardmembers for charges made on their American Express charge cards as well as any card-related fees.

Charge cards — Represents cards that generally carry no pre-set spending limits and are primarily designed as a method of payment and not as a means of financing purchases. Charge cardmembers generally must pay the full amount billed each month. No finance charges are assessed on charge cards. Each charge card transaction is authorized based on its likely economics reflecting a customer’s most recent credit information and spend patterns. Some charge card accounts have an additional lending-on-charge feature that allows revolving certain balances.

Credit cards — Represents cards that have a range of revolving payment terms, grace periods, and rate and fee structures.

Discount revenue — Represents revenue earned from fees generally charged to merchants with whom the Company has entered into a card acceptance agreement for processing cardmember transactions. The discount fee generally is deducted from the Company’s payment reimbursing the merchant for cardmember purchases. Discount revenue is reduced by payments made to third-party card issuing partners, cash-back reward costs, corporate incentive payments and other contra-revenue items.

Four-party network — A payment network, such as Visa or MasterCard, in which the card issuer and merchant acquirer are different entities and the network does not have direct relationships with merchants or cardholders.

Interest expense — Interest expense includes interest incurred primarily to fund cardmember loans, charge card product receivables, general corporate purposes, and liquidity needs, and is recognized as incurred. Interest expense is divided principally into two categories: (i) deposits, which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions and (ii) long-term debt, which primarily relates to

interest expense on the Company’s long-term financing and short-term borrowings, which primarily relates to interest expense on commercial paper, federal funds purchased, bank overdrafts and other short-term borrowings.

Interest income — Interest income includes (i) interest on loans, (ii) interest and dividends on investment securities and (iii) interest income on deposits with banks and others.

Interest on loans is assessed using the average daily balance method for owned loans. Unless the loan is classified as non-accrual, interest is recognized based upon the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the terms of the applicable account agreement until the outstanding balance is paid or written off.

Interest and dividends on investment securities primarily relates to the Company’s performing fixed-income securities. Interest income is accrued as earned using the effective interest method, which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts, fees and other payments, so that the related investment security recognizes a constant rate of return on the outstanding balance throughout its term. These amounts are recognized until these securities are in default or when it is likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled.

Interest income on deposits with banks and other is recognized as earned, and primarily relates to the placement of cash in excess of near-term funding requirements in interest-bearing time deposits, overnight sweep accounts, and other interest bearing demand and call accounts.

Merchant acquisition — Represents the signing of merchants to accept American Express-branded cards.

Net card fees — Represents the card membership fees earned during the period. These fees are recognized as revenue over the covered card membership period (typically one year), net of provision for projected refunds for cancellation of card membership.

Net interest yield on cardmember loans — Net interest yield on cardmember loans is computed by dividing adjusted net interest income by adjusted average loans, computed on an annualized basis. The calculation of net interest yield on cardmember loans includes interest that is deemed uncollectible. For all presentations of net interest yield on cardmember loans, reserves and net write-offs related to uncollectible interest are recorded through provisions for losses — cardmember loans; therefore, such reserves and net write-offs are not included in the net interest yield calculation.

Net loss ratio — Represents the ratio of charge card write-offs consisting of principal (resulting from authorized and unauthorized transactions) and fee components, less recoveries, on cardmember receivables expressed as a percentage of gross amounts billed to cardmembers.

Net write-off rate — principal only — Represents the amount of cardmember loans or USCS cardmember receivables written off consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions), less recoveries, as a percentage of the average loan balance or USCS average receivables during the period.

Net write-off rate — principal, interest and fees — Includes, in the calculation of the net write-off rate, amounts for interest and fees in addition to principal for cardmember loans, and fees in addition to principal for cardmember receivables.

Operating expenses — Represents salaries and employee benefits, professional services, occupancy and equipment, communications and other expenses.

Return on average equity — Calculated by dividing one-year period net income by one-year average total shareholders’ equity.

Return on average segment capital — Calculated by dividing one-year period segment income by one-year average segment capital.

Return on average tangible segment capital — Computed in the same manner as return on average segment capital except the computation of average tangible segment capital excludes from average segment capital average goodwill and other intangibles.

Risk-weighted assets — Refer to the Capital Strategy section under “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity” for the definitions under Basel I and Basel III.

Segment capital — Represents the capital allocated to a segment based upon specific business operational needs, risk measures, and regulatory capital requirements.

Stored value and prepaid products — Includes Travelers Cheques and other prepaid products such as gift cheques and cards as well as reloadable Travelers Cheque cards. These products are sold as safe and convenient alternatives to currency for purchasing goods and services.

Three-party network — A payment network, such as American Express, that acts as both the card issuer and merchant acquirer.

Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio — Refer to the Capital Strategy section under “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity” for the definitions under Basel I and Basel III.

Tier 1 leverage ratio — Refer to the Capital Strategy section under “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity” for the definitions under Basel I and Basel III.

Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio — Refer to the Capital Strategy section under “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity” for the definitions under Basel I and Basel III.

Total cards-in-force — Represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding. Non-proprietary cards-in-force includes all cards that are issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements, except for retail co-brand cardmember accounts which have no out-of-store spend activity during the prior 12-month period.

Total risk-based capital ratio — Refer to the Capital Strategy section under “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity” for the definition.

Travel sales — Represents the total dollar amount of travel transaction volume for airline, hotel, car rental, and other travel arrangements made for consumers and corporate clients. The Company earns revenue on these transactions by charging a transaction or management fee.

Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements, include, but are not limited to, the following:

 

•	 	
the possibility of not achieving the expected timing and financial impact of the Company’s restructuring plan and higher than expected employee levels, which could be caused by factors such as the Company’s ability to mitigate the operational and other risks posed by planned staff reductions, the Company’s ability to develop and implement technology resources to realize cost savings, underestimating hiring needs related to some of the job positions being eliminated and other employee needs not currently anticipated, lower than expected attrition rates and higher than expected redeployment rates;

 

•	 	
the ability to hold annual operating expense growth to less than 3 percent for the next two years, which will depend in part on the Company’s ability to achieve the expected benefits of the Company’s restructuring plan, which will be impacted by, among other things, the factors identified above, the Company’s ability to balance the control and management of expenses and the maintenance of competitive service levels for its customers, unanticipated increases in significant categories of operating expenses, such as consulting or professional fees, compliance or regulatory-related costs and technology costs, the payment of monetary damages and penalties, disgorgement and restitution, the Company’s decision to increase or decrease discretionary operating expenses depending on overall business performance, the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on costs and results, and the level of acquisition activity and related expenses;

 

•	 	
uncertainty in the growth of operating expenses relative to the growth of revenues in 2013 and subsequent years and the possibility that the ratio of total expenses to revenues will not migrate back towards historical levels over time, which will depend on (i) factors affecting revenue, such as, among other things, the growth of consumer and business spending on American Express cards, higher travel commissions and fees, the growth of and/or higher yields on the loan portfolio and the development of new revenue opportunities and (ii) the success of the Company in containing operating expenses, which will be impacted by, among other things, the factors identified in the preceding bullet, and in containing other expenses including the Company’s ability to control and manage marketing and promotion expenses as described below as well as expenses related to increased redemptions or other growth in rewards and cardmember services expenses. Further, in any period, the ability to grow revenue faster than operating expenses and the ratio of total expenses to revenues may be impacted by rapid decreases in revenues that cannot be matched by decreases in operating expenses;

 

•	 	
uncertainty in the amount of marketing and promotion expenses relative to the revenues in 2013 and subsequent years, which will depend on (i) factors affecting revenue, which will be impacted by, among other things, the factors identified in the preceding bullet and (ii) the Company’s ability to control and manage marketing and promotion expenses as described below, the availability of opportunities to invest at a higher level due to favorable business results and changes in macroeconomic conditions;

 

•	 	
changes in global economic and business conditions, including consumer and business spending, the availability and cost of credit, unemployment and political conditions, all of which may significantly affect spending on American Express cards, delinquency rates, loan balances and other aspects of the Company’s business and results of operations;

 

•	 	
changes in capital and credit market conditions, including sovereign creditworthiness, which may significantly affect the Company’s ability to meet its liquidity needs, access to capital and cost of capital, including changes in interest rates; changes in market conditions affecting the valuation of the Company’s assets; or any reduction in the Company’s credit ratings or those of its subsidiaries, which could materially increase the cost and other terms of the Company’s funding, restrict its access to the capital markets or result in contingent payments under contracts;

•	 	
litigation, such as class actions or proceedings brought by governmental and regulatory agencies (including the lawsuit filed against the Company by the U.S. Department of Justice and certain state attorneys general), that could result in (i) the imposition of behavioral remedies against the Company or the Company voluntarily making certain changes to its business practices, the effects of which in either case could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial performance; (ii) the imposition of substantial monetary damages and penalties, disgorgement and restitution; and/or (iii) damage to the Company’s global reputation and brand;

 

•	 	
legal and regulatory developments wherever the Company does business, including legislative and regulatory reforms in the United States, such as Dodd-Frank’s stricter regulation of large, interconnected financial institutions; changes in requirements relating to securitization and the establishment of the CFPB, which could make fundamental changes to many of the Company’s business practices or materially affect its capital requirements, results of operations, or ability to pay dividends or repurchase its stock; actions and potential future actions by the FDIC and credit rating agencies applicable to securitization trusts, which could impact the Company’s ABS program; or potential changes to the taxation of the Company’s businesses, the allowance of deductions for significant expenses, or the incidence of consumption taxes on the Company’s transactions, products and services;

 

•	 	
the ability of the Company to meet its on-average and over-time growth targets for revenues net of interest expense, earnings per share and return on average equity, which will depend on factors such as the Company’s success in implementing its strategies and initiatives, including growing the Company’s share of overall spending, increasing merchant coverage, enhancing its pre-paid offerings, expanding the GNS business and expense management, and on factors outside management’s control including the willingness of cardmembers to sustain spending, the effectiveness of marketing and loyalty programs, regulatory and market pressures on pricing, credit trends, currency and interest rate fluctuations, and changes in general economic conditions, such as GDP growth, consumer confidence, unemployment and the housing market;

 

•	 	
the Company’s net interest yield on U.S. cardmember loans not remaining at historical levels, which will be influenced by, among other things, the effects of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (including the regulations requiring the Company to periodically reevaluate annual percentage rate increases), interest rates, changes in consumer behavior that affect loan balances, such as paydown rates, the credit quality of the Company’s portfolio and the Company’s cardmember acquisition strategy, product mix, cost of funds, credit actions, including line size and other adjustments to credit availability, and potential pricing changes;

 

•	 	
changes in the substantial and increasing worldwide competition in the payments industry, including competitive pressure that may impact the prices the Company charges merchants that accept the Company’s cards and the success of marketing, promotion or rewards programs;

 

•	 	
changes in the financial condition and creditworthiness of the Company’s business partners, such as bankruptcies, restructurings or consolidations, involving merchants that represent a significant portion of the Company’s business, such as the airline industry, or the Company’s partners in GNS or financial institutions that the Company relies on for routine funding and liquidity, which could materially affect the Company’s financial condition or results of operations;

 

•	 	
the actual amount to be spent by the Company on investments in the business, including on marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services and certain operating expenses, as well as the actual amount of resources arising from the restructuring plan the Company decides to invest in growth initiatives, which will be based in part on management’s assessment of competitive opportunities and the Company’s performance and the ability to control and manage operating, infrastructure, advertising, promotion and rewards expenses as business expands or changes, including the changing behavior of cardmembers;

•	 	
the Company’s funding plan for the full year 2013 being implemented in a manner inconsistent with current expectations, which will depend on various factors such as future business growth, the impact of global economic, political and other events on market capacity, demand for securities offered by the Company, regulatory changes, ability to securitize and sell receivables and the performance of receivables previously sold in securitization transactions; and

 

•	 	
factors beyond the Company’s control such as fire, power loss, disruptions in telecommunications, severe weather conditions, natural disasters, terrorism, cyber attacks or fraud, which could significantly affect spending on American Express cards, delinquency rates, loan balances and travel-related spending or disrupt the Company’s global network systems and ability to process transactions.

A further description of these uncertainties and other risks can be found in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 and the Company’s other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
