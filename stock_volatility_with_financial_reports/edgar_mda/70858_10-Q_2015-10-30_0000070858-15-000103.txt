Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 233 Item 6. Exhibits 234 Signature 235 Index to Exhibits 236 2 Table of Contents Item 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This report on Form 10-Q, the documents that it incorporates by reference and the documents into which it may be incorporated by reference may contain, and from time to time Bank of America Corporation (collectively with its subsidiaries, the Corporation) and its management may make certain statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as "anticipates," "targets," "expects," "hopes," "estimates," "intends," "plans," "goal," "believes," "continue," "suggests" and other similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as "will," "may," "might," "should," "would" and "could." The forward-looking statements made represent the Corporation's current expectations, plans or forecasts of its future results and revenues, and future business and economic conditions more generally, and other future matters. These statements are not guarantees of future results or performance and involve certain known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and are often beyond the Corporation's control. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, any of these forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement and should consider the following uncertainties and risks, as well as the risks and uncertainties more fully discussed elsewhere in this report, and under Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in any of the Corporation's subsequent Securities and Exchange Commission filings: the Corporation's ability to resolve representations and warranties repurchase and related claims, including claims brought by investors or trustees seeking to distinguish certain aspects of the ACE decision or to assert other claims seeking to avoid the impact of the ACE decision; the possibility that the Corporation could face related servicing, securities, fraud, indemnity, contribution or other claims from one or more counterparties, including trustees, purchasers of loans, underwriters, issuers, other parties involved in securitizations, monolines or private-label and other investors; the possibility that future representations and warranties losses may occur in excess of the Corporation's recorded liability and estimated range of possible loss for its representations and warranties exposures; the possibility that the Corporation may not collect mortgage insurance claims; potential claims, damages, penalties, fines and reputational damage resulting from pending or future litigation and regulatory proceedings, including the possibility that amounts may be in excess of the Corporation's recorded liability and estimated range of possible losses for litigation exposures; the possibility that the European Commission will impose remedial measures in relation to its investigation of the Corporation's competitive practices; the possible outcome of LIBOR, other reference rate and foreign exchange inquiries and investigations; uncertainties about the financial stability and growth rates of non-U.S. jurisdictions, the risk that those jurisdictions may face difficulties servicing their sovereign debt, and related stresses on financial markets, currencies and trade, and the Corporation's exposures to such risks, including direct, indirect and operational; the impact of U.S. and global interest rates, currency exchange rates and economic conditions; the possibility that future credit losses may be higher than currently expected, due to changes in economic assumptions, customer behavior and other uncertainties; the impact on the Corporation's business, financial condition and results of operations of a potential higher interest rate environment; adverse changes to the Corporation's credit ratings from the major credit rating agencies; estimates of the fair value of certain of the Corporation's assets and liabilities; uncertainty regarding the content, timing and impact of regulatory capital and liquidity requirements, including the adoption of total loss-absorbing capacity requirements; the potential for payment protection insurance exposure to increase as a result of Financial Conduct Authority actions; the possible impact of Federal Reserve actions on the Corporation's capital plans; the impact of implementation and compliance with new and evolving U.S. and international regulations, including, but not limited to, recovery and resolution planning requirements, FDIC assessments, the Volcker Rule and derivatives regulations; impacts of the October 6, 2015 European Court of Justice judgment invalidating the Safe Harbor Data Transfer Framework; the impact of recent proposed U.K. tax law changes, including a reduction to the U.K. corporate tax rate, and the creation of a bank surcharge tax, which together, if enacted, will result in a tax charge upon enactment and higher tax expense going forward, as well as a reduction in the bank levy; a failure in or breach of the Corporation's operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, including as a result of cyber attacks and other similar matters. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Corporation undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that arise after the date the forward-looking statement was made.

Third-Quarter 2015 Economic and Business Environment In the U.S., the economy grew at a moderate pace in the third quarter of 2015, following uneven but accelerating growth in the first half of the year. Capital spending picked up following several weak quarters, while nonresidential construction continued to expand though restrained by oil price declines. In addition, retail spending increased driven by continued strengthening in vehicle sales, solid employment gains and lower energy costs. Residential construction also continued to improve during the third quarter, reflecting low mortgage rates and rising consumer confidence. U.S. Dollar appreciation resumed during the third quarter, adding to consumer purchasing power while restraining export gains. After widening in the first quarter, the U.S. trade gap narrowed slightly in the second quarter before widening again in the third quarter. Unemployment continued to decline in the third quarter of 2015. Payroll gains slowed in the second half of the quarter, and there was little evidence of an increase in wage gains. Energy costs fell, offsetting the second quarter modest rebound. However, inflation was stable, though the core measure remains well below the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) longer-term annual target of two percent. While the Federal Reserve has continued to indicate that it would likely be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, rates remained unchanged during the third quarter, with the Federal Reserve citing restraint on economic activity and downward pressure on inflation stemming from recent global economic and financial developments. Longer-term U.S. Treasury yields moved moderately lower during the quarter as equities weakened. Internationally, the eurozone and Japanese economies continued to be supported by accommodative monetary policies, weaker currencies and low energy costs. Challenges remain in Greece, although recent elections indicated a restoration of some measure of political stability. Meanwhile, rising emigration from the war-torn Middle East posed a new challenge to the eurozone. Despite Asia economic slowdown, growth continued in Japan. Russia and Brazil remained in recession, while economic growth in China slowed, though Chinese equities stabilized and policy easing provided some support to the Chinese economy. Emerging markets in Asia and Latin America were pressured by softer demand from China, as well as low commodity prices. 4 Table of Contents Recent Events Settlement with Bank of New York Mellon On April 22, 2015, the New York County Supreme Court entered final judgment approving the settlement with the Bank of New York Mellon (BNY Mellon). In October 2015, BNY Mellon obtained certain state tax opinions and an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) private letter ruling confirming that the settlement will not impact the real estate mortgage investment conduit tax status of the trusts. The final conditions of the settlement have thus been satisfied, requiring the Corporation to make the settlement payment of $8.5 billion (excluding legal fees) on or before February 9, 2016. The settlement payment and legal fees were previously fully reserved. BNY Mellon is required to determine the share of the settlement payment that will be allocated to each of the trusts covered by the settlement and then to distribute those amounts. For more information on servicing matters associated with the settlement with the BNY Mellon, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Mortgage-related Settlements Servicing Matters on page 54 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Capital Management During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we repurchased approximately $1.6 billion of common stock in connection with our 2015 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) capital plan, which included a request to repurchase $4.0 billion of common stock over five quarters beginning in the second quarter of 2015, and to maintain the quarterly common stock dividend at the current rate of $0.05 per share. Based on the conditional non-objection we received from the Federal Reserve on our 2015 CCAR submission, we were required to resubmit our CCAR capital plan by September 30, 2015 and address certain weaknesses the Federal Reserve identified in our capital planning process. We have established plans and taken actions which we believe address the identified weaknesses, and we resubmitted our CCAR capital plan on September 30, 2015. The Federal Reserve has 75 days to review our resubmitted CCAR capital plan and our capital planning revisions. Following that review, the Federal Reserve may determine that the capital plan is not adequate or the identified weaknesses are not being satisfactorily addressed, and may restrict our future capital actions. As an Advanced approaches institution under Basel 3, we were required to complete a qualification period (parallel run) to demonstrate compliance with the Basel 3 Advanced approaches capital framework to the satisfaction of U.S. banking regulators. On September 3, 2015, we received approval from the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to exit parallel run and begin using the Basel 3 Advanced approaches capital framework to determine risk-based capital requirements beginning October 1, 2015. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015, we will be required to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and risk-weighted assets under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is to be used to assess capital adequacy including under the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. For additional information, see Capital Management on page 56 . 5 Table of Contents Selected Financial Data Table 1 provides selected consolidated financial data for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 , and at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 .

Other companies may define or calculate these measures differently. For more information on these measures and ratios, and a corresponding reconciliation to GAAP financial measures, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 16 . (2) The diluted earnings (loss) per common share excludes the effect of any equity instruments that are antidilutive to earnings per share. There were no potential common shares that were dilutive in the third quarter of 2014 because of the net loss applicable to common shareholders. (3) Balances and ratios do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. For additional exclusions from nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Nonperforming Consumer Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity on page 92 and corresponding Table 49 , and Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity on page 101 and corresponding Table 58 . (4) Net charge-offs exclude $148 million and $726 million of write-offs in the purchased credit-impaired loan portfolio for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $246 million and $797 million for the same periods in 2014 . These write-offs decreased the purchased credit-impaired valuation allowance included as part of the allowance for loan and lease losses. For more information on purchased credit-impaired write-offs, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio on page 87 . n/m = not meaningful 6 Table of Contents Financial Highlights Net income was $4.5 billion , or $0.37 per diluted share, and $13.2 billion , or $1.09 per diluted share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to a net loss of $232 million , or a loss of $0.04 per share, and net income of $1.8 billion , or $0.10 per share for the same periods in 2014 . The results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same periods in 2014 were primarily driven by decreases of $5.7 billion and $15.2 billion in litigation expense, as well as declines in nearly all other noninterest expense categories, partially offset by a decline in net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis, higher provision for credit losses and lower revenue. Included in net interest income on an FTE basis were negative market-related adjustments on debt securities of $597 million and $412 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to negative market-related adjustments of $55 million and $503 million for the same periods in 2014 . Total assets increased $48.5 billion from December 31, 2014 to $2.2 trillion at September 30, 2015 primarily due to higher cash and cash equivalents as a result of strong deposit inflows driven by growth in customer and client activity, as well as continued commercial loan growth. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015 , we returned $3.1 billion in capital to common shareholders through common stock repurchases and dividends. For more information on the increase in total assets and other significant balance sheet items, see Executive Summary Balance Sheet Overview on page 11 . From a capital management perspective, during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 , we maintained our strong capital position with Common equity tier 1 capital of $161.6 billion , risk-weighted assets of $1,392 billion and a Common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 11.6 percent at September 30, 2015 compared to $155.4 billion , $1,262 billion and 12.3 percent at December 31, 2014 as measured under Basel 3 Standardized Transition. The decline in the Common equity tier 1 capital ratio is primarily due to an increase in risk-weighted assets due to the change in the calculation of risk-weighted assets from the general risk-based approach at December 31, 2014 to the Basel 3 Standardized approach, starting in 2015. On September 3, 2015, we received approval to exit parallel run and begin using the Basel 3 Advanced approaches capital framework to determine risk-based capital requirements in the fourth quarter of 2015. Additionally, the Corporation's supplementary leverage ratio was 6.4 percent and 5.9 percent at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 , both above the 5.0 percent required minimum. Our Global Excess Liquidity Sources were $499 billion with time-to-required funding at 42 months at September 30, 2015 compared to $439 billion and 39 months at December 31, 2014 . For additional information, see Capital Management on page 56 and Liquidity Risk on page 68 .

(2) For more information on capital management and the related capital ratios, see Capital Management on page 56 . 7 Table of Contents Net Interest Income Net interest income on an FTE basis decreased $702 million to $9.7 billion , and $828 million to $30.1 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same periods in 2014 . The net interest yield on an FTE basis decreased 19 basis points (bps) to 2.10 percent , and six bps to 2.21 percent for the same periods. The decrease for the three-month period was driven by negative market-related adjustments on debt securities, as well as lower loan yields and consumer loan balances, partially offset by commercial loan growth. Market-related adjustments on debt securities resulted in an expense of $597 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to an expense of $55 million for the same period in 2014 . Negative market-related adjustments on debt securities were due to the acceleration of premium amortization on debt securities as the decline in long-term interest rates shortened the estimated lives of mortgage-related debt securities. Also included in market-related adjustments is hedge ineffectiveness that impacted net interest income. The decrease for the nine-month period was primarily driven by lower loan yields and consumer loan balances, partially offset by lower long-term debt balances, commercial loan growth and a $91 million improvement in market-related adjustments on debt securities. Market-related adjustments on debt securities resulted in an expense of $412 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to an expense of $503 million for the same period in 2014 . For additional information, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Noninterest Income Table 3 Noninterest Income Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 (Dollars in millions) 2015 2014 2015 2014 Card income $ 1,510 $ 1,500 $ 4,381 $ 4,334 Service charges 1,898 1,907 5,519 5,599 Investment and brokerage services 3,336 3,327 10,101 9,887 Investment banking income 1,287 1,351 4,300 4,524 Equity investment income (loss) (31 ) 9 84 1,150 Trading account profits 1,616 1,899 5,510 6,198 Mortgage banking income 407 272 2,102 1,211 Gains on sales of debt securities 385 432 821 1,191 Other income 763 293 1,733 1,111 Total noninterest income $ 11,171 $ 10,990 $ 34,551 $ 35,205 Noninterest income increased $181 million to $11.2 billion , and decreased $654 million to $34.6 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same periods in 2014 . The following highlights the significant changes. Investment and brokerage services income remained relatively unchanged for the three-month period and increased $214 million for the nine-month period primarily driven by increased asset management fees due to the impact of long-term assets under management (AUM) flows and higher market levels, partially offset by lower transactional revenue. Investment banking income decreased $64 million and $224 million driven by lower debt and equity issuance fees, partially offset by higher advisory fees. Equity investment income decreased $40 million and $1.1 billion as the year-ago period included a gain on the sale of a portion of an equity investment and gains from an initial public offering (IPO) of an equity investment in Global Markets . Trading account profits decreased $283 million and $688 million driven by declines in credit-related businesses due to lower client activity, partially offset by strong performance in equity derivatives and improvement in rates, currencies and commodities products within fixed-income, currencies and commodities (FICC). For more information on trading account profits, see Global Markets on page 41 . Mortgage banking income increased $135 million for the three-month period primarily due to improved mortgage servicing rights (MSR) net-of-hedge performance and a lower provision for representations and warranties, partially offset by a decline in servicing fees. Mortgage banking income increased $891 million for the nine-month period primarily due to a benefit in the provision for representations and warranties compared to an expense in the prior-year period, improved MSR net-of-hedge performance and an increase in core production revenue, partially offset by a decline in servicing fees. 8 Table of Contents Other income increased $470 million for the three-month period due to higher gains on asset sales and higher net debit valuation adjustment (DVA) gains on structured liabilities in the current year period. Other income increased $622 million for the nine-month period due to the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above, as well as lower U.K. consumer payment protection insurance (PPI) costs. Provision for Credit Losses Table 4 Credit Quality Data Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 (Dollars in millions) 2015 2014 2015 2014 Provision for credit losses Consumer $ 542 $ 544 $ 1,714 $ 1,351 Commercial 264 92 637 705 Total provision for credit losses $ 806 $ 636 $ 2,351 $ 2,056 Net charge-offs (1) $ 932 $ 1,043 $ 3,194 $ 3,504 Net charge-off ratio (2) 0.42 % 0.46 % 0.49 % 0.52 % (1) Net charge-offs exclude write-offs in the purchased credit-impaired loan portfolio. (2) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as annualized net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans and leases excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option. The provision for credit losses increased $170 million to $806 million , and $295 million to $2.4 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same periods in 2014 . The provision for credit losses was $126 million and $843 million lower than net charge-offs, resulting in a reduction in the allowance for credit losses. The prior-year periods included $400 million of additional costs associated with the consumer relief portion of the settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ). Excluding these additional costs, the provision for credit losses in the consumer portfolio increased compared to the same periods in 2014 as we continue to release reserves, but at a slower pace than in the prior-year periods, and also due to a lower level of recoveries on nonperforming loan sales and other recoveries in the nine-month period. The provision for credit losses in the commercial portfolio increased during the three-month period primarily due to loan growth. The decreases in net charge-offs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 were primarily due to credit quality improvement in the consumer portfolio. We currently expect that, if economic conditions remain unchanged, the provision for credit losses would be generally consistent with present levels through mid-2016. For more information on the provision for credit losses, see Provision for Credit Losses on page 108 . Noninterest Expense Table 5 Noninterest Expense Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 (Dollars in millions) 2015 2014 2015 2014 Personnel $ 7,829 $ 8,039 $ 25,333 $ 26,094 Occupancy 1,028 1,070 3,082 3,264 Equipment 499 514 1,511 1,594 Marketing 445 446 1,330 1,338 Professional fees 673 611 1,588 1,795 Amortization of intangibles 207 234 632 708 Data processing 731 754 2,298 2,348 Telecommunications 210 311 583 1,005 Other general operating 2,185 8,163 6,963 22,775 Total noninterest expense $ 13,807 $ 20,142 $ 43,320 $ 60,921 9 Table of Contents Noninterest expense decreased $6.3 billion to $13.8 billion , and $17.6 billion to $43.3 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same periods in 2014 . The following highlights the significant changes. Personnel expense decreased $210 million and $761 million as we continue to streamline processes, reduce headcount and achieve cost savings. Professional fees increased $62 million for the three-month period primarily due to higher consulting fees related to the CCAR resubmission. Professional fees decreased $207 million for the nine-month period due to lower default-related servicing expenses and legal fees. Telecommunications expense decreased $101 million and $422 million due to efficiencies gained as we have simplified our operating model, including in-sourcing certain functions. Other general operating expense decreased $6.0 billion and $15.8 billion primarily due to decreases in litigation expense which were primarily related to previously disclosed legacy mortgage-related matters and other litigation charges in the prior-year periods. Income Tax Expense Table 6 Income Tax Expense Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 (Dollars in millions) 2015 2014 2015 2014 Income before income taxes $ 6,069 $ 431 $ 18,330 $ 2,545 Income tax expense 1,561 663 5,145 762 Effective tax rate 25.7 % 153.8 % 28.1 % 29.9 % The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 were driven by our recurring tax preference benefits and also reflected tax benefits related to certain non-U.S. restructurings. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2014 was driven by the impact of accruals estimated to be nondeductible, partially offset by recurring tax preference items, the impact of the resolution of several tax examinations and tax benefits from a non-U.S. restructuring. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 was impacted by the recurring preference and other tax benefit items previously mentioned, which more than offset the impact of the non-deductible charges. On July 8, 2015, the U.K. Chancellor's Budget (the Budget) was released, proposing to reduce the U.K. corporate income tax rate by two percent to 18 percent. The first one percent reduction would be effective on April 1, 2017 and the second on April 1, 2020. The Budget also proposed a tax surcharge on banking institutions of eight percent, to be effective on January 1, 2016, and proposed that existing net operating loss carryforwards may not reduce the additional surcharge income tax liability. On October 26, 2015, these and other proposals were passed by the U.K. House of Commons, and they are expected to be fully enacted via Royal Assent before the end of 2015. Enactment would require us to remeasure our U.K. deferred tax assets, which we estimate would result in a charge of up to $300 million. We expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 30 percent in the fourth quarter, excluding unusual items and specifically the recent U.K. tax proposals, and approximately 30 percent for the full-year 2015, including the impact of the recent U.K. tax proposals, but absent other unusual items. 10 Table of Contents Balance Sheet Overview Table 7 Selected Balance Sheet Data (Dollars in millions) September 30 2015 December 31 2014 % Change Assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 170,426 $ 138,589 23 % Federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell 206,681 191,823 8 Trading account assets 180,018 191,785 (6 ) Debt securities 391,651 380,461 3 Loans and leases 887,689 881,391 1 Allowance for loan and lease losses (12,657 ) (14,419 ) (12 ) All other assets 329,198 334,904 (2 ) Total assets $ 2,153,006 $ 2,104,534 2 Liabilities Deposits $ 1,162,009 $ 1,118,936 4 % Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase 199,238 201,277 (1 ) Trading account liabilities 74,252 74,192 Short-term borrowings 34,518 31,172 11 Long-term debt 237,288 243,139 (2 ) All other liabilities 189,796 192,347 (1 ) Total liabilities 1,897,101 1,861,063 2 Shareholders' equity 255,905 243,471 5 Total liabilities and shareholders' equity $ 2,153,006 $ 2,104,534 2 Assets At September 30, 2015 , total assets were approximately $2.2 trillion , up $48.5 billion from December 31, 2014 . The key driver of the increase in assets was increased cash and cash equivalents primarily due to strong deposit inflows driven by growth in customer and client activity. Debt securities increased primarily due to the deployment of deposit inflows. The increase in loans and leases was driven by strong demand for commercial loans, outpacing consumer loan sales and run-off. The increase in securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell was driven by sales and trading activities, partially offset by a reduction in trading account assets. The Corporation took certain actions during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to further optimize liquidity in response to the Basel 3 Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) requirements. Most notably, we exchanged loans supported by long-term standby agreements with Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) into debt securities guaranteed by FNMA and FHLMC, which further improved liquidity in the asset and liability management (ALM) portfolio. Liabilities and Shareholders' Equity At September 30, 2015 , total liabilities were approximately $1.9 trillion , up $36.0 billion from December 31, 2014 , primarily driven by an increase in deposits, partially offset by a decline in long-term debt. Shareholders' equity of $255.9 billion at September 30, 2015 increased $12.4 billion from December 31, 2014 driven by earnings, preferred stock issuances and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) due to a positive net change in the fair value of available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities, partially offset by returns of capital to shareholders through share repurchases, as well as common and preferred dividends. 11 Table of Contents Table 8 Selected Quarterly Financial Data 2015 Quarters 2014 Quarters (In millions, except per share information) Third Second First Fourth Third Income statement Net interest income $ 9,511 $ 10,488 $ 9,451 $ 9,635 $ 10,219 Noninterest income 11,171 11,629 11,751 9,090 10,990 Total revenue, net of interest expense 20,682 22,117 21,202 18,725 21,209 Provision for credit losses 806 780 765 219 636 Noninterest expense 13,807 13,818 15,695 14,196 20,142 Income before income taxes 6,069 7,519 4,742 4,310 431 Income tax expense 1,561 2,199 1,385 1,260 663 Net income (loss) 4,508 5,320 3,357 3,050 (232 ) Net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders 4,067 4,990 2,975 2,738 (470 ) Average common shares issued and outstanding 10,444 10,488 10,519 10,516 10,516 Average diluted common shares issued and outstanding (1) 11,197 11,238 11,267 11,274 10,516 Performance ratios Return on average assets 0.82 % 0.99 % 0.64 % 0.57 % n/m Four quarter trailing return on average assets (2) 0.76 0.54 0.39 0.23 0.24 % Return on average common shareholders' equity 6.97 8.75 5.35 4.84 n/m Return on average tangible common shareholders' equity (3) 10.11 12.78 7.88 7.15 n/m Return on average tangible shareholders' equity (3) 9.84 11.93 7.85 7.08 n/m Total ending equity to total ending assets 11.89 11.71 11.67 11.57 11.24 Total average equity to total average assets 11.71 11.67 11.49 11.39 11.14 Dividend payout 12.82 10.49 17.68 19.21 n/m Per common share data Earnings (loss) $ 0.39 $ 0.48 $ 0.28 $ 0.26 $ (0.04 ) Diluted earnings (loss) (1) 0.37 0.45 0.27 0.25 (0.04 ) Dividends paid 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.05 Book value 22.41 21.91 21.66 21.32 20.99 Tangible book value (3) 15.50 15.02 14.79 14.43 14.09 Market price per share of common stock Closing $ 15.58 $ 17.02 $ 15.39 $ 17.89 $ 17.05 High closing 18.45 17.67 17.90 18.13 17.18 Low closing 15.26 15.41 15.15 15.76 14.98 Market capitalization $ 162,457 $ 178,231 $ 161,909 $ 188,141 $ 179,296 (1) The diluted earnings (loss) per common share excluded the effect of any equity instruments that are antidilutive to earnings per share.

We believe managing the business with net interest income on an FTE basis provides a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. Certain performance measures including the efficiency ratio and net interest yield utilize net interest income (and thus total revenue) on an FTE basis. The efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue, and net interest yield measures the bps we earn over the cost of funds. We also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents an adjusted shareholders' equity or common shareholders' equity amount which has been reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models use both return on average tangible common shareholders' equity and return on average tangible shareholders' equity as key measures to support our overall growth goals. These ratios are as follows: Return on average tangible common shareholders' equity measures our earnings contribution as a percentage of adjusted common shareholders' equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders' equity divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on average tangible shareholders' equity measures our earnings contribution as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders' equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders' equity divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders' equity divided by ending common shares outstanding. The aforementioned supplemental data and performance measures are presented in Tables 8 and 9 . We evaluate our business segment results based on measures that utilize average allocated capital. Return on average allocated capital is calculated as net income adjusted for cost of funds and earnings credits and certain expenses related to intangibles, divided by average allocated capital. Allocated capital and the related return both represent non-GAAP financial measures. In addition, for purposes of goodwill impairment testing, the Corporation utilizes allocated equity as a proxy for the carrying value of its reporting units. Allocated equity in the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting unit. For additional information, see Business Segment Operations on page 25 . Table 10 presents certain non-GAAP financial measures and performance measurements on an FTE basis.

For more information on allocated capital, see Business Segment Operations on page 25 . 18 Table of Contents Net Interest Income Excluding Trading-related Net Interest Income We manage net interest income on an FTE basis and excluding the impact of trading-related activities. As discussed in Global Markets on page 41 , we evaluate our sales and trading results and strategies on a total market-based revenue approach by combining net interest income and noninterest income for Global Markets . An analysis of net interest income, average earning assets and net interest yield on earning assets, all of which adjust for the impact of trading-related net interest income from reported net interest income on an FTE basis, is shown below. We believe the use of this non-GAAP presentation in Table 14 provides additional clarity in assessing our results. Table 14 Net Interest Income Excluding Trading-related Net Interest Income Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 (Dollars in millions) 2015 2014 2015 2014 Net interest income (FTE basis) As reported $ 9,742 $ 10,444 $ 30,128 $ 30,956 Impact of trading-related net interest income (1,034 ) (906 ) (2,870 ) (2,672 ) Net interest income excluding trading-related net interest income (FTE basis) (1) $ 8,708 $ 9,538 $ 27,258 $ 28,284 Average earning assets As reported $ 1,847,396 $ 1,813,482 $ 1,822,720 $ 1,819,247 Impact of trading-related earning assets (421,639 ) (441,661 ) (419,711 ) (449,249 ) Average earning assets excluding trading-related earning assets (1) $ 1,425,757 $ 1,371,821 $ 1,403,009 $ 1,369,998 Net interest yield contribution (FTE basis) (2) As reported 2.10 % 2.29 % 2.21 % 2.27 % Impact of trading-related activities 0.33 0.48 0.39 0.48 Net interest yield on earning assets excluding trading-related activities (FTE basis) (1) 2.43 % 2.77 % 2.60 % 2.75 % (1) Represents a non-GAAP financial measure. (2) Calculated on an annualized basis. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 , net interest income excluding trading-related net interest income decreased $830 million to $8.7 billion , and $1.0 billion to $27.3 billion compared to the same periods in 2014 . The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2015 was largely driven by a negative change of $542 million in market-related adjustments on debt securities. Also contributing to the decline were lower loan yields and consumer loan balances, partially offset by commercial loan growth. Market-related adjustments on debt securities resulted in an expense of $597 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to an expense of $55 million for the same period in 2014 . For more information on market-related adjustments, see Executive Summary Financial Highlights on page 7 . For more information on the impact of interest rates, see Interest Rate Risk Management for Non-trading Activities on page 118 . The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily driven by lower loan yields and consumer loan balances, partially offset by lower long-term debt balances and commercial loan growth. Market-related adjustments on debt securities resulted in an expense of $412 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to an expense of $503 million for the same period in 2014 . Average earning assets excluding trading-related earning assets for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 increased $53.9 billion to $1,425.8 billion , and $33.0 billion to $1,403.0 billion compared to the same periods in 2014 . The increases were primarily in debt securities, cash held at central banks and commercial loans, partially offset by a decline in consumer loans. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 , net interest yield on earning assets excluding trading-related activities decreased 34 bps to 2.43 percent , and 15 bps to 2.60 percent compared to the same periods in 2014 due to the same factors as described above. 19 Table of Contents Table 15 Quarterly Average Balances and Interest Rates FTE Basis Third Quarter 2015 Second Quarter 2015 (Dollars in millions) Average Balance Interest Income/ Expense Yield/ Rate Average Balance Interest Income/ Expense Yield/ Rate Earning assets Interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve, non-U.S. central banks and other banks $ 145,174 $ 96 0.26 % $ 125,762 $ 81 0.26 % Time deposits placed and other short-term investments 11,503 38 1.33 8,183 34 1.64 Federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell 210,127 275 0.52 214,326 268 0.50 Trading account assets 140,484 1,170 3.31 137,137 1,114 3.25 Debt securities (1) 394,420 1,853 1.88 386,357 3,082 3.21 Loans and leases (2) : Residential mortgage 193,791 1,690 3.49 207,356 1,782 3.44 Home equity 79,715 730 3.64 82,640 769 3.73 U.S. credit card 88,201 2,033 9.15 87,460 1,980 9.08 Non-U.S. credit card 10,244 267 10.34 10,012 264 10.56 Direct/Indirect consumer (3) 85,975 515 2.38 83,698 504 2.42 Other consumer (4) 1,980 15 3.01 1,885 15 3.14 Total consumer 459,906 5,250 4.54 473,051 5,314 4.50 U.S. commercial 251,908 1,743 2.75 244,540 1,705 2.80 Commercial real estate (5) 53,605 384 2.84 50,478 382 3.03 Commercial lease financing 25,425 199 3.12 24,723 180 2.92 Non-U.S. commercial 91,997 514 2.22 88,623 479 2.17 Total commercial 422,935 2,840 2.67 408,364 2,746 2.70 Total loans and leases 882,841 8,090 3.64 881,415 8,060 3.67 Other earning assets 62,847 716 4.52 62,712 721 4.60 Total earning assets (6) 1,847,396 12,238 2.64 1,815,892 13,360 2.95 Cash and due from banks 27,730 30,751 Other assets, less allowance for loan and lease losses 293,867 305,323 Total assets $ 2,168,993 $ 2,151,966 (1) Yields on debt securities excluding the impact of market-related adjustments were 2.50 percent , 2.48 percent and 2.54 percent in the third , second and first quarters of 2015 , and 2.53 percent and 2.55 percent in the fourth and third quarters of 2014 , respectively. Yields on debt securities excluding the impact of market-related adjustments are a non-GAAP financial measure. The Corporation believes the use of this non-GAAP financial measure provides additional clarity in assessing its results. (2) Nonperforming loans are included in the respective average loan balances. Income on these nonperforming loans is generally recognized on a cost recovery basis. PCI loans were recorded at fair value upon acquisition and accrete interest income over the remaining life of the loan.

Business Segment Operations Segment Description and Basis of Presentation We report our results of operations through the following five business segments: Consumer Banking , Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM) , Global Banking , Global Markets and Legacy Assets & Servicing (LAS) , with the remaining operations recorded in All Other . Effective January 1, 2015, we realigned the segments with how we are managing the businesses in 2015. For more information on the segment realignment, see Note 18 Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements . We prepare and evaluate segment results using certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional information, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 16 . Table 17 provides selected summary financial data for our business segments and All Other for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same periods in 2014 .

For more information on this measure and for a corresponding reconciliation to a GAAP financial measure, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 16 . The Corporation periodically reviews capital allocated to its businesses and allocates capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. We utilize a methodology that considers the effect of regulatory capital requirements in addition to internal risk-based capital models. The Corporation's internal risk-based capital models use a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment's credit, market, interest rate, business and operational risk components. For more information on the nature of these risks, see Managing Risk on page 55 . The capital allocated to the business segments is referred to as allocated capital, which represents a non-GAAP financial measure. For purposes of goodwill impairment testing, the Corporation utilizes allocated equity as a proxy for the carrying value of its reporting units. Allocated equity in the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting unit. During the latest annual planning process, we made refinements to the amount of capital allocated to each of our businesses based on multiple considerations that included, but were not limited to, risk-weighted assets measured under Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced approaches, business segment exposures and risk profile, and strategic plans. As a result of this process, in the first quarter of 2015, we adjusted the amount of capital being allocated to our business segments, primarily LAS .

Consumer Banking, which is comprised of Deposits and Consumer Lending, offers a diversified range of credit, banking and investment products and services to consumers and small businesses. Our customers and clients have access to a franchise network that stretches coast to coast through 33 states and the District of Columbia. The franchise network includes approximately 4,700 financial centers, 16,100 ATMs, nationwide call centers, and online and mobile platforms. Consumer Banking Results Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2014 Net income for Consumer Banking increased $90 million to $1.8 billion primarily driven by higher noninterest income, lower noninterest expense and lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower net interest income. Net interest income decreased $76 million to $5.0 billion as the beneficial impact of an increase in investable assets as a result of higher deposits and higher residential mortgage balances were more than offset by the impact of the allocation of ALM activities, higher funding costs and lower card yields. Noninterest income increased $159 million to $2.8 billion driven by gains on asset sales and higher card income, partially offset by lower service charges. 28 Table of Contents The provision for credit losses decreased $20 million to $648 million driven by continued improvement in credit quality primarily related to our small business and credit card portfolios. Noninterest expense decreased $28 million to $4.4 billion primarily driven by lower personnel and litigation expenses, partially offset by higher fraud costs in advance of Europay, MasterCard and Visa (EMV) chip implementation. The return on average allocated capital was 24 percent , up from 22 percent , reflecting higher net income and a decrease in allocated capital. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 25 . Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014 Net income for Consumer Banking increased $159 million to $4.9 billion primarily driven by lower noninterest expense, higher noninterest income and lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower net interest income. Net interest income decreased $425 million to $14.8 billion primarily due to the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above. Noninterest income increased $202 million to $8.0 billion driven by higher mortgage banking income from improved production margins, and higher card income, partially offset by lower service charges. The provision for credit losses decreased $157 million to $1.9 billion primarily driven by the same factor as described in the three-month discussion above. Noninterest expense decreased $305 million to $13.1 billion primarily driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above. The return on average allocated capital was 23 percent , up from 21 percent , driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above. Deposits Deposits includes the results of consumer deposit activities which consist of a comprehensive range of products provided to consumers and small businesses. Our deposit products include traditional savings accounts, money market savings accounts, CDs and IRAs, noninterest- and interest-bearing checking accounts, as well as investment accounts and products . The revenue is allocated to the deposit products using our funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics. Deposits generates fees such as account service fees, non-sufficient funds fees, overdraft charges and ATM fees, as well as investment and brokerage fees from Merrill Edge accounts. Merrill Edge is an integrated investing and banking service targeted at customers with less than $250,000 in investable assets. Merrill Edge provides investment advice and guidance, client brokerage asset services, a self-directed online investing platform and key banking capabilities including access to the Corporation's network of financial centers and ATMs. Deposits includes the net impact of migrating customers and their related deposit and brokerage asset balances between Deposits and GWIM as well as other client-managed businesses. For more information on the migration of customer balances to or from GWIM , see GWIM on page 33 . Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2014 Net income for Deposits increased $44 million to $695 million driven by higher net interest income and lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower noninterest income. Net interest income increased $51 million to $2.4 billion primarily due to the beneficial impact of an increase in investable assets as a result of higher deposits, partially offset by the impact of the allocation of ALM activities. Noninterest income of $1.2 billion remained relatively unchanged. The provision for credit losses decreased $35 million to $58 million driven by continued improvement in credit quality in the small business portfolio. Noninterest expense of $2.5 billion remained relatively unchanged. Average deposits increased $34.1 billion to $547.7 billion driven by a continuing customer shift to more liquid products in the low rate environment. Growth in checking, traditional savings and money market savings of $45.2 billion was partially offset by a decline in time deposits of $11.0 billion. As a result of our continued pricing discipline and the shift in the mix of deposits, the rate paid on average deposits declined by one bp to five bps . Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014 Net income for Deposits increased $105 million to $2.0 billion driven by lower noninterest expense and provision for credit losses. Net interest income of $7.1 billion remained relatively unchanged as the beneficial impact of an increase in investable assets as a result of higher deposits was offset by the impact of the allocation of ALM activities. Noninterest income of $3.4 billion remained relatively unchanged. 29 Table of Contents The provision for credit losses decreased $62 million to $145 million driven by the same factor as described in the three-month discussion above. Noninterest expense decreased $103 million to $7.3 billion due to lower operating and personnel expenses. Average deposits increased $30.5 billion to $540.8 billion driven by a continuing customer shift to more liquid products in the low rate environment.

Consumer Lending Consumer Lending offers products to consumers and small businesses across the U.S. The products offered include credit and debit cards, residential mortgages and home equity loans, and direct and indirect loans such as automotive, marine, aircraft, recreational vehicle and consumer personal loans. In addition to earning net interest spread revenue on its lending activities, Consumer Lending generates interchange revenue from credit and debit card transactions, late fees, cash advance fees, annual credit card fees, mortgage banking fee income and other miscellaneous fees. Consumer Lending products are available to our customers through our retail network, direct telephone, and online and mobile channels. Consumer Lending includes the net impact of migrating customers and their related loan balances between Consumer Lending and GWIM . For more information on the migration of customer balances to or from GWIM , see GWIM on page 33 . Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2014 Net income for Consumer Lending increased $46 million to $1.1 billion primarily due to higher noninterest income and lower noninterest expense, partially offset by lower net interest income and higher provision for credit losses. Net interest income decreased $127 million to $2.6 billion driven by higher funding costs, lower card yields and lower average card loan balances, and the impact of the allocation of ALM activities, partially offset by higher residential mortgage balances. Noninterest income increased $173 million to $1.6 billion due to gains on asset sales and higher card income. The provision for credit losses increased $15 million to $590 million as continued credit quality improvement in the small business and credit card portfolios was more than offset by increased provision expense within the home loans portfolio. Noninterest expense of $2.0 billion remained relatively unchanged. Average loans increased $9.2 billion to $200.5 billion primarily driven by increases in residential mortgages and consumer vehicle loans, partially offset by lower home equity loans and continued run-off of non-core portfolios. Beginning with new originations in 2014, we retain certain residential mortgages in Consumer Banking , consistent with where the overall relationship is managed; previously such mortgages were in All Other . 30 Table of Contents Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014 Net income for Consumer Lending increased $54 million to $3.0 billion due to higher noninterest income, lower noninterest expense and lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower net interest income. Net interest income decreased $426 million to $7.7 billion driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above. Noninterest income increased $205 million to $4.6 billion due to higher mortgage banking income from improved production margins, and card income. The provision for credit losses decreased $95 million to $1.7 billion driven by continued credit quality improvement within the small business and credit card portfolios. Noninterest expense decreased $202 million to $5.8 billion primarily driven by lower personnel expense. Average loans increased $6.4 billion to $196.7 billion primarily driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above.

During the three months ended September 30, 2015 , the total U.S. credit card risk-adjusted margin increased 21 bps compared to the same period in 2014 due to a gain on an asset sale in the current-year period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015 , the total U.S. credit card risk-adjusted margin decreased 9 bps compared to the same period in 2014 due to a decrease in net interest margin and the net impact of gains on asset sales, partially offset by an improvement in credit quality in the U.S. Card portfolio. Total U.S. credit card purchase volumes increased $2.7 billion to $56.5 billion , and $6.4 billion to $162.6 billion , and debit card purchase volumes increased $1.3 billion to $69.3 billion , and $3.6 billion to $206.9 billion , reflecting higher levels of consumer spending. Mortgage Banking Income Mortgage banking income is earned primarily in Consumer Banking and LAS . Mortgage banking income in Consumer Lending consists mainly of core production income, which is comprised primarily of revenue from the fair value gains and losses recognized on our interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and loans held-for-sale (LHFS), the related secondary market execution, and costs related to representations and warranties in the sales transactions along with other obligations incurred in the sales of mortgage loans. The table below summarizes the components of mortgage banking income.

Core production revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 increased $133 million to $794 million compared to the same period in 2014 primarily due to an increase in margins.

(2) In addition to loan production in Consumer Banking , there is also first mortgage and home equity loan production in GWIM . First mortgage loan originations in Consumer Banking and for the total Corporation increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same periods in 2014 reflecting growth in the overall mortgage market as lower interest rates beginning in late 2014 drove an increase in refinances. During the three months ended September 30, 2015 , 54 percent of the total Corporation first mortgage production volume was for refinance originations and 46 percent was for purchase originations compared to 57 percent and 43 percent for the same period in 2014 . Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP) originations were two percent of all refinance originations compared to five percent for the same period in 2014 . Making Home Affordable non-HARP originations were eight percent of all refinance originations compared to 15 percent for the same period in 2014 . The remaining 90 percent of refinance originations were conventional refinances compared to 80 percent for the same period in 2014 . During the nine months ended September 30, 2015 , 63 percent of the total Corporation first mortgage production volume was for refinance originations and 37 percent was for purchase originations compared to 58 percent and 42 percent for the same period in 2014 . HARP originations were three percent of all refinance originations compared to seven percent for the same period in 2014 . Making Home Affordable non-HARP originations were nine percent of all refinance originations compared to 18 percent for the same period in 2014 . The remaining 88 percent of refinance originations were conventional refinances compared to 75 percent for the same period in 2014 . Home equity production for the total Corporation was $3.1 billion and $9.6 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $3.2 billion and $7.8 billion for the same periods in 2014 , with the nine-month increase due to a higher demand in the market based on improving housing trends, and increased market share driven by improved financial center engagement with customers and more competitive pricing. 32 Table of Contents Global Wealth & Investment Management Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 (Dollars in millions) 2015 2014 % Change 2015 2014 % Change Net interest income (FTE basis) $ 1,376 $ 1,459 (6 )% $ 4,086 $ 4,430 (8 )% Noninterest income: Investment and brokerage services 2,682 2,713 (1 ) 8,154 7,959 2 All other income 410 494 (17 ) 1,318 1,413 (7 ) Total noninterest income 3,092 3,207 (4 ) 9,472 9,372 1 Total revenue, net of interest expense (FTE basis) 4,468 4,666 (4 ) 13,558 13,802 (2 ) Provision for credit losses (2 ) (15 ) (87 ) 36 n/m Noninterest expense 3,447 3,405 1 10,366 10,213 1 Income before income taxes (FTE basis) 1,023 1,276 (20 ) 3,156 3,589 (12 ) Income tax expense (FTE basis) 367 464 (21 ) 1,161 1,325 (12 ) Net income $ 656 $ 812 (19 ) $ 1,995 $ 2,264 (12 ) Net interest yield (FTE basis) 2.12 % 2.33 % 2.14 % 2.38 % Return on average allocated capital 22 27 22 25 Efficiency ratio (FTE basis) 77.14 72.98 76.46 73.99 Balance Sheet Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 Average 2015 2014 % Change 2015 2014 % Change Total loans and leases $ 133,168 $ 121,002 10 % $ 129,881 $ 118,505 10 % Total earning assets 257,344 248,223 4 255,498 249,102 3 Total assets 274,192 266,324 3 272,715 267,779 2 Total deposits 243,980 239,352 2 242,507 240,716 1 Allocated capital 12,000 12,000 12,000 12,000 Period end September 30 2015 December 31 2014 % Change Total loans and leases $ 134,630 $ 125,431 7 % Total earning assets 262,870 256,519 2 Total assets 279,155 274,887 2 Total deposits 246,172 245,391 n/m = not meaningful GWIM consists of two primary businesses: Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management (MLGWM) and U.S. Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management (U.S. Trust). MLGWM's advisory business provides a high-touch client experience through a network of financial advisors focused on clients with over $250,000 in total investable assets . MLGWM provides tailored solutions to meet our clients' needs through a full set of investment management, brokerage, banking and retirement products. U.S. Trust, together with MLGWM's Private Banking & Investments Group, provides comprehensive wealth management solutions targeted to high net worth and ultra high net worth clients, as well as customized solutions to meet clients' wealth structuring, investment management, trust and banking needs, including specialty asset management services. 33 Table of Contents Client assets managed under advisory and/or discretion of GWIM are AUM and are typically held in diversified portfolios. The majority of client AUM have an investment strategy with a duration of greater than one year and are, therefore, considered long-term AUM. Fees earned on long-term AUM are calculated as a percentage of total AUM. The asset management fees charged to clients are dependent on various factors, but are generally driven by the breadth of the client's relationship and generally range from 50 to 150 bps on their total AUM. The net client long-term AUM flows represent the net change in clients' long-term AUM balances over a specified period of time, excluding market appreciation/depreciation and other adjustments. Client assets under advisory and discretion of GWIM in which the investment strategy seeks current income, while maintaining liquidity and capital preservation, are considered liquidity AUM. The duration of these strategies is primarily less than one year. The change in AUM balances from the prior-year periods is primarily the net client flows for liquidity AUM. Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2014 Net income for GWIM decreased $156 million to $656 million driven by declines in both net interest income and noninterest income. Net interest income decreased $83 million to $1.4 billion due to the impact of the allocation of ALM activities, partially offset by the impact of loan and deposit growth. Noninterest income, primarily investment and brokerage services income, decreased $ 115 million to $ 3.1 billion driven by lower transactional revenue, resulting in part from the ongoing migration of clients from brokerage to managed relationships, as well as lower markets and muted new issue activity, partially offset by increased asset management fees due to the impact of long-term AUM flows. Noninterest expense increased $42 million to $3.4 billion primarily due to higher litigation-related costs and continued investment in client-facing professionals. Return on average allocated capital was 22 percent , down from 27 percent , due to a decrease in net income. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 25 . Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014 Net income for GWIM decreased $269 million to $2.0 billion driven by a decrease in revenue and an increase in noninterest expense. Net interest income decreased $344 million to $4.1 billion driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above. Noninterest income, primarily investment and brokerage services income, increased $100 million to $9.5 billion , driven by increased asset management fees due to the impact of long-term AUM flows and higher market levels, partially offset by lower transactional revenue. Noninterest expense increased $153 million to $10.4 billion primarily due to higher revenue-related incentive compensation and investment in client-facing professionals. Return on average allocated capital was 22 percent , down from 25 percent , due to a decrease in net income. 34 Table of Contents Key Indicators and Metrics Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 (Dollars in millions, except as noted) 2015 2014 2015 2014 Revenue by Business Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management $ 3,694 $ 3,874 $ 11,234 $ 11,429 U.S. Trust 756 775 2,271 2,326 Other (1) 18 17 53 47 Total revenue, net of interest expense (FTE basis) $ 4,468 $ 4,666 $ 13,558 $ 13,802 Client Balances by Business, at period end Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management $ 1,942,623 $ 2,004,391 U.S. Trust 375,751 381,054 Other (1) 78,110 76,640 Total client balances $ 2,396,484 $ 2,462,085 Client Balances by Type, at period end Long-term assets under management $ 798,887 $ 811,403 Liquidity assets under management 78,106 76,603 Assets under management 876,993 888,006 Brokerage assets 1,026,355 1,073,858 Assets in custody 109,196 135,886 Deposits 246,172 238,710 Loans and leases (2) 137,768 125,625 Total client balances $ 2,396,484 $ 2,462,085 Assets Under Management Rollforward Assets under management, beginning balance $ 930,360 $ 878,741 $ 902,872 $ 821,449 Net long-term client flows 4,448 11,168 27,695 40,420 Net liquidity client flows (3,210 ) 5,910 1,320 3,616 Market valuation/other (54,605 ) (7,813 ) (54,894 ) 22,521 Total assets under management, ending balance $ 876,993 $ 888,006 $ 876,993 $ 888,006 Associates, at period end (3) Number of financial advisors 16,605 15,867 Total wealth advisors 18,037 17,039 Total client-facing professionals 20,535 19,727 Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management Metrics Financial advisor productivity (4) (in thousands) $ 1,000 $ 1,077 $ 1,027 $ 1,064 U.S. Trust Metrics, at period end Client-facing professionals 2,178 2,135 (1) Includes the results of BofA Global Capital Management, the cash management division of Bank of America, and certain administrative items.

Total revenue excludes the allocation of certain ALM activities. Client balances decreased $65.6 billion , or three percent , to $2.4 trillion driven by lower market levels, partially offset by positive long-term AUM flows. The number of wealth advisors increased six percent , due to continued investment in the advisor development programs, improved competitive recruiting and near historically low advisor attrition levels. 35 Table of Contents Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2014 Revenue from MLGWM of $3.7 billion decreased five percent driven by declines in both net interest income and noninterest income. Net interest income decreased due to the impact of the allocation of ALM activities, partially offset by the impact of loan and deposit growth. Noninterest income decreased driven by lower transactional revenue, partially offset by increased asset management fees due to the impact of long-term AUM flows. Revenue from U.S. Trust of $756 million decreased two percent primarily driven by the impact of the allocation of ALM activities. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014 Revenue from MLGWM of $11.2 billion and U.S. Trust of $2.3 billion were each down two percent due to lower net interest income due to the impact of the allocation of ALM activities, partially offset by higher noninterest income driven by long-term AUM flows and higher market levels.

Revenue decreased $154 million to $4.2 billion primarily due to lower net interest income. The decline in net interest income reflects the impact of the allocation of ALM activities and increased liquidity costs as well as loan spread compression, partially offset by loan growth. Noninterest income decreased $49 million to $1.8 billion primarily driven by higher losses on loans accounted for under the fair value option. The provision for credit losses increased $243 million to $179 million from a provision benefit of $64 million in the prior-year period primarily driven by increases in loan balances combined with reserve releases in the prior-year period. Noninterest expense of $2.0 billion remained relatively unchanged as lower litigation expense was offset by investment in commercial and business bankers. The return on average allocated capital was 14 percent , down from 18 percent , due to increased capital allocations and lower net income. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 25 . Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014 Net income for Global Banking decreased $354 million to $3.9 billion primarily driven by lower revenue and higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower noninterest expense. Revenue decreased $726 million to $12.6 billion primarily due to lower net interest income driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above. Noninterest income decreased $148 million to $5.7 billion primarily driven by lower gains within the leasing business and a gain in the prior period on the sale of an equity investment in Global Commercial Banking. The provision for credit losses increased $99 million to $452 million , driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above. Noninterest expense decreased $248 million to $6.0 billion primarily due to lower litigation expense and technology initiative costs. The return on average allocated capital was 15 percent , down from 17 percent , driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above. 38 Table of Contents Global Corporate, Global Commercial and Business Banking Global Corporate, Global Commercial and Business Banking each include Business Lending and Global Transaction Services activities.

Business Lending revenue declined $267 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 due to the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above as well as a gain in the prior period on the sale of an equity investment in Global Commercial Banking. Global Transaction Services revenue decreased $95 million and $381 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same periods in 2014 primarily due to lower net interest income as a result of the impact of the allocation of ALM activities and liquidity costs. 39 Table of Contents Average loans and leases increased nine percent for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 due to strong origination volumes and increased utilization in the commercial and industrial and commercial real estate portfolios. Average loans and leases increased five percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 due to strong origination volumes and increased utilization in the commercial and industrial portfolio. Average deposits remained relatively unchanged for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same periods in 2014 . Global Investment Banking Client teams and product specialists underwrite and distribute debt, equity and loan products, and provide advisory services and tailored risk management solutions. The economics of most investment banking and underwriting activities are shared primarily between Global Banking and Global Markets based on the activities performed by each segment. To provide a complete discussion of our consolidated investment banking fees, the table below presents total Corporation investment banking fees and the portion attributable to Global Banking.

Total Corporation investment banking fees of $4.3 billion , excluding self-led deals, included within Global Banking and Global Markets, decreased five percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 driven by lower debt and equity issuance fees, partially offset by higher advisory fees. Underwriting fees for debt products declined primarily as a result of lower debt issuance volumes mainly in leveraged finance transactions. 40 Table of Contents Global Markets Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 (Dollars in millions) 2015 2014 % Change 2015 2014 % Change Net interest income (FTE basis) $ 1,135 $ 999 14 % $ 3,172 $ 2,968 7 % Noninterest income: Investment and brokerage services 574 533 8 1,703 1,654 3 Investment banking fees 521 577 (10 ) 1,869 2,073 (10 ) Trading account profits 1,462 1,786 (18 ) 5,282 5,921 (11 ) All other income 379 266 42 935 1,185 (21 ) Total noninterest income 2,936 3,162 (7 ) 9,789 10,833 (10 ) Total revenue, net of interest expense (FTE basis) 4,071 4,161 (2 ) 12,961 13,801 (6 ) Provision for credit losses 42 45 (7 ) 69 83 (17 ) Noninterest expense 2,683 3,357 (20 ) 8,556 9,341 (8 ) Income before income taxes (FTE basis) 1,346 759 77 4,336 4,377 (1 ) Income tax expense (FTE basis) 338 388 (13 ) 1,392 1,597 (13 ) Net income $ 1,008 $ 371 n/m $ 2,944 $ 2,780 6 Return on average allocated capital 11 % 4 % 11 % 11 % Efficiency ratio (FTE basis) 65.91 80.70 66.01 67.68 Balance Sheet Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 Average 2015 2014 % Change 2015 2014 % Change Trading-related assets: Trading account securities $ 196,884 $ 201,964 (3 )% $ 195,842 $ 201,986 (3 )% Reverse repurchases 103,422 116,853 (11 ) 109,415 115,343 (5 ) Securities borrowed 75,786 83,369 (9 ) 78,520 86,455 (9 ) Derivative assets 55,385 44,305 25 55,490 44,103 26 Total trading-related assets (1) 431,477 446,491 (3 ) 439,267 447,887 (2 ) Total loans and leases 66,392 62,959 5 61,798 63,409 (3 ) Total earning assets (1) 439,859 457,836 (4 ) 436,970 464,306 (6 ) Total assets 597,103 599,977 599,472 606,205 (1 ) Total deposits 37,050 39,345 (6 ) 38,813 40,769 (5 ) Allocated capital 35,000 34,000 3 35,000 34,000 3 Period end September 30 2015 December 31 2014 % Change Total trading-related assets (1) $ 407,493 $ 418,860 (3 )% Total loans and leases 70,159 59,388 18 Total earning assets (1) 421,909 421,799 Total assets 579,776 579,594 Total deposits 36,019 40,746 (12 ) (1) Trading-related assets include derivative assets, which are considered non-earning assets. n/m = not meaningful Global Markets offers sales and trading services, including research, to institutional clients across fixed-income, credit, currency, commodity and equity businesses. Global Markets product coverage includes securities and derivative products in both the primary and secondary markets. Global Markets provides market-making, financing, securities clearing, settlement and custody services globally to our institutional investor clients in support of their investing and trading activities. We also work with our commercial and corporate clients to provide risk management products using interest rate, equity, credit, currency and commodity derivatives, foreign exchange, 41 Table of Contents fixed-income and mortgage-related products. As a result of our market-making activities in these products, we may be required to manage risk in a broad range of financial products including government securities, equity and equity-linked securities, high-grade and high-yield corporate debt securities, syndicated loans, mortgage-backed securities (MBS), commodities and asset-backed securities (ABS). The economics of most investment banking and underwriting activities are shared primarily between Global Markets and Global Banking based on the activities performed by each segment . Global Banking originates certain deal-related transactions with our corporate and commercial clients that are executed and distributed by Global Markets. For more information on investment banking fees on a consolidated basis, see page 40 . Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2014 Net income for Global Markets increased $637 million to $1.0 billion . Excluding net DVA, net income increased $571 million to $814 million primarily driven by a decline in noninterest expense and lower tax expense, partially offset by lower revenue. Net DVA gains were $313 million compared to gains of $205 million . Sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, decreased $124 million primarily driven by lower FICC revenue, partially offset by increased Equities revenue. Noninterest expense decreased $674 million to $2.7 billion largely due to lower litigation expense and to a lesser extent lower revenue-related incentive compensation and support costs. The effective tax rate for the year-ago quarter reflected the impact of non-deductible litigation expense. Average earning assets decreased $18.0 billion to $439.9 billion largely driven by a decrease in reverse repos, securities borrowed and trading securities primarily due to reduction in client financing activity and continuing balance sheet optimization efforts across Global Markets . The return on average allocated capital was 11 percent , up from four percent , primarily driven by higher net income. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 25 . Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014 Net income for Global Markets increased $164 million to $2.9 billion . Excluding net DVA, net income increased $136 million to $2.7 billion primarily driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above, partially offset by lower equity investment gains (not included in sales and trading revenue) as the year-ago period included gains related to the IPO of an equity investment. Net DVA gains were $434 million compared to gains of $386 million . Sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, decreased $415 million primarily driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above. Noninterest expense decreased $785 million to $8.6 billion driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above. Average earning assets decreased $27.3 billion to $437.0 billion primarily driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above. Period-end loans and leases increased $10.8 billion from December 31, 2014 due to growth in mortgage and securitization finance. The return on average allocated capital was unchanged at 11 percent , reflecting increases in both net income and allocated capital. 42 Table of Contents Sales and Trading Revenue Sales and trading revenue includes unrealized and realized gains and losses on trading and other assets, net interest income, and fees primarily from commissions on equity securities. Sales and trading revenue is segregated into fixed-income (government debt obligations, investment and non-investment grade corporate debt obligations, commercial mortgage-backed securities, residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), interest rate and credit derivative contracts), currencies (interest rate and foreign exchange contracts), commodities (primarily futures, forwards, swaps and options) and equities (equity-linked derivatives and cash equity activity). The table below and related discussion present sales and trading revenue, substantially all of which is in Global Markets, with the remainder in Global Banking . In addition, the table below and related discussion present sales and trading revenue excluding the impact of net DVA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe the use of this non-GAAP financial measure provides clarity in assessing the underlying performance of these businesses. Sales and Trading Revenue (1, 2) Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 (Dollars in millions) 2015 2014 2015 2014 Sales and trading revenue Fixed-income, currencies and commodities $ 2,285 $ 2,387 $ 7,277 $ 7,856 Equities 1,191 1,105 3,555 3,343 Total sales and trading revenue $ 3,476 $ 3,492 $ 10,832 $ 11,199 Sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA (3) Fixed-income, currencies and commodities $ 2,007 $ 2,254 $ 6,912 $ 7,587 Equities 1,156 1,033 3,486 3,226 Total sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA (3) $ 3,163 $ 3,287 $ 10,398 $ 10,813 (1) Includes FTE adjustments of $43 million and $140 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $39 million and $131 million for the same periods in 2014 . For more information on sales and trading revenue, see Note 2 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . (2) Includes Global Banking sales and trading revenue of $86 million and $295 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $67 million and $221 million for the same periods in 2014 . (3) FICC and Equities sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, is a non-GAAP financial measure. FICC net DVA gains were $278 million and $365 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to net DVA gains of $133 million and $269 million for the same periods in 2014 . Equities net DVA gains were $35 million and $69 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to net DVA gains of $72 million and $117 million for the same periods in 2014 . Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2014 FICC revenue, excluding net DVA, decreased $247 million to $2.0 billion primarily driven by declines in credit-related businesses due to lower client activity, partially offset by stronger results in rates products. Equities revenue, excluding net DVA, increased $123 million to $1.2 billion primarily driven by strong performance in derivatives, reflecting favorable market conditions. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014 FICC revenue, excluding net DVA, decreased $675 million to $6.9 billion and Equities revenue, excluding net DVA, increased $260 million to $3.5 billion . Both were driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above as well as stronger results in currencies and commodities products within FICC and a benefit in Equities from increased client activity in the Asia-Pacific region. 43 Table of Contents Legacy Assets & Servicing Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 (Dollars in millions) 2015 2014 % Change 2015 2014 % Change Net interest income (FTE basis) $ 383 $ 387 (1 )% $ 1,228 $ 1,126 9 % Noninterest income: Mortgage banking income 266 152 75 1,409 812 74 All other income 192 17 n/m 207 104 99 Total noninterest income 458 169 n/m 1,616 916 76 Total revenue, net of interest expense (FTE basis) 841 556 51 2,844 2,042 39 Provision for credit losses 6 267 (98 ) 154 240 (36 ) Noninterest expense 1,143 6,648 (83 ) 3,307 19,287 (83 ) Loss before income taxes (FTE basis) (308 ) (6,359 ) (95 ) (617 ) (17,485 ) (96 ) Income tax benefit (FTE basis) (112 ) (1,245 ) (91 ) (227 ) (4,748 ) (95 ) Net loss $ (196 ) $ (5,114 ) (96 ) $ (390 ) $ (12,737 ) (97 ) Net interest yield (FTE basis) 3.69 % 3.77 % 3.94 % 3.90 % Balance Sheet Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 Average 2015 2014 % Change 2015 2014 % Change Total loans and leases $ 29,074 $ 35,238 (17 )% $ 30,782 $ 36,672 (16 )% Total earning assets 41,179 40,718 1 41,678 38,625 8 Total assets 50,719 53,843 (6 ) 51,994 54,030 (4 ) Allocated capital 24,000 17,000 41 24,000 17,000 41 Period end September 30 2015 December 31 2014 % Change Total loans and leases $ 27,982 $ 33,055 (15 )% Total earning assets 40,187 33,923 18 Total assets 49,080 45,958 7 n/m = not meaningful LAS is responsible for our mortgage servicing activities related to residential first mortgage and home equity loans serviced for others and loans held by the Corporation, including loans that have been designated as the LAS Portfolios. The LAS Portfolios (both owned and serviced), herein referred to as the Legacy Owned and Legacy Serviced Portfolios, respectively (together, the Legacy Portfolios), and as further defined below, include those loans originated prior to January 1, 2011 that would not have been originated under our established underwriting standards as of December 31, 2010. For more information on our Legacy Portfolios , see page 45 . In addition, LAS is responsible for managing certain legacy exposures related to mortgage origination, sales and servicing activities (e.g., litigation, representations and warranties). LAS also includes the financial results of the home equity portfolio selected as part of the Legacy Owned Portfolio and the results of MSR activities, including net hedge results . LAS includes certain revenues and expenses on loans serviced for others, including owned loans serviced for Consumer Banking , GWIM and All Other . 44 Table of Contents Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2014 The net loss for LAS decreased $4.9 billion to $196 million primarily driven by significantly lower litigation expense, which is included in noninterest expense. Also contributing to the decrease in the net loss were higher revenue, lower provision for credit losses and lower noninterest expense, excluding litigation. Revenue increased $285 million primarily due to gains realized from the deconsolidation of certain home equity securitizations as well as higher mortgage banking income. Mortgage banking income increased due to improved MSR net-of-hedge performance and lower representations and warranties provision, partially offset by lower mortgage servicing fees. The provision for credit losses decreased $261 million primarily driven by costs related to the consumer relief portion of the DoJ settlement in the prior-year period. Noninterest expense decreased $5.5 billion primarily due to a $5.1 billion decrease in litigation expense. Excluding litigation, noninterest expense decreased $430 million to $915 million due to lower default-related staffing and other default-related servicing expenses. We believe we are on track to achieve our goal of reducing noninterest expense, excluding litigation expense, to approximately $800 million, per quarter beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase in allocated capital for LAS reflects higher Basel 3 Advanced approaches operational risk capital than in 2014. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 25 . Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014 The net loss for LAS decreased $12.3 billion to $390 million primarily driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above. Total revenue increased $802 million due to higher mortgage banking income reflecting a decrease in representation and warranties provision and higher MSR net-of-hedge performance, partially offset by lower servicing fees due to a smaller portfolio. The provision for credit losses decreased $86 million primarily driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above. Noninterest expense decreased $16.0 billion primarily due to a $14.5 billion decrease in litigation expense. Excluding litigation, noninterest expense decreased $1.5 billion to $2.8 billion due to lower default-related staffing and other default-related servicing expenses. The increase in allocated capital for LAS was driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above. Servicing LAS is responsible for all of our in-house servicing activities related to the residential mortgage and home equity loan portfolios, including owned loans and loans serviced for others (collectively, the mortgage serviced portfolio). A portion of this portfolio has been designated as the Legacy Serviced Portfolio, which represented 26 percent and 27 percent of the total mortgage serviced portfolio, as measured by unpaid principal balance, at September 30, 2015 and 2014 . In addition, LAS is responsible for managing vendors who subservice on our behalf. Servicing activities include collecting cash for principal, interest and escrow payments from borrowers, disbursing customer draws for lines of credit, accounting for and remitting principal and interest payments to investors and escrow payments to third parties, and responding to customer inquiries. Our home retention efforts, including single point of contact resources, are also part of our servicing activities, along with supervision of foreclosures and property dispositions. Prior to foreclosure, LAS evaluates various workout options in an effort to help our customers avoid foreclosure. For more information on our servicing activities, including the impact of foreclosure delays, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Servicing, Foreclosure and Other Mortgage Matters on page 53 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Legacy Portfolios The Legacy Portfolios (both owned and serviced) include those loans originated prior to January 1, 2011 that would not have been originated under our established underwriting standards in place as of December 31, 2010. The purchased credit-impaired (PCI) portfolio, as well as certain loans that met a pre-defined delinquency status or probability of default threshold as of January 1, 2011, are also included in the Legacy Portfolios. Since determining the pool of loans to be included in the Legacy Portfolios as of January 1, 2011, the criteria have not changed for these portfolios, but will continue to be evaluated over time. Legacy Owned Portfolio The Legacy Owned Portfolio includes those loans that met the criteria as described above and are on the balance sheet of the Corporation. Home equity loans in this portfolio are held on the balance sheet of LAS, and residential mortgage loans in this portfolio are included as part of All Other . The financial results of the on-balance sheet loans are reported in the segment that owns the loans or in All Other . Total loans in the Legacy Owned Portfolio decreased $14.2 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $75.7 billion , of which $28.0 billion was held on the LAS balance sheet and the remainder was included in All Other . The decrease was largely due to payoffs and paydowns, as well as loan sales. 45 Table of Contents Legacy Serviced Portfolio The Legacy Serviced Portfolio includes loans serviced by LAS in both the Legacy Owned Portfolio and those loans serviced for outside investors that met the criteria as described above. The table below summarizes the balances of the residential mortgage loans included in the Legacy Serviced Portfolio (the Legacy Residential Mortgage Serviced Portfolio) representing 24 percent and 25 percent of the total residential mortgage serviced portfolio of $504 billion and $636 billion , as measured by unpaid principal balance, at September 30, 2015 and 2014 . The decline in the Legacy Residential Mortgage Serviced Portfolio was due to paydowns and payoffs, and MSR and loan sales.

Non-Legacy Portfolio As previously discussed, LAS is responsible for all of our servicing activities. The table below summarizes the balances of the residential mortgage loans that are not included in the Legacy Serviced Portfolio (the Non-Legacy Residential Mortgage Serviced Portfolio) representing 76 percent and 75 percent of the total residential mortgage serviced portfolio, as measured by unpaid principal balance, at September 30, 2015 and 2014 . The decline in the Non-Legacy Residential Mortgage Serviced Portfolio was primarily due to paydowns and payoffs, partially offset by new originations. Non-Legacy Residential Mortgage Serviced Portfolio, a subset of the Residential Mortgage Serviced Portfolio (1) September 30 (Dollars in billions) 2015 2014 Unpaid principal balance Residential mortgage loans Total $ 383 $ 476 60 days or more past due 6 10 Number of loans serviced (in thousands) Residential mortgage loans Total 2,438 3,035 60 days or more past due 33 58 (1) Excludes $47 billion and $50 billion of home equity loans and HELOCs at September 30, 2015 and 2014 . LAS Mortgage Banking Income LAS mortgage banking income includes income earned in connection with servicing activities and MSR valuation adjustments, net of results from risk management activities used to hedge certain market risks of the MSRs. The costs associated with our servicing activities are included in noninterest expense. LAS mortgage banking income also includes the cost of legacy representations and warranties exposures and revenue from the sales of loans that had returned to performing status. The table below summarizes LAS mortgage banking income. 46 Table of Contents LAS Mortgage Banking Income Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 (Dollars in millions) 2015 2014 2015 2014 Servicing income: Servicing fees $ 345 $ 471 $ 1,167 $ 1,496 Amortization of expected cash flows (1) (179 ) (201 ) (564 ) (620 ) Fair value changes of MSRs, net of risk management activities used to hedge certain market risks (2) 83 (19 ) 526 152 Other servicing-related revenue 8 Total net servicing income 249 251 1,129 1,036 Representations and warranties (provision) benefit (77 ) (152 ) 37 (447 ) Other mortgage banking income (3) 94 53 243 223 Total LAS mortgage banking income $ 266 $ 152 $ 1,409 $ 812 (1) Represents the net change in fair value of the MSR asset due to the recognition of modeled cash flows. (2) Includes gains (losses) on sales of MSRs. (3) Consists primarily of revenue from sales of repurchased loans that had returned to performing status. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 , LAS mortgage banking income increased $114 million to $266 million , and $597 million to $1.4 billion compared to the same periods in 2014 , primarily driven by a benefit in the provision for representations and warranties in the nine-month period, and improved MSR net-of-hedge performance, partially offset by lower servicing fees due to a smaller servicing portfolio. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 , servicing fees declined 27 percent and 22 percent to $345 million and $1.2 billion as the size of the servicing portfolio continued to decline driven by loan prepayment activity, which exceeded new originations primarily due to our exit from non-retail channels, as well as strategic sales of MSRs in prior periods. The $37 million benefit in the provision for representations and warranties for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to a provision of $447 million in the same period in 2014 was primarily driven by the impact of the ACE Securities Corp. v. DB Structured Products, Inc. (ACE) decision, as time-barred claims are now treated as resolved.

Such allocated assets were $494.3 billion and $496.3 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $490.6 billion and $480.1 billion for the same periods in 2014 , and $493.7 billion and $474.6 billion at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . n/m = not meaningful 48 Table of Contents All Other consists of ALM activities, equity investments, the international consumer card business, liquidating businesses, residual expense allocations and other. ALM activities encompass residential mortgages, debt securities, interest rate and foreign currency risk management activities including the residual net interest income allocation, the impact of certain allocation methodologies and accounting hedge ineffectiveness. The results of certain ALM activities are allocated to our business segments . Beginning with new originations in 2014, we retain certain residential mortgages in Consumer Banking , consistent with where the overall relationship is managed; previously such mortgages were in All Other . Additionally, certain residential mortgage loans that are managed by LAS are held in All Other . For more information on our ALM activities, see Interest Rate Risk Management for Non-trading Activities on page 118 and Note 18 Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Equity investments include our merchant services joint venture as well as Global Principal Investments (GPI) which is comprised of a portfolio of equity, real estate and other alternative investments. For more information on our merchant services joint venture, see Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2014 Net income for All Other decreased $505 million to $4 million due to lower net interest income and a decrease in the benefit in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by gains on the sales of consumer real estate loans. Net interest income decreased $570 million compared to the same period in 2014 primarily driven by the negative impact of the market-related adjustments on debt securities due to lower long-term interest rates. Gains on the sales of loans, including nonperforming and other delinquent loans, net of hedges, were $370 million compared to gains of $223 million, and are included in all other loss in the table on page 48 . Also included in all other loss were U.K. PPI costs of $303 million compared to $298 million, and negative FTE adjustments of $342 million compared to $301 million to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking . The benefit in the provision for credit losses decreased $198 million to a benefit of $67 million compared to the prior-year period primarily due to a slower pace of reserve releases in the current period. Noninterest expense decreased $174 million to $80 million reflecting a decrease in litigation expense and lower personnel and infrastructure costs, partially offset by higher professional fees related in part to our CCAR resubmission. The income tax benefit was $507 million compared to a benefit of $541 million , as the prior-period tax benefits attributable to the resolution of several tax examinations exceeded the current period tax benefits related to certain non-U.S. restructurings. In addition, both periods include income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking . Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014 Net income for All Other decreased $645 million to a net loss of $199 million due to a decrease in equity investment income, lower gains on sales of debt securities and a decrease in the benefit in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher net interest income, gains on sales of consumer real estate loans, lower U.K. PPI costs and a decrease in noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $213 million primarily driven by the impact of market-related adjustments on debt securities. Negative market-related adjustments on debt securities were $412 million compared to $503 million in the prior-year period. Equity investment income decreased $800 million as the prior-year period included a gain on the sale of a portion of an equity investment. Gains on the sales of loans, including nonperforming and other delinquent loans, net of hedges, were $934 million compared to gains of $405 million in the prior-year period. Also included in all other loss were U.K. PPI costs of $319 million compared to $482 million, and negative FTE adjust ments of $1.2 billion compared to $962 million to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking. The benefit in the provision for credit losses declined $417 million to a benefit of $230 million primarily driven by the same factor as described in the three-month discussion above as well as lower recoveries on nonperforming loan sales. Noninterest expense decreased $436 million to $2.0 billion primarily driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above. The income tax benefit was $1.6 billion compared to a benefit of $2.1 billion , as the prior-year period included tax benefits attributable to the resolution of several tax examinations. In addition, both periods include income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking . 49 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have contractual obligations to make future payments on debt and lease agreements. Additionally, in the normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements whereby we commit to future purchases of products or services from unaffiliated parties. For more information on obligations and commitments, see Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements , Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations on page 50 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K , as well as Note 11 Long-term Debt and Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Representations and Warranties We securitize first-lien residential mortgage loans generally in the form of RMBS guaranteed by the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), which include FHLMC and FNMA, or by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) in the case of Federal Housing Administration (FHA)-insured, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)-guaranteed and Rural Housing Service-guaranteed mortgage loans, and sell pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans in the form of whole loans. In addition, in prior years, legacy companies and certain subsidiaries sold pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans and home equity loans as private-label securitizations (in certain of these securitizations, monoline insurers or other financial guarantee providers insured all or some of the securities) or in the form of whole loans. In connection with these transactions, we or certain of our subsidiaries or legacy companies made various representations and warranties. Breaches of these representations and warranties have resulted in and may continue to result in the requirement to repurchase mortgage loans or to otherwise make whole or provide other remedies to the GSEs, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development with respect to FHA-insured loans, VA, whole-loan investors, securitization trusts, monoline insurers or other financial guarantors as applicable (collectively, repurchases). In all such cases, subsequent to repurchasing the loan, we would be exposed to any credit loss on the repurchased mortgage loans after accounting for any mortgage insurance (MI) or mortgage guarantee payments that we may receive. We have vigorously contested any request for repurchase where we have concluded that a valid basis for repurchase does not exist and will continue to do so in the future. However, in an effort to resolve legacy mortgage-related issues, we have reached settlements, certain of which have been for significant amounts, in lieu of a loan-by-loan review process, including with the GSEs, four monoline insurers and BNY Mellon, as trustee for certain securitization trusts. For more information on accounting for representations and warranties, repurchase claims and exposures, including a summary of the larger bulk settlements, see Note 7 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees and Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Settlement with the Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee On April 22, 2015, the New York County Supreme Court entered final judgment approving the BNY Mellon Settlement. In October 2015, BNY Mellon obtained certain state tax opinions and an IRS private letter ruling confirming that the settlement will not impact the real estate mortgage investment conduit tax status of the trusts. The final conditions of the settlement have thus been satisfied, requiring the Corporation to make the settlement payment of $8.5 billion (excluding legal fees) on or before February 9, 2016. The settlement payment and legal fees were previously fully reserved. BNY Mellon is required to determine the share of the settlement payment that will be allocated to each of the trusts covered by the settlement and then to distribute those amounts. For information on servicing matters associated with the BNY Mellon Settlement, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Mortgage-related Settlements Servicing Matters on page 54 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K . New York Court Decision on Statute of Limitations On June 11, 2015, the New York Court of Appeals, New York's highest appellate court, issued its opinion on the statute of limitations applicable to representations and warranties claims in ACE Securities Corp. v. DB Structured Products, Inc. (ACE). The Court of Appeals held that, under New York law, a claim for breach of contractual representations and warranties begins to run at the time the representations and warranties are made, and rejected the argument that the six-year statute of limitations does not begin to run until the time repurchase is refused. The Court of Appeals also held that compliance with the contractual notice and cure period was a pre-condition to filing suit, and claims that did not comply with such contractual requirements prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations period were invalid. While no entity affiliated with the Corporation was a party to this litigation, the vast majority of the private-label RMBS trusts into which entities affiliated with the Corporation sold loans and made representations and warranties are governed by New York law. While the Corporation treats claims where the statute of limitations has expired, as determined in accordance with the ACE decision, as time-barred and therefore resolved and no longer outstanding, investors or trustees may seek to distinguish certain aspects of the ACE decision or to 50 Table of Contents assert other claims seeking to avoid the impact of the ACE decision. For example, a recent ruling by a New York intermediate appellate court allowed a counterparty to pursue litigation on loans in the entire trust even though only some of the loans complied with the condition precedent of timely pre-suit notice and opportunity to cure or repurchase. The potential impact on the Corporation, if any, of judicial limitations on the ACE decision, or claims seeking to distinguish or avoid the ACE decision is unclear at this time. For additional information, see Note 7 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2015. Unresolved Repurchase Claims Unresolved representations and warranties repurchase claims represent the notional amount of repurchase claims made by counterparties, typically the outstanding principal balance or the unpaid principal balance at the time of default . In the case of first-lien mortgages, the claim amount is often significantly greater than the expected loss amount due to the benefit of collateral and, in some cases, MI or mortgage guarantee payments . Claims received from a counterparty remain outstanding until the underlying loan is repurchased, the claim is rescinded by the counterparty, we determine that the applicable statute of limitations has expired, or representations and warranties claims with respect to the applicable trust are settled, and fully and finally released . When a claim is denied and we do not receive a response from the counterparty, the claim remains in the unresolved repurchase claims balance until resolution in one of the ways described above . At September 30, 2015 , we had $18.3 billion of unresolved repurchase claims, net of duplicate claims, compared to $22.8 billion at December 31, 2014 . These repurchase claims primarily relate to private-label securitizations and exclude claims in the amount of $7.4 billion at September 30, 2015 , net of duplicate claims, where the statute of limitations has expired without litigation being commenced . At December 31, 2014 , time-barred claims of $5.2 billion , net of duplicate claims, were included in unresolved repurchase claims . The notional amount of unresolved repurchase claims at both September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 includes $3.5 billion of claims, net of duplicate claims, related to loans in specific private-label securitization groups or tranches where we own substantially all of the outstanding securities. For additional information, see Note 7 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements . The decrease in the notional amount of outstanding unresolved repurchase claims, net of duplicate claims, in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily due to the impact of the ACE decision. Excluding time-barred claims that were treated as outstanding at December 31, 2014, the remaining outstanding unresolved repurchase claims are driven by: (1) continued submission of claims by private-label securitization trustees, (2) the level of detail, support and analysis accompanying such claims, which impact overall claim quality and, therefore, claims resolution and (3) the lack of an established process to resolve disputes related to these claims . For example, claims submitted without individual file reviews generally lack the level of detail and analysis of individual loans that is necessary to evaluate a claim . During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 , we had limited loan-level representations and warranties repurchase claims experience with the monoline insurers due to bulk settlements in prior years and ongoing litigation with a single monoline insurer. For additional information, see Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K . As a result of various bulk settlements with the GSEs , we have resolved substantially all outstanding and potential representations and warranties repurchase claims on whole loans sold by legacy Bank of America and Countrywide Financial Corporation (Countrywide) to FNMA and FHLMC through June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2009, respectively. After these settlements , our exposure to representations and warranties liability for loans originated prior to 2009 and sold to the GSEs is limited to loans with an original principal balance of $18.3 billion and loans with certain characteristics excluded from the settlements that we do not believe will be material, such as certain specified violations of the GSEs' charters, fraud and title defects. As of September 30, 2015 , of the $18.3 billion , approximately $16.0 billion in principal has been paid and $991 million in principal has defaulted or was severely delinquent . At September 30, 2015 , the notional amount of unresolved repurchase claims submitted by the GSEs was $20 million related to these vintages . For more information on the monolines and experience with the GSEs, see Note 7 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements . In addition to unresolved repurchase claims , we have received notifications from sponsors of third-party securitizations with whom we engaged in whole-loan transactions indicating that we may have indemnity obligations with respect to loans for which we have not received a repurchase request . These outstanding notifications totaled $1.4 billion and $2.0 billion at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . We also from time to time receive correspondence purporting to raise representations and warranties breach issues from entities that do not have contractual standing or ability to bring such claims . We believe such communications to be procedurally and/or substantively invalid, and generally do not respond . 51 Table of Contents The presence of repurchase claims on a given trust, receipt of notices of indemnification obligations and receipt of other communications, as discussed above, are all factors that inform our liability for representations and warranties and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss . Representations and Warranties Liability The liability for representations and warranties and corporate guarantees is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the related provision is included in mortgage banking income in the Consolidated Statement of Income . For more information on the representations and warranties liability and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Estimated Range of Possible Loss on page 54 and Note 7 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements . At September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 , the liability for representations and warranties was $11.5 billion and $12.1 billion , which includes $8.6 billion related to the BNY Mellon Settlement. The representations and warranties provision was $75 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to a provision of $167 million for the same period in 2014 . The representations and warranties benefit was $46 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to a provision of $433 million for the same period in 2014 . The benefit in the provision for representations and warranties for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to a provision in the same period in 2014 was primarily driven by the impact of the ACE decision, as time-barred claims are now treated as resolved . Our liability for representations and warranties is necessarily dependent on, and limited by, a number of factors including for private-label securitizations the implied repurchase experience based on the BNY Mellon Settlement, as well as certain other assumptions and judgmental factors. Where relevant, we also consider more recent experience, such as claim activity, notification of potential indemnification obligations, our experience with various counterparties, the ACE decision and other recent court decisions related to the statute of limitations and other facts and circumstances, such as bulk settlements, as we believe appropriate. Accordingly, future provisions associated with obligations under representations and warranties may be materially impacted if future experiences are different from historical experience or our understandings, interpretations or assumptions. Experience with Private-label Securitization and Whole-loan Investors In prior years, legacy companies and certain subsidiaries sold pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans and home equity loans as private-label securitizations or in the form of whole loans to investors other than the GSEs (although the GSEs are investors in certain private-label securitizations). The majority of the loans sold were included in private-label securitizations, including third-party sponsored transactions. We provided representations and warranties to the whole-loan investors and these investors may retain those rights even when the whole loans were aggregated with other collateral into private-label securitizations sponsored by the whole-loan investors. Such loans originated from 2004 through 2008 had an original principal balance of $970 billion , including $786 billion sold to private-label and whole-loan investors without monoline insurance. Of the $970 billion , $582 billion in principal has been paid, $212 billion in principal has defaulted, $36 billion in principal was severely delinquent, and $140 billion in principal was current or less than 180 days past due at September 30, 2015 , as summarized in Table 18 . Loans originated between 2004 and 2008 and sold without monoline insurance had an original total principal balance of $786 billion , which is included in Table 18 . Of the $786 billion , $477 billion has been paid in full and $196 billion was defaulted or severely delinquent at September 30, 2015 . At least 25 payments have been made on approximately 64 percent of the defaulted and severely delinquent loans. 52 Table of Contents Table 18 Overview of Non-Agency Securitization and Whole-Loan Balances from 2004 to 2008 Principal Balance Defaulted or Severely Delinquent (Dollars in billions) Original Principal Balance Outstanding Principal Balance September 30 2015 Outstanding Principal Balance 180 Days or More Past Due Defaulted Principal Balance Defaulted or Severely Delinquent Borrower Made Less than 13 Payments Borrower Made 13 to 24 Payments Borrower Made 25 to 36 Payments Borrower Made More than 36 Payments By Entity Bank of America $ 100 $ 13 $ 2 $ 8 $ 10 $ 1 $ 2 $ 2 $ 5 Countrywide BNY Mellon Settlement 409 89 19 88 107 15 26 25 41 Other 307 50 11 67 78 9 18 18 33 Total Countrywide 716 139 30 155 185 24 44 43 74 Merrill Lynch 72 12 2 20 22 4 5 4 9 First Franklin 82 12 2 29 31 5 7 5 14 Total (1, 2) $ 970 $ 176 $ 36 $ 212 $ 248 $ 34 $ 58 $ 54 $ 102 By Product Prime $ 302 $ 48 $ 5 $ 29 $ 34 $ 2 $ 6 $ 7 $ 19 Alt-A 173 40 8 42 50 7 12 11 20 Pay option 150 30 8 46 54 5 13 15 21 Subprime 251 46 13 75 88 17 21 16 34 Home equity 88 9 18 18 2 5 4 7 Other 6 3 2 2 4 1 1 1 1 Total $ 970 $ 176 $ 36 $ 212 $ 248 $ 34 $ 58 $ 54 $ 102 (1) Excludes transactions sponsored by Bank of America and Merrill Lynch where no representations or warranties were made. (2) Includes exposures on third-party sponsored transactions related to legacy entity originations. As it relates to private-label securitizations, a contractual liability to repurchase mortgage loans generally arises if there is a breach of representations and warranties that materially and adversely affects the interest of the investor or all the investors in a securitization trust or of the monoline insurer or other financial guarantor (as applicable). We have received approximately $36.8 billion of representations and warranties repurchase claims (including duplicate claims) related to loans originated between 2004 and 2008 , including $27.5 billion from private-label securitization trustees and a financial guarantee provider, $8.5 billion from whole-loan investors and $816 million from one private-label securitization counterparty. New private-label claims are primarily related to repurchase requests received from trustees for private-label securitization transactions not included in the BNY Mellon Settlement . Of the $36.8 billion in claims, we have resolved $17.5 billion of these claims with losses of $2.0 billion . Approximately $3.8 billion of these claims were resolved through repurchase or indemnification, $5.0 billion were rescinded by the investor, $336 million were resolved through settlements and $8.4 billion are not actionable under the applicable statute of limitations and are therefore considered resolved. At September 30, 2015 , for these vintages, the notional amount of unresolved repurchase claims (including duplicate claims) submitted by private-label securitization trustees, whole-loan investors, including third-party securitization sponsors and others was $19.2 billion , before subtracting $2.6 billion of duplicate claims primarily submitted without loan file reviews, resulting in net unresolved repurchase claims of $16.6 billion . We have performed an initial review with respect to substantially all of these claims and although we do not believe a valid basis for repurchase has been established by the claimant, we consider such claims activity in the computation of our liability for representations and warranties. Until we receive a repurchase claim, we generally do not review loan files related to private-label securitizations and believe we are not required by the governing documents to do so, unless particular facts suggest we should review an individual loan file. 53 Table of Contents Estimated Range of Possible Loss We currently estimate that the range of possible loss for representations and warranties exposures could be up to $2 billion over existing accruals at September 30, 2015 . We treat claims that are time-barred as resolved and do not consider such claims in the estimated range of possible loss . The estimated range of possible loss reflects principally non-GSE exposures. It represents a reasonably possible loss, but does not represent a probable loss, and is based on currently available information, significant judgment and a number of assumptions that are subject to change. For more information on the methodology used to estimate the representations and warranties liability, the corresponding estimated range of possible loss and the types of losses not considered, see Note 7 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K and, for more information related to the sensitivity of the assumptions used to estimate our liability for representations and warranties, see Complex Accounting Estimates Representations and Warranties Liability on page 113 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Servicing, Foreclosure and Other Mortgage Matters We service a large portion of the loans we or our subsidiaries have securitized and also service loans on behalf of third-party securitization vehicles and other investors. Our servicing obligations are set forth in servicing agreements with the applicable counterparty. These obligations may include, but are not limited to, loan repurchase requirements in certain circumstances, indemnifications, payment of fees, advances for foreclosure costs that are not reimbursable, or responsibility for losses in excess of partial guarantees for VA loans. Servicing agreements with the GSEs and GNMA generally provide the GSEs and GNMA with broader rights relative to the servicer than are found in servicing agreements with private investors. For example, the GSEs claim that they have the contractual right to loan repurchase for certain servicing breaches. In addition, the GSEs' first-lien mortgage seller/servicer guides provide timelines to resolve delinquent loans through workout efforts or liquidation, if necessary, and require the imposition of compensatory fees if those deadlines are not satisfied except for reasons beyond the control of the servicer. Servicers for GNMA are required to service in accordance with the applicable government agency requirements which include detailed regulatory requirements for servicing loans and reducing the amount of insurance or guaranty benefits that are paid if the applicable timelines are not satisfied. In addition, many non-agency RMBS and whole-loan servicing agreements state that the servicer may be liable for failure to perform its servicing obligations in keeping with industry standards or for acts or omissions that involve willful malfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of, or reckless disregard of, the servicer's duties. It is not possible to reasonably estimate our liability with respect to certain potential servicing-related claims. While we have recorded certain accruals for servicing-related claims, the amount of potential liability in excess of existing accruals could be material to the Corporation's results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period.

Managing Risk Risk is inherent in all our business activities. The seven types of risk faced by the Corporation are strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. Sound risk management is needed to serve our customers and deliver for our shareholders. If not managed well, risks can result in financial loss, regulatory sanctions and penalties, and damage to our reputation, each of which may adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategies. The Corporation takes a comprehensive approach to risk management with a defined Risk Framework and an articulated Risk Appetite Statement which are approved annually by the Corporation's Board of Directors (the Board) and the Board's Enterprise Risk Committee (ERC). Our Risk Framework is the foundation for comprehensive management of the risks facing the Corporation. The Risk Framework sets forth clear roles, responsibilities and accountability for the management of risk and provides a blueprint for how the Board, through delegation of authority to committees and executive officers, establishes risk appetite and associated limits for our activities. Our Risk Appetite Statement is intended to ensure that the Corporation maintains an acceptable risk profile by providing a common framework and a comparable set of measures for senior management and the Board to clearly indicate the level of risk the Corporation is willing to accept. Risk appetite is set at least annually in conjunction with the strategic, capital and financial operating plans to align risk appetite with the Corporation's strategy and financial resources. Our line of business strategies and risk appetite are also similarly aligned. For a more detailed discussion of our risk management activities, see the discussion below and pages 55 through 109 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 55 Table of Contents Strategic Risk Management Strategic risk is embedded in every business and is one of the major risk categories along with credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. It is the risk that results from incorrect assumptions, inappropriate business plans, ineffective business strategy execution, or failure to respond in a timely manner to changes in the regulatory, macroeconomic and competitive environments, customer preferences, and technology developments in the geographic locations in which we operate. Our appetite for strategic risk is assessed based on the strategic plan, with strategic risks selectively and carefully considered against the backdrop of the evolving marketplace. Strategic risk is managed in the context of our overall financial condition, risk appetite and stress test results, among other considerations. The chief executive officer and executive management team manage and act on significant strategic actions, such as divestitures, consolidation of legal entities or capital actions subsequent to required review and approval by the Board. For more information on our strategic risk management activities, see page 58 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Capital Management The Corporation manages its capital position to maintain sufficient capital to support its business activities and to maintain capital, risk and risk appetite commensurate with one another. Additionally, we seek to maintain safety and soundness at all times, even under adverse scenarios, take advantage of organic growth opportunities, maintain ready access to financial markets, continue to serve as a credit intermediary, remain a source of strength for our subsidiaries, and satisfy current and future regulatory capital requirements. Capital management is integrated into our risk and governance processes, as capital is a key consideration in the development of our strategic plan, risk appetite and risk limits. We conduct an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) on a periodic basis. The ICAAP is a forward-looking assessment of our projected capital needs and resources, incorporating earnings, balance sheet and risk forecasts under baseline and adverse economic and market conditions. We utilize periodic stress tests to assess the potential impacts to our balance sheet, earnings, regulatory capital and liquidity under a variety of stress scenarios. We perform qualitative risk assessments to identify and assess material risks not fully captured in our forecasts or stress tests. We assess the potential capital impacts of proposed changes to regulatory capital requirements. Management assesses ICAAP results and provides documented quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our capital guidelines and capital position to the Board or its committees. The Corporation periodically reviews capital allocated to its businesses and allocates capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. For additional information, see Business Segment Operations on page 25 . CCAR and Capital Planning The Federal Reserve requires BHCs to submit a capital plan and requests for capital actions on an annual basis, consistent with the rules governing the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) capital plan. The CCAR capital plan is the central element of the Federal Reserve's approach to ensure that large BHCs have adequate capital and robust processes for managing their capital. In January 2015, we submitted our 2015 CCAR capital plan and related supervisory stress tests. The requested capital actions included a request to repurchase $4.0 billion of common stock over five quarters beginning in the second quarter of 2015, and to maintain the quarterly common stock dividend at the current rate of $0.05 per share. Based on the information in our January 2015 submission, we exceeded all stressed capital ratio minimum requirements in the severely adverse scenario with more than $20 billion in excess capital after all planned capital actions, a significant improvement from the prior-year CCAR quantitative results. On March 11, 2015, the Federal Reserve advised that it did not object to our 2015 capital plan but gave a conditional non-objection under which we were required to resubmit our CCAR capital plan by September 30, 2015 and address certain weaknesses the Federal Reserve identified in our capital planning process. We have established plans and taken actions which we believe address the identified weaknesses, and we resubmitted our CCAR capital plan on September 30, 2015. The Federal Reserve has 75 days to review our resubmitted CCAR capital plan and our capital planning revisions. Following that review, the Federal Reserve may determine that the capital plan is not adequate or the identified weaknesses are not being satisfactorily addressed, and may restrict our future capital actions. 56 Table of Contents Pending the Federal Reserve's review of the resubmission of our CCAR capital plan, we are permitted to proceed with our stock repurchase program and to maintain our common stock dividend at the current rate. As of September 30, 2015 , in connection with our 2015 CCAR capital plans, we have repurchased approximately $1.6 billion of common stock. The timing and amount of additional common stock repurchases and common stock dividends will continue to be consistent with our 2015 CCAR capital plan and will be subject to the Federal Reserve's review of our submission of a revised capital plan as discussed above. In addition, the timing and amount of common stock repurchases will be subject to various factors, including the Corporation's capital position, liquidity, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock trading price, and general market conditions, and may be suspended at any time. The common stock repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including repurchase plans that satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Regulatory Capital As a financial services holding company, we are subject to regulatory capital rules issued by U.S. banking regulators. On January 1, 2014, we became subject to Basel 3, which includes certain transition provisions through January 1, 2019. The Corporation and its primary affiliated banking entity, BANA, are Advanced approaches institutions under Basel 3. Basel 3 Overview Basel 3 updated the composition of capital and established a Common equity tier 1 capital ratio. Common equity tier 1 capital primarily includes common stock, retained earnings and accumulated OCI. Basel 3 revised minimum capital ratios and buffer requirements, added a supplementary leverage ratio (SLR), and addressed the adequately capitalized minimum requirements under the PCA framework. Finally, Basel 3 established two methods of calculating risk-weighted assets, the Standardized approach and the Advanced approaches. For additional information, see Capital Management Standardized Approach and Capital Management Advanced Approaches on page 59 . As an Advanced approaches institution, under Basel 3, we were required to complete a qualification period (parallel run) to demonstrate compliance with the Basel 3 Advanced approaches to the satisfaction of U.S. banking regulators. We received approval to begin using the Advanced approaches capital framework to determine risk-based capital requirements beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015. As previously disclosed, with the approval to exit parallel run, U.S. banking regulators requested modifications to certain internal analytical models including the wholesale (e.g., commercial) credit models which will increase our risk-weighted assets in the fourth quarter of 2015. All requested modifications to the internal analytical models will be reflected in the risk-based capital ratios in the fourth quarter of 2015. Prior to the requested modification, we estimate that our Common equity tier 1 capital ratio under Basel 3 Advanced approaches on a fully phased-in basis would have been approximately 11.0 percent at September 30, 2015 . Having exited parallel run on October 1, 2015, with the requested modifications to these models fully incorporated, the pro-forma Common equity tier 1 capital ratio under the Basel 3 Advanced approaches on a fully phased-in basis would have been an estimated 9.7 percent at September 30, 2015 . In the fourth quarter of 2015, we will be required to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and risk-weighted assets under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is to be used to assess capital adequacy including under the PCA framework. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2015, we are required to report our capital adequacy under the Standardized approach only. Regulatory Capital Composition Basel 3 requires certain deductions from and adjustments to capital, which are primarily those related to MSRs, deferred tax assets and defined benefit pension assets. Also, any assets that are a direct deduction from the computation of capital are excluded from risk-weighted assets and adjusted average total assets. Basel 3 also provides for the inclusion in capital of net unrealized gains and losses on AFS debt and certain marketable equity securities recorded in accumulated OCI. These changes are impacted by, among other factors, fluctuations in interest rates, earnings performance and corporate actions. Under Basel 3 regulatory capital transition provisions, changes to the composition of regulatory capital are generally recognized in 20 percent annual increments, and will be fully recognized as of January 1, 2018. 57 Table of Contents Table 19 summarizes how certain regulatory capital deductions and adjustments have been or will be transitioned from 2014 through 2018 for Common equity tier 1 and Tier 1 capital. Table 19 Summary of Certain Basel 3 Regulatory Capital Transition Provisions Beginning on January 1 of each year 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Common equity tier 1 capital Percent of total amount deducted from Common equity tier 1 capital includes: 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Deferred tax assets arising from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards; intangibles, other than mortgage servicing rights and goodwill; defined benefit pension fund net assets; net unrealized cumulative gains (losses) related to changes in own credit risk on liabilities, including derivatives, measured at fair value; direct and indirect investments in our own Common equity tier 1 capital instruments; certain amounts exceeding the threshold by 10 percent individually and 15 percent in aggregate Percent of total amount used to adjust Common equity tier 1 capital includes (1) : 80% 60% 40% 20% 0% Net unrealized gains (losses) on AFS debt and certain marketable equity securities recorded in accumulated OCI; employee benefit plan adjustments recorded in accumulated OCI Tier 1 capital Percent of total amount deducted from Tier 1 capital includes: 80% 60% 40% 20% 0% Deferred tax assets arising from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards; defined benefit pension fund net assets; net unrealized cumulative gains (losses) related to changes in own credit risk on liabilities, including derivatives, measured at fair value (1) Represents the phase-out percentage of the exclusion by year (e.g., 20 percent of net unrealized gains (losses) on AFS debt and certain marketable equity securities recorded in accumulated OCI was included in 2014). Additionally, Basel 3 revised the regulatory capital treatment for Trust Securities, requiring them to be transitioned from Tier 1 capital into Tier 2 capital in 2014 and 2015, until fully excluded from Tier 1 capital in 2016, and transitioned from Tier 2 capital beginning in 2016 with the full exclusion in 2022. As of September 30, 2015 , our qualifying Trust Securities were $1.4 billion , approximately 10 bps of the Tier 1 capital ratio. Minimum Capital Requirements Minimum capital requirements and related buffers are being phased in from January 1, 2014 through January 1, 2019. Effective January 1, 2015, the PCA framework was also amended to reflect the requirements of Basel 3. The PCA framework establishes categories of capitalization, including "well capitalized," based on regulatory ratio requirements. U.S. banking regulators are required to take certain mandatory actions depending on the category of capitalization, with no mandatory actions required for "well-capitalized" banking organizations, which included BANA at September 30, 2015 . Also effective January 1, 2015, Common equity tier 1 capital is included in the measurement of "well capitalized" for depository institutions. Beginning January 1, 2016, we will be subject to a capital conservation buffer, a countercyclical capital buffer and a G-SIB surcharge which will be phased in over a three-year period ending January 1, 2019. Once fully phased in, the Corporation's risk-based capital ratio requirements will include a capital conservation buffer greater than 2.5 percent, plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer and G-SIB surcharge in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. The buffers and surcharge must be composed solely of Common equity tier 1 capital. The countercyclical capital buffer is currently set at zero. U.S. banking regulators must jointly decide on any increase in the countercyclical buffer, after which time institutions will have up to one year for implementation. Based on the Federal Reserve final rule published in July 2015, under certain assumptions, we estimate that our G-SIB surcharge will increase our risk-based capital ratio requirements by 3.0 percent. For more information on our G-SIB surcharge, see Capital Management Regulatory Developments on page 65 . 58 Table of Contents Table 20 presents regulatory minimum and "well-capitalized" ratio requirements in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized Transition as measured at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . Table 20 Bank of America Corporation Regulatory Capital Ratio Requirements under Basel 3 Standardized Transition September 30, 2015 December 31, 2014 Regulatory Minimum (1) Well-capitalized (2) Regulatory Minimum (1) Well-capitalized (2) Common equity tier 1 4.5 % n/a 4.0 % n/a Tier 1 capital 6.0 6.0 % 5.5 6.0 % Total capital 8.0 10.0 8.0 10.0 Tier 1 leverage 4.0 n/a 4.0 n/a (1) When presented on a fully phased-in basis, beginning January 1, 2019, the minimum Basel 3 risk-based capital ratio requirements for the Corporation are expected to significantly increase. For additional information, see Table 24 . (2) To be "well capitalized" under current U.S. banking regulatory agency definitions, a bank holding company must maintain these or higher ratios and not be subject to a Federal Reserve order or directive to maintain higher capital levels. n/a = not applicable Standardized Approach Total risk-weighted assets under the Basel 3 Standardized approach consist of credit risk and market risk measures. Credit risk-weighted assets are measured by applying fixed risk weights to on- and off-balance sheet exposures (excluding securitizations), determined based on the characteristics of the exposure, such as type of obligor, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) country risk code and maturity, among others. Off-balance sheet exposures primarily include financial guarantees, unfunded lending commitments, letters of credit and potential future derivative exposures. Market risk applies to covered positions which include trading assets and liabilities, foreign exchange exposures and commodity exposures. Market risk capital is modeled for general market risk and specific risk for products where specific risk regulatory approval has been granted; in the absence of specific risk model approval, standard specific risk charges apply. For securitization exposures, risk-weighted assets are determined using the Simplified Supervisory Formula Approach (SSFA). Under the Standardized approach, no distinction is made for variations in credit quality for corporate exposures, and the economic benefit of collateral is restricted to a limited list of eligible securities and cash. Advanced Approaches In addition to the credit risk and market risk measures, Basel 3 Advanced approaches include measures of operational risk and risks related to the credit valuation adjustment (CVA) for over-the-counter (OTC) derivative exposures. The Advanced approaches rely on internal analytical models to measure risk weights for credit risk exposures and allow the use of models to estimate the exposure at default (EAD) for certain exposure types. Market risk capital measurements are consistent with the Standardized approach, except for securitization exposures. For both trading and non-trading securitization exposures, institutions are permitted to use the Supervisory Formula Approach (SFA) and would use the SSFA if the SFA is unavailable for a particular exposure. Non-securitization credit risk exposures are measured using internal ratings-based models to determine the applicable risk weight by estimating the probability of default, loss given default (LGD) and, in certain instances, EAD. The internal analytical models primarily rely on internal historical default and loss experience. Operational risk is measured using internal analytical models which rely on both internal and external operational loss experience and data. The calculations require management to make estimates, assumptions and interpretations, including with respect to the probability of future events based on historical experience. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. Under the Federal Reserve's reservation of authority, they may require us to hold an amount of capital greater than otherwise required under the capital rules if they determine that our risk-based capital requirement using our internal analytical models is not commensurate with our credit, market, operational or other risks. Supplementary Leverage Ratio Basel 3 also requires Advanced approaches institutions to disclose a SLR. The numerator of the SLR is quarter-end Basel 3 Tier 1 capital. The denominator is total leverage exposure based on the daily average of the sum of on-balance sheet exposures less permitted Tier 1 deductions, as well as the simple average of certain off-balance sheet exposures, as of the end of each month in a quarter. Off-balance sheet exposures primarily include undrawn lending commitments, letters of credit, OTC derivatives and repo-style transactions. Total leverage exposure includes the effective notional principal amount of credit derivatives and similar instruments through which credit protection is sold. The credit conversion factors (CCFs) applied to certain off-balance sheet exposures conform to the graduated CCF utilized under the Basel 3 Standardized approach, but are subject to a minimum 10 percent CCF. Effective January 1, 2018, the Corporation will be required to maintain a minimum SLR of 3.0 percent, plus a supplementary leverage buffer of 2.0 percent, in order 59 Table of Contents to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses. Insured depository institution subsidiaries of BHCs, including BANA, will be required to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be considered "well capitalized" under the PCA framework. As of September 30, 2015 , the Corporation's estimated SLR on a fully phased-in basis was 6.4 percent, which exceeds the 5.0 percent threshold that represents the minimum plus the supplementary leverage buffer for BHCs. The estimated SLR for BANA on a fully phased-in basis was 7.0 percent, which exceeds the 6.0 percent "well-capitalized" level for insured depository institutions of BHCs. Capital Composition and Ratios Table 21 presents Bank of America Corporation's capital ratios and related information in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized Transition as measured at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . As of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 , the Corporation meets the definition of "well capitalized" under current regulatory requirements.

(2) Reflects adjusted average total assets for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . Common equity tier 1 capital under Basel 3 Standardized Transition was $161.6 billion at September 30, 2015 , an increase of $6.3 billion compared to December 31, 2014 driven by earnings, partially offset by dividends, common stock repurchases and the impact of certain transition provisions under Basel 3 Standardized Transition. For more information on Basel 3 transition provisions, see Table 19 . During the nine months ended September 30, 2015 , Total capital increased $11.2 billion primarily driven by the same factors that drove the increase in Common equity tier 1 capital as well as issuances of preferred stock and subordinated debt. The Tier 1 leverage ratio increased 35 bps compared to December 31, 2014 primarily driven by an increase in Tier 1 capital. For additional information, see Table 22 . Risk-weighted assets increased $130 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $1,392 billion primarily due to the change in the calculation of risk-weighted assets from the general risk-based approach at December 31, 2014 to the Basel 3 Standardized approach. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015 , on a pro-forma basis under Basel 3 Standardized Transition, risk-weighted assets of $1,392 billion remained unchanged compared to December 31, 2014 . At September 30, 2015 , an increase or decrease in our Common equity tier 1, Tier 1 or Total capital ratios by one bp would require a change of $139 million in Common equity tier 1, Tier 1 or Total capital. We could also increase our Common equity tier 1, Tier 1 or Total capital ratios by one bp on such date by a reduction in risk-weighted assets of $1.2 billion, $1.1 billion and $880 million, respectively. An increase in our Tier 1 leverage ratio by one bp on such date would require $209 million of additional Tier 1 capital or a reduction of $2.4 billion in adjusted average assets. 60 Table of Contents Table 22 presents the capital composition as measured under Basel 3 Standardized Transition at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 .

The Common equity tier 1, Tier 1 and Total capital estimates reflect the full impact of Basel 3 changes to capital composition after the transition period ends on January 1, 2019. These changes include certain deductions from and adjustments to capital, the most significant of which relate to deferred tax assets, and the inclusion of net unrealized gains and losses on AFS debt and certain marketable equity securities recorded in accumulated OCI. These ratios are considered non-GAAP financial measures until the end of the transition period on January 1, 2019 when adopted and required by U.S. banking regulators.

With the approval to exit parallel run, we will be required to report regulatory capital risk-weighted assets and ratios under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is to be used to assess capital adequacy. Prior to exiting parallel run, we were required to report regulatory capital risk-weighted assets and ratios under the Standardized approach only. As previously disclosed, with the approval to exit parallel run, U.S. banking regulators requested modifications to certain internal analytical models including the wholesale (e.g., commercial) credit models which will increase our risk-weighted assets in the fourth quarter of 2015. (2) Basel 3 Advanced approaches estimates assume approval by U.S. banking regulators of our internal analytical models. We are working to obtain approval from our regulators of the internal models methodology (IMM).

With the approval to exit parallel run, we will be required to report regulatory capital risk-weighted assets and ratios under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is to be used to assess capital adequacy. Prior to exiting parallel run, we were required to report regulatory capital risk-weighted assets and ratios under the Standardized approach only. As previously disclosed, with the approval to exit parallel run, U.S. banking regulators requested modifications to certain internal analytical models including the wholesale (e.g., commercial) credit models which will increase our risk-weighted assets in the fourth quarter of 2015.

Regulatory Capital Table 27 presents regulatory capital information for BANA in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized Transition as measured at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . Table 27 Bank of America, N.A. Regulatory Capital under Basel 3 Standardized Transition September 30, 2015 December 31, 2014 (Dollars in millions) Ratio Amount Minimum Required (1) Ratio Amount Minimum Required (1) Common equity tier 1 capital 12.5 % $ 144,880 6.5 % 13.1 % $ 145,150 4.0 % Tier 1 capital 12.5 144,880 8.0 13.1 145,150 6.0 Total capital 13.8 160,331 10.0 14.6 161,623 10.0 Tier 1 leverage 9.3 144,880 5.0 9.6 145,150 5.0 (1) Percent required to meet guidelines to be considered "well capitalized" under the Prompt Corrective Action framework, except for the December 31, 2014 Common equity tier 1 capital which reflects capital adequacy minimum requirements as an Advanced approaches bank under Basel 3 during a transition period that ended in 2014. BANA's Common equity tier 1 capital ratio under Basel 3 Standardized Transition was 12.5 percent at September 30, 2015 , a decrease of 66 bps from December 31, 2014 , primarily driven by dividends to the parent company and the change in the calculation of risk-weighted assets from the general risk-based approach at December 31, 2014 to the Basel 3 Standardized approach, partially offset by earnings. The Total capital ratio decreased 82 bps to 13.8 percent at September 30, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014 and the Tier 1 leverage ratio decreased 29 bps to 9.3 percent . The decrease in the Total capital ratio was driven by the same factors as the Common equity tier 1 capital ratio. The decrease in the Tier 1 leverage ratio was primarily driven by an increase in adjusted quarterly average total assets. Regulatory Developments Global Systemically Important Bank Surcharge We have been designated as a global systemically important bank (G-SIB) and as such, are subject to a risk-based capital surcharge (G-SIB surcharge) that must be satisfied with Common equity tier 1 capital. The surcharge assessment methodology published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) relies on an indicator-based measurement approach (e.g., size, complexity, cross-jurisdictional activity, inter-connectedness and substitutability/financial institution infrastructure) to determine a score relative to the global banking industry. Institutions with the highest scores are designated as G-SIBs and are assigned to one of four loss absorbency buckets from 1.0 percent to 2.5 percent, in 0.5 percent increments based on each institution's relative score and supervisory judgment. A fifth loss absorbency bucket of 3.5 percent serves to discourage banks from becoming more systemically important. In July 2015, the Federal Reserve finalized a regulation that will implement G-SIB surcharge requirements for the largest U.S. BHCs. Under the final rule, assignment to loss absorbency buckets will be determined by the higher score as calculated according to two methods. Method 1 is consistent with the Basel Committee's methodology, whereas Method 2 replaces the substitutability/financial institution infrastructure indicator with a measure of short-term wholesale funding and then determines the overall score by applying a fixed multiplier for each of the other systemic indicators. Under the final U.S. rules, the G-SIB surcharge will be phased in beginning on January 1, 2016, becoming fully effective on January 1, 2019. We estimate that our G-SIB surcharge will increase our risk-based capital ratio requirements by 3.0 percent under Method 2 and 1.5 percent under Method 1. For more information on regulatory capital, see Note 16 Regulatory Requirements and Restrictions to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 65 Table of Contents Minimum Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity In November 2014, the FSB proposed standards for the total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) that G-SIBs would be required to maintain in order to facilitate an orderly resolution in the event of failure. The proposal would require G-SIBs to hold sufficient amounts of qualifying regulatory capital and debt instruments to help ensure recapitalization and continuity of critical functions upon a resolution without imposing losses on taxpayers or threatening financial stability. Under the proposal, a G-SIB would be required to maintain minimum TLAC of 16.0 percent to 20.0 percent of risk-weighted assets, excluding regulatory Common equity tier 1 capital buffers, at least twice the minimum Basel 3 Tier 1 leverage ratio and at least 33 percent of the minimum TLAC requirement in the form of eligible long-term debt. The FSB intends to submit a final revised proposal recommendation to the Group of Twenty (G-20) in November 2015. On October 30, 2015, the Federal Reserve voted to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking which establishes external TLAC requirements for U.S. BHCs designated as G-SIBs. Under the proposal by the Federal Reserve, U.S. G-SIBs would be required to maintain a minimum external TLAC of 16 percent of risk-weighted assets, excluding regulatory buffers, in 2019, increasing to the greater of 18 percent of risk-weighted assets, excluding regulatory buffers, and 9.5 percent of the denominator of the SLR in 2022. In addition, U.S. G-SIBs must meet the external TLAC requirement with minimum eligible long-term debt equal to the greater of 6 percent of risk-weighted assets plus the G-SIB surcharge, and 4.5 percent of the denominator of the SLR. We continue to monitor and evaluate developments and impacts related to this proposal. Revisions to Approaches for Measuring Risk-weighted Assets The Basel Committee has several open proposals to revise key methodologies for measuring risk-weighted assets. The proposals include a fundamental review of the trading book, which would update market risk measurement, and revisions to the CVA risk framework. The proposed revisions affect both modeled and standardized approaches for measuring market risk and CVA risk. The Basel Committee has also proposed revisions to the standardized approach for credit risk and the standardized approaches for operational risk. A revised standardized model for counterparty credit risk has previously been finalized. These revisions would be coupled with a proposed capital floor framework to limit the extent to which banks can reduce risk-weighted asset levels through the use of internal models. The Basel Committee expects to finalize the outstanding proposals by the end of 2016. Once the proposals are finalized, U.S. banking regulators may update the U.S. Basel 3 rules to incorporate the Basel Committee revisions. Broker-dealer Regulatory Capital and Securities Regulation The Corporation's principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith (MLPF&S) and Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp (MLPCC). MLPCC is a fully-guaranteed subsidiary of MLPF&S and provides clearing and settlement services. Both entities are subject to the net capital requirements of SEC Rule 15c3-1. Both entities are also registered as futures commission merchants and are subject to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Regulation 1.17. MLPF&S has elected to compute the minimum capital requirement in accordance with the Alternative Net Capital Requirement as permitted by SEC Rule 15c3-1. At September 30, 2015 , MLPF&S's regulatory net capital as defined by Rule 15c3-1 was $10.1 billion and exceeded the minimum requirement of $1.4 billion by $8.7 billion. MLPCC's net capital of $3.2 billion exceeded the minimum requirement of $365 million by $2.8 billion. In accordance with the Alternative Net Capital Requirements, MLPF&S is required to maintain tentative net capital in excess of $1.0 billion, net capital in excess of $500 million and notify the SEC in the event its tentative net capital is less than $5.0 billion. At September 30, 2015 , MLPF&S had tentative net capital and net capital in excess of the minimum and notification requirements. Merrill Lynch International (MLI), a U.K. investment firm, is regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority, and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. At September 30, 2015 , MLI's capital resources were $34.3 billion which exceeded the minimum requirement of $16.8 billion. 66 Table of Contents Common and Preferred Stock Dividends For a summary of our declared quarterly cash dividends on common stock during the third quarter of 2015 and through October 30, 2015 , see Note 11 Shareholders' Equity to the Consolidated Financial Statements .

Liquidity Risk Funding and Liquidity Risk Management We define liquidity risk as the potential inability to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations, on- or off-balance sheet, as they come due. Our primary liquidity risk management objective is to meet all contractual and contingent financial obligations at all times, including during periods of stress. To achieve that objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk under expected and stressed conditions, maintain excess liquidity and access to diverse funding sources, including our stable deposit base, and seek to align liquidity-related incentives and risks. We define excess liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we can use to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations as those obligations arise. We manage our liquidity position through line of business and asset-liability management activities, as well as through our legal entity funding strategy, on both a forward and current (including intraday) basis under both expected and stressed conditions. We believe that a centralized approach to funding and liquidity risk management within Corporate Treasury enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding sources, minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events. For more information regarding global funding and liquidity risk management, see Liquidity Risk Funding and Liquidity Risk Management on page 65 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Global Excess Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets We maintain excess liquidity available to Bank of America Corporation, including the parent company and selected subsidiaries, in the form of cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Our liquidity buffer, or Global Excess Liquidity Sources (GELS), is comprised of assets that are readily available to the parent company and selected subsidiaries, including bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, even during stressed market conditions. Our cash is primarily on deposit with the Federal Reserve and, to a lesser extent, central banks outside of the U.S. We limit the composition of high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities to U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency MBS and a select group of non-U.S. government and supranational securities. We believe we can quickly obtain cash for these securities, even in stressed conditions, through repurchase agreements or outright sales. We hold our GELS in legal entities that allow us to meet the liquidity requirements of our global businesses, and we consider the impact of potential regulatory, tax, legal and other restrictions that could limit the transferability of funds among entities. Our GELS are substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the final LCR rules. For more information on the final rules, see Liquidity Risk Basel 3 Liquidity Standards on page 70 . 68 Table of Contents Our GELS were $499 billion and $439 billion at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 and were maintained as shown in Table 29 . Table 29 Global Excess Liquidity Sources (Dollars in billions) September 30 2015 December 31 2014 Average for Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 Parent company $ 98 $ 98 $ 97 Bank subsidiaries 354 306 359 Other regulated entities 47 35 42 Total Global Excess Liquidity Sources $ 499 $ 439 $ 498 As shown in Table 29 , parent company GELS totaled $98 billion at both September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . Parent company liquidity remained unchanged as subsidiary inflows and debt issuances were largely offset by debt maturities and derivative collateral outflows. Typically, parent company excess liquidity is in the form of cash deposited with BANA. GELS available to our bank subsidiaries totaled $354 billion and $306 billion at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . The increase in bank subsidiaries' liquidity was primarily due to deposit inflows and net debt issuances, partially offset by loan growth. GELS at bank subsidiaries exclude the cash deposited by the parent company. Our bank subsidiaries can also generate incremental liquidity by pledging a range of other unencumbered loans and securities to certain Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against this pool of specifically-identified eligible assets was approximately $239 billion and $214 billion at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . We have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against these assets, including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loans and securities collateral. Eligibility is defined in guidelines from the FHLBs and the Federal Reserve and is subject to change at their discretion. Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries can generally be used only to fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries and can only be transferred to the parent company or nonbank subsidiaries with prior regulatory approval. GELS available to our other regulated entities, comprised primarily of broker-dealer subsidiaries, totaled $47 billion and $35 billion at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . The increase in liquidity in other regulated entities is largely driven by parent company liquidity contributions to the Corporation's primary U.S. broker-dealer. Our other regulated entities also held other unencumbered investment-grade securities and equities that we believe could be used to generate additional liquidity. Liquidity held in an other regulated entity is primarily available to meet the obligations of that entity and transfers to the parent company or to any other subsidiary may be subject to prior regulatory approval due to regulatory restrictions and minimum requirements. Table 30 presents the composition of GELS at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . Table 30 Global Excess Liquidity Sources Composition (Dollars in billions) September 30 2015 December 31 2014 Cash on deposit $ 130 $ 97 U.S. Treasury securities 49 74 U.S. agency securities and mortgage-backed securities 299 252 Non-U.S. government and supranational securities 21 16 Total Global Excess Liquidity Sources $ 499 $ 439 Time-to-required Funding and Stress Modeling We use a variety of metrics to determine the appropriate amounts of excess liquidity to maintain at the parent company, our bank subsidiaries and other regulated entities. One metric we use to evaluate the appropriate level of excess liquidity at the parent company is "time-to-required funding." This debt coverage measure indicates the number of months that the parent company can continue to meet its unsecured contractual obligations as they come due using only the parent company's liquidity sources without issuing any new debt or accessing any additional liquidity sources. We define unsecured contractual obligations for purposes of this metric as maturities of senior or subordinated debt issued or guaranteed by Bank of America Corporation. These include certain unsecured debt instruments, primarily structured liabilities, which we may be required to settle for cash prior to maturity. Our time-to-required funding was 42 months at September 30, 2015 . For purposes of calculating time-to-required funding at September 30, 2015 , we have included in the amount of 69 Table of Contents unsecured contractual obligations $8.6 billion related to the BNY Mellon Settlement. The final conditions of the settlement have been satisfied, requiring the Corporation to make the settlement payment on or before February 9, 2016. For more information on the BNY Mellon Settlement, see Note 7 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements . We also utilize liquidity stress analysis to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of excess liquidity to maintain at the parent company, our bank subsidiaries and other regulated entities. The liquidity stress testing process is an integral part of analyzing our potential contractual and contingent cash outflows beyond the outflows considered in the time-to-required funding analysis. We evaluate the liquidity requirements under a range of scenarios with varying levels of severity and time horizons. The scenarios we consider and utilize incorporate market-wide and Corporation-specific events, including potential credit rating downgrades for the parent company and our subsidiaries, and are based on historical experience, regulatory guidance, and both expected and unexpected future events. The types of potential contractual and contingent cash outflows we consider in our scenarios may include, but are not limited to, upcoming contractual maturities of unsecured debt and reductions in new debt issuance; diminished access to secured financing markets; potential deposit withdrawals; increased draws on loan commitments, liquidity facilities and letters of credit; additional collateral that counterparties could call if our credit ratings were downgraded; collateral and margin requirements arising from market value changes; and potential liquidity required to maintain businesses and finance customer activities. Changes in certain market factors including, but not limited to, credit rating downgrades, could negatively impact potential contractual and contingent outflows and the related financial instruments, and in some cases these impacts could be material to our financial results. We consider all sources of funds that we could access during each stress scenario and focus particularly on matching available sources with corresponding liquidity requirements by legal entity. We also use the stress modeling results to manage our asset-liability profile and establish limits and guidelines on certain funding sources and businesses. Basel 3 Liquidity Standards The Basel Committee has issued two liquidity risk-related standards that are considered part of the Basel 3 liquidity standards: the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR). In 2014, U.S. banking regulators finalized LCR requirements for the largest U.S. financial institutions on a consolidated basis and for their subsidiary depository institutions with total assets greater than $10 billion. The LCR is calculated as the amount of a financial institution's unencumbered HQLA relative to the estimated net cash outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period of significant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. Under the final rule, an initial minimum LCR of 80 percent was required as of January 2015, and will increase thereafter in 10 percentage point increments annually through January 2017. These minimum requirements are applicable to the Corporation on a consolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions. As of September 30, 2015 , we estimate that the consolidated Corporation was above the 2017 LCR requirements. The Corporation's LCR may fluctuate from period to period due to normal business flows from customer activity. In 2014, the Basel Committee issued a final standard for the NSFR, the standard that is intended to reduce funding risk over a longer time horizon. The NSFR is designed to ensure an appropriate amount of stable funding, generally capital and liabilities maturing beyond one year, given the mix of assets and off-balance sheet items. The final standard aligns the NSFR to the LCR and gives more credit to a wider range of funding. The final standard also includes adjustments to the stable funding required for certain types of assets, some of which reduce the stable funding requirement and some of which increase it. Basel Committee standards generally do not apply directly to U.S. financial institutions, but require adoption by U.S. banking regulators. U.S. banking regulators are expected to propose a similar NSFR regulation applicable to U.S. financial institutions in the near future. We expect to meet the NSFR requirement within the regulatory timeline. Diversified Funding Sources We fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits and secured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally coordinated funding strategy. We diversify our funding globally across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups. The primary benefits of our centralized funding strategy include greater control, reduced funding costs, wider name recognition by investors and greater flexibility to meet the variable funding requirements of subsidiaries. Where regulations, time zone differences or other business considerations make parent company funding impractical, certain other subsidiaries may issue their own debt. We fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposits, which were $1.16 trillion and $1.12 trillion at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . Deposits are primarily generated by our Consumer Banking, GWIM and Global Banking segments. These deposits are diversified by clients, product type and geography, and the majority of our U.S. deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. We consider a substantial portion of our deposits to be a stable, low-cost and consistent source 70 Table of Contents of funding. We believe this deposit funding is generally less sensitive to interest rate changes, market volatility or changes in our credit ratings than wholesale funding sources. Our lending activities may also be financed through secured borrowings, including credit card securitizations and securitizations with GSEs, the FHA and private-label investors, as well as FHLBs loans. Our trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded on a secured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions. We believe funding these activities in the secured financing markets is more cost-efficient and less sensitive to changes in our credit ratings than unsecured financing. Repurchase agreements are generally short-term and often overnight. Disruptions in secured financing markets for financial institutions have occurred in prior market cycles which resulted in adverse changes in terms or significant reductions in the availability of such financing. We manage the liquidity risks arising from secured funding by sourcing funding globally from a diverse group of counterparties, providing a range of securities collateral and pursuing longer durations, when appropriate. For more information on secured financing agreements, see Note 9 Federal Funds Sold or Purchased, Securities Financing Agreements and Short-term Borrowings to the Consolidated Financial Statements . We issue long-term unsecured debt in a variety of maturities and currencies to achieve cost-efficient funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity profile. While the cost and availability of unsecured funding may be negatively impacted by general market conditions or by matters specific to the financial services industry or the Corporation, we seek to mitigate refinancing risk by actively managing the amount of our borrowings that we anticipate will mature within any month or quarter. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 , we issued $8.3 billion and $34.0 billion of long-term debt, consisting of $6.6 billion and $21.1 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $76 million and $7.7 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $1.6 billion and $5.2 billion of other debt. Table 31 presents the carrying value of aggregate annual contractual maturities of long-term debt as of September 30, 2015 . During the nine months ended September 30, 2015 , we had total long-term debt maturities and purchases of $34.6 billion consisting of $20.6 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $6.3 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $7.7 billion of other debt.

Table 32 Long-term Debt By Major Currency (Dollars in millions) September 30 2015 December 31 2014 U.S. Dollar $ 189,384 $ 191,264 Euro 31,012 30,687 British Pound 7,384 7,881 Japanese Yen 3,632 6,058 Australian Dollar 1,759 2,135 Canadian Dollar 1,492 1,779 Swiss Franc 900 897 Other 1,725 2,438 Total long-term debt $ 237,288 $ 243,139 Total long-term debt decreased $5.9 billion , or two percent , during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to the impact of revaluation of non-U.S. Dollar debt and changes in fair value for debt accounted for under the fair value option. These impacts were substantially offset through derivative hedge transactions. Excluding these two factors, total long-term debt remained relatively unchanged for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 . We may, from time to time, purchase outstanding debt instruments in various transactions, depending on prevailing market conditions, liquidity and other factors. In addition, our other regulated entities may make markets in our debt instruments to provide liquidity for investors. For more information on long-term debt funding, see Note 11 Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K and for more information regarding funding and liquidity risk management, see page 65 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K . We use derivative transactions to manage the duration, interest rate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering the characteristics of the assets they are funding. For further details on our ALM activities, see Interest Rate Risk Management for Non-trading Activities on page 118 . We may also issue unsecured debt in the form of structured notes for client purposes. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 , we issued $1.2 billion and $4.8 billion of structured notes, a majority of which was issued by Bank of America Corporation. Structured notes are debt obligations that pay investors returns linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these liabilities with derivatives and/or investments in the underlying instruments, so that from a funding perspective, the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We could be required to settle certain structured liability obligations for cash or other securities prior to maturity under certain circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning purposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date. We had outstanding structured liabilities with a carrying value of $31.6 billion and $38.8 billion at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price. Contingency Planning We maintain contingency funding plans that outline our potential responses to liquidity stress events at various levels of severity. These policies and plans are based on stress scenarios and include potential funding strategies and communication and notification procedures that we would implement in the event we experienced stressed liquidity conditions. We periodically review and test the contingency funding plans to validate efficacy and assess readiness. Our U.S. bank subsidiaries can access contingency funding through the Federal Reserve Discount Window. Certain non-U.S. subsidiaries have access to central bank facilities in the jurisdictions in which they operate. While we do not rely on these sources in our liquidity modeling, we maintain the policies, procedures and governance processes that would enable us to access these sources if necessary. 72 Table of Contents Credit Ratings Our borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are impacted by our credit ratings. In addition, credit ratings may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions, including OTC derivatives. Thus, it is our objective to maintain high-quality credit ratings, and management maintains an active dialogue with the rating agencies. Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating agencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other securities, including asset securitizations. Our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies, and they consider a number of factors, including our own financial strength, performance, prospects and operations, as well as factors not under our control. The rating agencies could make adjustments to our ratings at any time, and they provide no assurances that they will maintain our ratings at current levels. Other factors that influence our credit ratings include changes to the rating agencies' methodologies for our industry or certain security types; the rating agencies' assessment of the general operating environment for financial services companies; our relative positions in the markets in which we compete; our various risk exposures and risk management policies and activities; pending litigation and other contingencies or potential tail risks; our reputation; our liquidity position, diversity of funding sources and funding costs; the current and expected level and volatility of our earnings; our capital position and capital management practices; our corporate governance; the sovereign credit ratings of the U.S. government; current or future regulatory and legislative initiatives; and the agencies' views on whether the U.S. government would provide meaningful support to the Corporation or its subsidiaries in a crisis. On July 23, 2015, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (S&P) concluded a periodic review of the eight U.S. G-SIBs. As a result, S&P upgraded Bank of America's stand-alone credit profile (SACP) to 'a-' from 'bbb+', reflecting S&P's view that the Corporation's potential legal and regulatory risks have declined, and that it has made steady progress on reducing the size of its legacy mortgage portfolio resulting in lower credit costs and an improved risk profile. S&P concurrently upgraded the ratings of Bank of America Corporation's preferred stock and trust preferred securities to BB+ from BB. S&P also revised the outlook to positive from stable on the ratings of Bank of America's core rated operating subsidiaries, including Bank of America, N.A., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Merrill Lynch International, and Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited. Those entities' long-term and short-term senior debt ratings remain unchanged at A and A-1. S&P also left Bank of America Corporation's long-term and short-term senior debt ratings unchanged at A- and A-2, but retained a negative outlook. The negative outlook on the holding company ratings reflects S&P's ongoing evaluation of whether it deems the U.S. G-SIB resolution regime to be effective and thus eliminates the remaining notch of uplift in those ratings for potential extraordinary government support. The positive outlook on the operating subsidiary ratings reflects the possibility that for those subsidiaries, S&P could offset the elimination of the notch of uplift for government support with two notches of uplift from the agency's implementation of a new framework for incorporating additional loss-absorbing debt and equity capital buffers at the holding company into operating company credit ratings. On May 28, 2015, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (Moody's) concluded its previously announced review of several global investment banking groups, including Bank of America, which followed the publication of the agency's new bank rating methodology. As a result, Moody's upgraded Bank of America Corporation's long-term senior debt rating to Baa1 from Baa2, and the preferred stock rating to Ba2 from Ba3. Moody's also upgraded the long-term senior debt and long-term deposit ratings of Bank of America, N.A. to A1 from A2. Moody's affirmed the short-term ratings at P-2 for Bank of America Corporation and P-1 for Bank of America, N.A. Moody's now has a stable outlook on all of our ratings. On May 19, 2015, Fitch Ratings (Fitch) completed its review of sovereign support for 12 large, complex securities trading and universal banks, including Bank of America. As a result, Fitch revised the support rating floors for the U.S. global systemically important BHCs to No Floor from A, effectively removing the implied government support uplift from those institutions' ratings. The rating agency also upgraded Bank of America Corporation's stand-alone rating, or Viability Rating to 'a' from 'a-', while affirming its long-term and short-term senior debt ratings at A and F1, respectively. Fitch indicated that the upgrade of the Viability Rating was driven by the Corporation's maintenance of good capital and liquidity levels, materially lower potential litigation costs compared to recent years and a gradually improving earnings profile. Fitch concurrently upgraded Bank of America, N.A.'s long-term senior debt rating to A+ from A, and its long-term deposit rating to AA- from A+. Fitch set the outlook on these ratings at stable. Fitch also revised the outlook to positive on the ratings of Bank of America's material international operating subsidiaries, including Merrill Lynch International. 73 Table of Contents Table 33 presents the Corporation's current long-term/short-term senior debt ratings and outlooks expressed by the rating agencies.

In addition, under the terms of certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements, in the event of downgrades of our or our rated subsidiaries' credit ratings, the counterparties to those agreements may require us to provide additional collateral, or to terminate these contracts or agreements, which could cause us to sustain losses and/or adversely impact our liquidity. If the short-term credit ratings of our parent company, bank or broker-dealer subsidiaries were downgraded by one or more levels, the potential loss of access to short-term funding sources such as repo financing and the effect on our incremental cost of funds could be material. While certain potential impacts are contractual and quantifiable, the full scope of the consequences of a credit rating downgrade to a financial institution is inherently uncertain, as it depends upon numerous dynamic, complex and inter-related factors and assumptions, including whether any downgrade of a company's long-term credit ratings precipitates downgrades to its short-term credit ratings, and assumptions about the potential behaviors of various customers, investors and counterparties. For more information on potential impacts of credit rating downgrades, see Liquidity Risk Time-to-required Funding and Stress Modeling on page 69 . For more information on the additional collateral and termination payments that could be required in connection with certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements as a result of such a credit rating downgrade, see Note 2 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein and Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 74 Table of Contents Credit Risk Management Credit quality remained strong in the third quarter of 2015 driven by lower U.S. unemployment and improving home prices as well as our proactive credit risk management activities positively impacting our credit portfolio as nonperforming loans and leases and delinquencies continued to improve. For additional information, see Executive Summary Third Quarter 2015 Economic and Business Environment on page 4 . We proactively refine our underwriting and credit risk management practices as well as credit standards to meet the changing economic environment. To actively mitigate losses and enhance customer support in our consumer businesses, we have in place collection programs and loan modification and customer assistance infrastructures. We utilize a number of actions to mitigate losses in the commercial businesses including increasing the frequency and intensity of portfolio monitoring, hedging activity and our practice of transferring management of deteriorating commercial exposures to independent special asset officers as credits enter criticized categories. We have non-U.S. exposure largely in Europe and Asia Pacific. For more information on our exposures and related risks in non-U.S. countries, see Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 106 and Item 1A.

Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Credit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower's credit cycle. Statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio management including underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting credit limits, and establishing operating processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns. Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources such as credit bureaus and/or internal historical experience. These models are a component of our consumer credit risk management process and are used in part to assist in making both new and ongoing credit decisions, as well as portfolio management strategies, including authorizations and line management, collection practices and strategies, and determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allocated capital for credit risk. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015 , we completed approximately 41,600 customer loan modifications with a total unpaid principal balance of approximately $7.0 billion, including approximately 17,700 permanent modifications, under the U.S. government's Making Home Affordable Program. Of the loan modifications completed during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 , in terms of both the volume of modifications and the unpaid principal balance associated with the underlying loans, more than half were in the Corporation's held-for-investment (HFI) portfolio. For modified loans on our balance sheet, these modification types are generally considered troubled debt restructurings (TDR). For more information on TDRs and portfolio impacts, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Nonperforming Consumer Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity on page 92 and Note 4 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Consumer Credit Portfolio Improvement in the U.S. unemployment rate and home prices continued during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 resulting in improved credit quality and lower credit losses across most major consumer portfolios compared to the same periods in 2014 . Nearly all consumer loan portfolios 30 and 90 days or more past due declined during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as a result of improved delinquency trends. Although home prices have shown steady improvement since the beginning of 2012, they have not fully recovered to their 2006 levels. Improved credit quality, continued loan balance run-off and sales across the consumer portfolio drove a $2.0 billion decrease in the consumer allowance for loan and lease losses during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $8.0 billion at September 30, 2015 . For additional information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 108 . 75 Table of Contents For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, charge-offs and TDRs for the consumer portfolio, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K .

Nonperforming loans do not include past due consumer credit card loans, other unsecured loans and in general, consumer non-real estate-secured loans (loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy are included) as these loans are typically charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due. Real estate-secured past due consumer loans that are insured by the FHA or individually insured under long-term standby agreements with FNMA and FHLMC (collectively, the fully-insured loan portfolio) are reported as accruing as opposed to nonperforming since the principal repayment is insured. Fully-insured loans included in accruing past due 90 days or more are primarily from our repurchases of delinquent FHA loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA. Additionally, nonperforming loans and accruing balances past due 90 days or more do not include the PCI loan portfolio or loans accounted for under the fair value option even though the customer may be contractually past due.

(2) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as annualized net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans and leases excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option. Net charge-off ratios, excluding the PCI and fully-insured loan portfolios, were 0.08 percent and 0.39 percent for residential mortgage, 0.64 percent and 0.77 percent for home equity, and 0.82 percent and 1.00 percent for the total consumer portfolio for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 , respectively. Net charge-off ratios, excluding the PCI and fully-insured loan portfolios, were 0.15 percent and 0.14 percent for residential mortgage, 0.43 percent and 1.00 percent for home equity, and 0.90 percent and 1.07 percent for the total consumer portfolio for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 , respectively. These are the only product classifications that include PCI and fully-insured loans for these periods. Net charge-offs, as shown in Tables 36 and 37 , exclude write-offs in the PCI loan portfolio of $128 million and $580 million in residential mortgage and $20 million and $146 million in home equity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 , and $196 million and $547 million in residential mortgage and $50 million and $250 million in home equity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 .

Consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option include residential mortgage loans of $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion and home equity loans of $225 million and $196 million at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . For more information on the fair value option, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Consumer Loans Accounted for Under the Fair Value Option on page 91 and Note 15 Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements . (2) Net charge-offs exclude write-offs in the PCI loan portfolio. Write-offs in the PCI loan portfolio decrease the PCI valuation allowance included as part of the allowance for loan and lease losses. For more information on PCI write-offs, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio on page 87 . 79 Table of Contents We believe that the presentation of information adjusted to exclude the impact of the PCI loan portfolio, the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option is more representative of the ongoing operations and credit quality of the business. As a result, in the following discussions of the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios, we provide information that excludes the impact of the PCI loan portfolio, the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option in certain credit quality statistics. We separately disclose information on the PCI loan portfolio on page 87 . Residential Mortgage The residential mortgage portfolio makes up the largest percentage of our consumer loan portfolio at 41 percent of consumer loans and leases at September 30, 2015 . Approximately 60 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio is in All Other and is comprised of originated loans, purchased loans used in our overall ALM activities, delinquent FHA loans repurchased pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA as well as loans repurchased related to our representations and warranties. Approximately 29 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio is in GWIM and represents residential mortgages originated for the home purchase and refinancing needs of our wealth management clients and the remaining portion of the portfolio is primarily in Consumer Banking . Outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, decreased $28.3 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to loan sales of $23.6 billion, including $16.4 billion of loans with standby insurance agreements, $2.5 billion of nonperforming and other delinquent loans, $4.5 billion of loans in consolidated agency residential mortgage securitization vehicles, and runoff outpacing the retention of new originations. These declines were partially offset by repurchases of delinquent loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA, which are part of our mortgage banking activities. At September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 , the residential mortgage portfolio included $38.6 billion and $65.0 billion of outstanding fully-insured loans. On this portion of the residential mortgage portfolio, we are protected against principal loss as a result of either FHA insurance or long-term standby agreements with FNMA and FHLMC. At September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 , $35.6 billion and $47.8 billion had FHA insurance with the remainder protected by long-term standby agreements. At September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 , $12.4 billion and $15.9 billion of the FHA-insured loan population were repurchases of delinquent FHA loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA. The long-term standby agreements with FNMA and FHLMC reduce our regulatory risk-weighted assets due to the transfer of a portion of our credit risk to unaffiliated parties. At September 30, 2015 , these programs had the cumulative effect of reducing our risk-weighted assets by $904 million, and increasing both our Tier 1 capital ratio and Common equity tier 1 capital ratio by one bp under the Basel 3 Standardized Transition. This compared to reducing our risk-weighted assets by $5.2 billion, and increasing both our Tier 1 capital ratio and Tier 1 Common capital ratio by five bps at December 31, 2014 under Basel 3 Standardized Transition. 80 Table of Contents Table 38 presents certain residential mortgage key credit statistics on both a reported basis excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, and excluding the PCI loan portfolio, our fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option. Additionally, in the "Reported Basis" columns in the table below, accruing balances past due and nonperforming loans do not include the PCI loan portfolio, in accordance with our accounting policies, even though the customer may be contractually past due. As such, the following discussion presents the residential mortgage portfolio excluding the PCI loan portfolio, the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option. For more information on the PCI loan portfolio, see page 87 .

There were $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion of residential mortgage loans accounted for under the fair value option at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . For more information on the fair value option, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Consumer Loans Accounted for Under the Fair Value Option on page 91 and Note 15 Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements . (2) These vintages of loans account for $1.9 billion, or 36 percent , and $2.8 billion, or 41 percent of nonperforming residential mortgage loans at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 , these vintages accounted for $4 million of recoveries, and $114 million , or 29 percent of total residential mortgage net charge-offs. For the three months ended September 30, 2014 , these vintages accounted for $13 million , or 26 percent of total residential mortgage net charge-offs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2014 , these vintages accounted for no residential mortgage net charge-offs. (3) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as annualized net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option. Nonperforming residential mortgage loans decreased $1.6 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 including sales of $1.2 billion, partially offset by a $246 million net increase related to the settlement with the DoJ for those loans that are no longer fully insured. Excluding these items, nonperforming residential mortgage loans decreased as outflows, including the transfer of certain qualifying borrowers discharged in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy to performing status, outpaced new inflows. Of the nonperforming residential mortgage loans at September 30, 2015 , $1.8 billion, or 34 percent, were current on contractual payments. Nonperforming loans that are contractually current primarily consist of collateral-dependent TDRs, including those that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, as well as loans that have not yet demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance following a TDR. In addition, $2.3 billion, or 43 percent of nonperforming residential mortgage loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell. Accruing loans that were 30 days or more past due decreased $215 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 . 81 Table of Contents Net charge-offs decreased $27 million to $26 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 , or 0.08 percent of total average residential mortgage loans, compared to net charge-offs of $53 million , or 0.15 percent , for the same period in 2014 . This decrease in net charge-offs was primarily driven by higher recoveries of $57 million related to nonperforming loan sales during the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $39 million for the same period in 2014, favorable portfolio trends and decreased write-downs on loans greater than 180 days past due, which were written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell, due in part to improvement in home prices and the U.S. economy. These improvements were partially offset by $49 million of net charge-offs during the three months ended September 30, 2015 related to the consumer relief portion of the settlement with the DoJ. Net charge-offs increased $255 million to $400 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 , or 0.39 percent of total average residential mortgage loans, compared to net charge-offs of $145 million , or 0.14 percent , for the same period in 2014 . This increase in net charge-offs was primarily driven by $379 million of charge-offs during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 related to the consumer relief portion of the settlement with the DoJ. In addition, net charge-offs included recoveries of $119 million related to nonperforming loan sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $224 million for the same period in 2014. Excluding these items, net charge-offs declined driven by favorable portfolio trends and decreased write-downs on loans greater than 180 days past due, which were written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell, due in part to improvement in home prices and the U.S. economy. Residential mortgage loans with a greater than 90 percent but less than or equal to 100 percent refreshed loan-to-value (LTV) represented five percent and six percent of the residential mortgage portfolio at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . Loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent represented five percent and seven percent of the residential mortgage loan portfolio at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . Of the loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent, 97 percent and 96 percent were performing at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . Loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent reflect loans where the outstanding carrying value of the loan is greater than the most recent valuation of the property securing the loan. The majority of these loans have a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent primarily due to home price deterioration since 2006, somewhat mitigated by subsequent appreciation. Loans to borrowers with refreshed FICO scores below 620 represented six percent and eight percent of the residential mortgage portfolio at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . Of the $136.8 billion in total residential mortgage loans outstanding at September 30, 2015 , as shown in Table 39 , 40 percent were originated as interest-only loans. The outstanding balance of interest-only residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period was $12.2 billion, or 22 percent, at September 30, 2015 . Residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period generally have experienced a higher rate of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status compared to the residential mortgage portfolio as a whole. At September 30, 2015 , $225 million, or two percent of outstanding interest-only residential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $1.7 billion , or one percent for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, at September 30, 2015 , $783 million, or six percent of outstanding interest-only residential mortgage loans that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming, of which $388 million were contractually current, compared to $5.2 billion , or four percent for the entire residential mortgage portfolio, of which $1.8 billion were contractually current. Loans in our interest-only residential mortgage portfolio have an interest-only period of three to ten years and more than 90 percent of these loans have yet to enter the amortization period and will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2016 or later. 82 Table of Contents Table 39 presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the residential mortgage portfolio. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) within California represented 13 percent of outstandings at both September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 , loans within this MSA contributed net recoveries of $6 million and $10 million within the residential mortgage portfolio. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 , loans within this MSA contributed net recoveries of $10 million and $32 million within the residential mortgage portfolio. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 11 percent of outstandings at both September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 , loans within this MSA contributed net charge-offs of $13 million and $86 million within the residential mortgage portfolio. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 , loans within this MSA contributed net charge-offs of $15 million and $44 million within the residential mortgage portfolio.

There were $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion of residential mortgage loans accounted for under the fair value option at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . For more information on the fair value option, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Consumer Loans Accounted for Under the Fair Value Option on page 91 and Note 15 Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements . (2) Net charge-offs exclude $128 million and $580 million of write-offs in the residential mortgage PCI loan portfolio for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $196 million and $547 million for the same periods in 2014 . These write-offs decreased the PCI valuation allowance included as part of the allowance for loan and lease losses. For additional information, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio on page 87 . (3) In these states, foreclosure requires a court order following a legal proceeding (judicial states). (4) Amounts exclude the PCI residential mortgage and fully-insured loan portfolios. The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) encourages banks to meet the credit needs of their communities for housing and other purposes, particularly in neighborhoods with low or moderate incomes. Our CRA portfolio was $8.2 billion and $9.0 billion at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 , or six percent and seven percent of the residential mortgage portfolio. The CRA portfolio included $641 million and $986 million of nonperforming loans at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 , representing 12 percent and 14 percent of total nonperforming residential mortgage loans. There were no net charge-offs in the CRA portfolio for the three months ended September 30, 2015 , compared to $24 million, or 45 percent of total net charge-offs for the residential mortgage portfolio for the same period in 2014 . Net charge-offs in the CRA portfolio were $71 million and $45 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 , or 18 percent and 31 percent of total net charge-offs for the residential mortgage portfolio. Home Equity At September 30, 2015 , the home equity portfolio made up 17 percent of the consumer portfolio and is comprised of home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), home equity loans and reverse mortgages. At September 30, 2015 , our HELOC portfolio had an outstanding balance of $67.7 billion, or 87 percent of the total home equity portfolio compared to $74.2 billion, or 87 percent, at December 31, 2014 . HELOCs generally have an initial draw period of 10 years and those borrowers typically are only required to pay the interest due on the loans on a monthly basis. After the initial draw period ends, the loans generally convert to 15-year amortizing loans. 83 Table of Contents At September 30, 2015 , our home equity loan portfolio had an outstanding balance of $8.4 billion , or 11 percent of the total home equity portfolio compared to $9.8 billion, or 11 percent, at December 31, 2014 . Home equity loans are almost all fixed-rate loans with amortizing payment terms of 10 to 30 years and of the $8.4 billion at September 30, 2015 , 54 percent have 25- to 30-year terms. At September 30, 2015 , our reverse mortgage portfolio had an outstanding balance, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, of $1.9 billion, or two percent of the total home equity portfolio compared to $1.7 billion, or two percent, at December 31, 2014 . We no longer originate reverse mortgages. At September 30, 2015 , approximately 56 percent of the home equity portfolio was included in Consumer Banking , 35 percent was included in LAS and the remainder of the portfolio was primarily in GWIM . Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, decreased $7.7 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to paydowns and charge-offs outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines. Of the total home equity portfolio at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 , $20.3 billion and $20.6 billion, or 26 percent and 24 percent, were in first-lien positions (28 percent and 26 percent excluding the PCI home equity portfolio). At September 30, 2015 , outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio that were in a second-lien or more junior-lien position and where we also held the first-lien loan totaled $13.4 billion, or 18 percent of our total home equity portfolio excluding the PCI loan portfolio. Unused HELOCs totaled $51.1 billion at September 30, 2015 compared to $53.7 billion at December 31, 2014 . The decrease was primarily due to customers choosing to close accounts, as well as accounts reaching the end of their draw period, which automatically eliminates open line exposure. Both of these more than offset customer paydowns of principal balances and the impact of new production. The HELOC utilization rate was 57 percent at September 30, 2015 compared to 58 percent at December 31, 2014 . Table 40 presents certain home equity portfolio key credit statistics on both a reported basis excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, and excluding the PCI loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option. Additionally, in the "Reported Basis" columns in the table below, accruing balances past due 30 days or more and nonperforming loans do not include the PCI loan portfolio, in accordance with our accounting policies, even though the customer may be contractually past due. As such, the following discussion presents the home equity portfolio excluding the PCI loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option. For more information on the PCI loan portfolio, see page 87 .

There were $225 million and $196 million of home equity loans accounted for under the fair value option at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . For more information on the fair value option, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Consumer Loans Accounted for Under the Fair Value Option on page 91 and Note 15 Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements . (2) Accruing past due 30 days or more includes $81 million and $98 million and nonperforming loans include $409 million and $505 million of loans where we serviced the underlying first-lien at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . (3) These vintages of loans have higher refreshed combined LTV ratios and accounted for 46 percent and 47 percent of nonperforming home equity loans at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 , and 52 percent and 56 percent of net charge-offs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 59 percent and 57 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 . (4) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as annualized net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option. 84 Table of Contents Nonperforming outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased $472 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as outflows, including sales of $154 million and the transfer of certain qualifying borrowers discharged in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy to performing status, outpaced new inflows. Of the nonperforming home equity portfolio at September 30, 2015 , $1.5 billion, or 43 percent, were current on contractual payments. Nonperforming loans that are contractually current primarily consist of collateral-dependent TDRs, including those that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, junior-lien loans where the underlying first-lien is 90 days or more past due, as well as loans that have not yet demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance following a TDR. In addition, $1.3 billion, or 38 percent of nonperforming home equity loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell. Accruing loans that were 30 days or more past due decreased $26 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 . In some cases, the junior-lien home equity outstanding balance that we hold is performing, but the underlying first-lien is not. For outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio on which we service the first-lien loan, we are able to track whether the first-lien loan is in default. For loans where the first-lien is serviced by a third party, we utilize credit bureau data to estimate the delinquency status of the first-lien. Given that the credit bureau database we use does not include a property address for the mortgages, we are unable to identify with certainty whether a reported delinquent first-lien mortgage pertains to the same property for which we hold a junior-lien loan. For certain loans, we utilize a third-party vendor to combine credit bureau and public record data to better link a junior-lien loan with the underlying first-lien mortgage. At September 30, 2015 , we estimate that $1.3 billion of current and $181 million of 30 to 89 days past due junior-lien loans were behind a delinquent first-lien loan. We service the first-lien loans on $215 million of these combined amounts, with the remaining $1.3 billion serviced by third parties. Of the $1.5 billion of current to 89 days past due junior-lien loans, based on available credit bureau data and our own internal servicing data, we estimate that approximately $554 million had first-lien loans that were 90 days or more past due. Net charge-offs increased $31 million to $120 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 , or 0.64 percent of the total average home equity portfolio, compared to $89 million , or 0.43 percent for the same period in 2014 . The increase for the three-month period was primarily driven by lower recoveries partially offset by continued portfolio improvement. Net charge-offs decreased $187 million to $443 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 , or 0.77 percent of the total average home equity portfolio, compared to $630 million , or 1.00 percent for the same period in 2014 . The decrease for the nine-month period was primarily driven by favorable portfolio trends due in part to improvement in home prices and the U.S. economy, partially offset by $70 million of charge-offs related to the consumer relief portion of the settlement with the DoJ and lower recoveries. The net charge-off ratios were also impacted by lower outstanding balances primarily as a result of paydowns and charge-offs outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines. Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio with greater than 90 percent but less than or equal to 100 percent refreshed combined loan-to-value (CLTV) comprised six percent and seven percent of the home equity portfolio at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . Outstanding balances with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent comprised 12 percent and 14 percent of the home equity portfolio at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent reflect loans where the carrying value and available line of credit of the combined loans are equal to or greater than the most recent valuation of the property securing the loan. Depending on the value of the property, there may be collateral in excess of the first-lien that is available to reduce the severity of loss on the second-lien. Of those outstanding balances with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent, 96 percent of the customers were current on their home equity loan and 92 percent of second-lien loans with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent were current on both their second-lien and underlying first-lien loans at September 30, 2015 . Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio to borrowers with a refreshed FICO score below 620 represented seven percent of the home equity portfolio at both September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . Of the $73.2 billion in total home equity portfolio outstandings at September 30, 2015 , as shown in Table 41 , 69 percent were interest-only loans, almost all of which were HELOCs. The outstanding balance of HELOCs that have entered the amortization period was $8.4 billion, or 13 percent of total HELOCs at September 30, 2015 . The HELOCs that have entered the amortization period have experienced a higher percentage of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status when compared to the HELOC portfolio as a whole. At September 30, 2015 , $214 million, or three percent of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $562 million, or one percent for the entire HELOC portfolio. In addition, at September 30, 2015 , $1.2 billion, or 14 percent of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming, of which $498 million were contractually current, compared to $3.1 billion, or five percent for the entire HELOC portfolio, of which $1.3 billion were contractually current. Loans in our HELOC portfolio generally have an initial draw period of 10 years and 45 percent of these loans will enter the amortization period in 2016 and 2017 and will be required to make fully-amortizing payments. We communicate to contractually current customers more than a year prior to the end of their draw period to inform them of the potential change to the payment structure before entering the amortization period, and provide payment options to customers prior to the end of the draw period. 85 Table of Contents Although we do not actively track how many of our home equity customers pay only the minimum amount due on their home equity loans and lines, we can infer some of this information through a review of our HELOC portfolio that we service and that is still in its revolving period (i.e., customers may draw on and repay their line of credit, but are generally only required to pay interest on a monthly basis). During the three months ended September 30, 2015 , approximately 52 percent of these customers with an outstanding balance did not pay any principal on their HELOCs. Table 41 presents outstandings, nonperforming balances and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the home equity portfolio. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 12 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 , loans within this MSA contributed net charge-offs of $14 million and $51 million. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 , loans within this MSA contributed net charge-offs of $16 million and $87 million. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California made up 12 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . There were no net charge-offs on loans within this MSA for the three months ended September 30, 2015 . For the nine months ended September 30, 2015 , loans within this MSA contributed net charge-offs of $14 million. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 , loans within this MSA contributed net recoveries of $10 million and net charge-offs of $21 million.

These write-offs decreased the PCI valuation allowance included as part of the allowance for loan and lease losses.

Table 42 presents the unpaid principal balance, carrying value, related valuation allowance and the net carrying value as a percentage of the unpaid principal balance for the PCI loan portfolio.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2015 , we sold PCI loans with a carrying value of $1.2 billion compared to sales of $1.9 billion for the same period in 2014. Of the unpaid principal balance of $17.8 billion at September 30, 2015 , $15.2 billion, or 86 percent, was current based on the contractual terms, $1.3 billion, or seven percent, was in early stage delinquency, and $920 million was 180 days or more past due, including $826 million of first-lien mortgages and $94 million of home equity loans. During the three months ended September 30, 2015 , we recorded a provision benefit of $68 million for the PCI loan portfolio which included an expense of $12 million for residential mortgage and a benefit of $80 million for home equity. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015 , we recorded a provision benefit of $40 million for the PCI loan portfolio which included an expense of $97 million for residential mortgage and a benefit of $137 million for home equity. This compared to no provision expense and a provision benefit of $106 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 . The provision benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily driven by lower default estimates. The PCI valuation allowance declined $766 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to write-offs in the PCI loan portfolio of $580 million in residential mortgage and $146 million in home equity, combined with a provision benefit of $40 million . 87 Table of Contents Purchased Credit-impaired Residential Mortgage Loan Portfolio The PCI residential mortgage loan portfolio represented 72 percent of the total PCI loan portfolio at September 30, 2015 . Those loans to borrowers with a refreshed FICO score below 620 represented 33 percent of the PCI residential mortgage loan portfolio at September 30, 2015 . Loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 90 percent, after consideration of purchase accounting adjustments and the related valuation allowance, represented 31 percent of the PCI residential mortgage loan portfolio and 36 percent based on the unpaid principal balance at September 30, 2015 . Table 43 presents outstandings net of purchase accounting adjustments and before the related valuation allowance, by certain state concentrations. Table 43 Outstanding Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio Residential Mortgage State Concentrations (Dollars in millions) September 30 2015 December 31 2014 California $ 5,895 $ 6,885 Florida (1) 969 1,289 Virginia 550 640 Maryland 473 602 Texas 254 318 Other U.S./Non-U.S. 4,440 5,418 Total $ 12,581 $ 15,152 (1) In this state, foreclosure requires a court order following a legal proceeding (judicial state). Pay option adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which are included in the PCI residential mortgage portfolio, have interest rates that adjust monthly and minimum required payments that adjust annually, subject to resetting if minimum payments are made and deferred interest limits are reached. Annual payment adjustments are subject to a 7.5 percent maximum change. To ensure that contractual loan payments are adequate to repay a loan, the fully-amortizing loan payment amount is re-established after the initial five- or ten-year period and again every five years thereafter. These payment adjustments are not subject to the 7.5 percent limit and may be substantial due to changes in interest rates and the addition of unpaid interest to the loan balance. The difference between the frequency of changes in a loan's interest rates and payments along with a limitation on changes in the minimum monthly payments of 7.5 percent per year can result in payments that are not sufficient to pay all of the monthly interest charges (i.e., negative amortization). Unpaid interest is added to the loan balance until the loan balance increases to a specified limit, which can be no more than 115 percent of the original loan amount, at which time a new monthly payment amount adequate to repay the loan over its remaining contractual life is established. At September 30, 2015 , the unpaid principal balance of pay option loans, which include pay option ARMs and payment advantage ARMs, was $2.5 billion, with a carrying value of $2.4 billion, including $2.1 billion of loans that were credit-impaired upon acquisition and, accordingly, the reserve is based on a life-of-loan loss estimate. The total unpaid principal balance of pay option loans with accumulated negative amortization was $560 million, including $32 million of negative amortization. For those borrowers who are making payments in accordance with their contractual terms, five percent and one percent at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 elected to make only the minimum payment on pay option loans. We believe the majority of borrowers are now making scheduled payments primarily because the low rate environment has caused the fully indexed rates to be affordable to more borrowers. We continue to evaluate our exposure to payment resets on the acquired negative-amortizing loans including the PCI pay option loan portfolio and have taken into consideration in the evaluation several assumptions including prepayment and default rates. Of the loans in the pay option portfolio at September 30, 2015 that have not already experienced a payment reset, two percent are expected to reset in 2015, 51 percent are expected to reset in 2016 and 21 percent are expected to reset thereafter. In addition, five percent are expected to prepay and approximately 21 percent are expected to default prior to being reset, most of which were severely delinquent as of September 30, 2015 . We no longer originate pay option loans. 88 Table of Contents Purchased Credit-impaired Home Equity Loan Portfolio The PCI home equity portfolio represented 28 percent of the total PCI loan portfolio at September 30, 2015 . Those loans with a refreshed FICO score below 620 represented 15 percent of the PCI home equity portfolio at September 30, 2015 . Loans with a refreshed CLTV greater than 90 percent, after consideration of purchase accounting adjustments and the related valuation allowance, represented 60 percent of the PCI home equity portfolio and 64 percent based on the unpaid principal balance at September 30, 2015 .

U.S. Credit Card At September 30, 2015 , 97 percent of the U.S. credit card portfolio was managed in Consumer Banking with the remainder managed in GWIM . Outstandings in the U.S. credit card portfolio decreased $3.5 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to a seasonal decline in retail transaction volume. Net charge-offs decreased $79 million to $546 million and $275 million to $1.8 billion during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same periods in 2014 due to improvements in delinquencies and bankruptcies as a result of an improved economic environment and the impact of higher credit quality originations. U.S. credit card loans 30 days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased $187 million while loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased $145 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as a result of the factors mentioned above that contributed to lower net charge-offs. Table 45 presents certain key credit statistics for the U.S. credit card portfolio.

Unused lines of credit for U.S. credit card totaled $317.1 billion and $305.9 billion at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . The $11.2 billion increase was driven by account growth, lines of credit increases and a seasonal decrease in line utilization due to lower transaction volumes. 89 Table of Contents Table 46 presents certain state concentrations for the U.S. credit card portfolio.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 , net charge-offs decreased $20 million to $47 million and $48 million to $142 million compared to the same periods in 2014 due to improvement in delinquencies as a result of higher credit quality originations and an improved economic environment. Unused lines of credit for non-U.S. credit card totaled $28.0 billion and $28.2 billion at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . The $223 million decrease was driven by weakening of the British Pound against the U.S. Dollar, partially offset by account growth and lines of credit increases. Table 47 presents certain key credit statistics for the non-U.S. credit card portfolio. Table 47 Non-U.S. Credit Card Key Credit Statistics (Dollars in millions) September 30 2015 December 31 2014 Outstandings $ 10,066 $ 10,465 Accruing past due 30 days or more 148 183 Accruing past due 90 days or more 78 95 Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 2015 2014 2015 2014 Net charge-offs $ 47 $ 67 $ 142 $ 190 Net charge-off ratios (1) 1.83 % 2.26 % 1.88 % 2.17 % (1) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as annualized net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans. 90 Table of Contents Direct/Indirect Consumer At September 30, 2015 , approximately 50 percent of the direct/indirect portfolio was included in GWIM (principally securities-based lending loans), 49 percent was included in Consumer Banking (consumer auto and specialty lending automotive, marine, aircraft, recreational vehicle loans, and consumer personal loans) and the remainder was primarily student loans in All Other . Outstandings in the direct/indirect portfolio increased $6.9 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as growth in the consumer auto portfolio primarily driven by bulk loan purchases, and growth in securities-based lending were partially offset by lower outstandings in the unsecured consumer lending portfolio. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 , net charge-offs decreased $9 million to $25 million and $42 million to $83 million , or 0.12 percent and 0.13 percent of total average direct/indirect loans, compared to 0.17 percent and 0.20 percent for the same periods in 2014 . These decreases in net charge-offs were primarily driven by improvements in delinquencies and bankruptcies in the unsecured consumer lending portfolio as a result of an improved economic environment as well as reduced outstandings in this portfolio. Direct/indirect loans that were past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest declined $26 million to $38 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to decreases in the unsecured consumer lending, and consumer auto and specialty lending portfolios. Table 48 presents certain state concentrations for the direct/indirect consumer loan portfolio.

The remainder is primarily associated with certain consumer finance businesses that we previously exited. Consumer Loans Accounted for Under the Fair Value Option Outstanding consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option totaled $1.9 billion at September 30, 2015 and were comprised of residential mortgage loans that were previously classified as held-for-sale, residential mortgage loans held in consolidated variable interest entities (VIEs) and repurchased home equity loans. The loans that were previously classified as held-for-sale were transferred to the residential mortgage portfolio in connection with the decision to retain the loans. The fair value option had been elected at the time of origination and the loans continue to be measured at fair value after the reclassification. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015 , we recorded net gains of $21 million resulting from changes in the fair value of these loans. 91 Table of Contents Nonperforming Consumer Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity Table 49 presents nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 . Nonperforming LHFS are excluded from nonperforming loans as they are recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value. Nonperforming loans do not include past due consumer credit card loans, other unsecured loans and in general, consumer non-real estate-secured loans (loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy are included) as these loans are typically charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due. The charge-offs on these loans have no impact on nonperforming activity and, accordingly, are excluded from this table. The fully-insured loan portfolio is not reported as nonperforming as principal repayment is insured. Additionally, nonperforming loans do not include the PCI loan portfolio or loans accounted for under the fair value option. For more information on nonperforming loans, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K . During the nine months ended September 30, 2015 , nonperforming consumer loans declined $2.1 billion to $8.7 billion and included the impact of sales of $1.4 billion, partially offset by a net increase of $176 million related to the impact of the consumer relief portion of the settlement with the DoJ for those loans that are no longer fully insured. Excluding these, nonperforming loans declined as outflows, including the transfer of certain qualifying borrowers discharged in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy to performing status, outpaced new inflows. The outstanding balance of a real estate-secured loan that is in excess of the estimated property value less costs to sell is charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due unless repayment of the loan is fully insured. At September 30, 2015 , $4.0 billion, or 44 percent of nonperforming consumer real estate loans and foreclosed properties had been written down to their estimated property value less costs to sell, including $3.6 billion of nonperforming loans 180 days or more past due and $479 million of foreclosed properties. In addition, at September 30, 2015 , $3.3 billion, or 38 percent of nonperforming consumer loans were modified and are now current after successful trial periods, or are current loans classified as nonperforming loans in accordance with applicable policies. Foreclosed properties decreased $151 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as liquidations outpaced additions. PCI loans are excluded from nonperforming loans as these loans were written down to fair value at the acquisition date; however, once the underlying real estate is acquired by the Corporation upon foreclosure of the delinquent PCI loan, it is included in foreclosed properties. PCI-related foreclosed properties increased $31 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 . Not included in foreclosed properties at September 30, 2015 was $1.3 billion of real estate that was acquired upon foreclosure of certain delinquent government-guaranteed loans (principally FHA-insured loans). We exclude these amounts from our nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties activity as we expect we will be reimbursed once the property is conveyed to the guarantor for principal and, up to certain limits, costs incurred during the foreclosure process and interest incurred during the holding period. For more information on the review of our foreclosure processes, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Servicing, Foreclosure and Other Mortgage Matters on page 54 . Restructured Loans Nonperforming loans also include certain loans that have been modified in TDRs where economic concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. These concessions typically result from the Corporation's loss mitigation activities and could include reductions in the interest rate, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance or other actions. Certain TDRs are classified as nonperforming at the time of restructuring and may only be returned to performing status after considering the borrower's sustained repayment performance for a reasonable period, generally six months. Nonperforming TDRs, excluding those modified loans in the PCI loan portfolio, are included in Table 49 . 92 Table of Contents Table 49 Nonperforming Consumer Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity (1) Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 (Dollars in millions) 2015 2014 2015 2014 Nonperforming loans and leases, beginning of period $ 9,575 $ 13,460 $ 10,819 $ 15,840 Additions to nonperforming loans and leases: New nonperforming loans and leases 1,029 1,516 3,922 5,368 Reductions to nonperforming loans and leases: Paydowns and payoffs (262 ) (522 ) (804 ) (1,315 ) Sales (447 ) (957 ) (1,360 ) (2,782 ) Returns to performing status (2) (722 ) (810 ) (2,220 ) (2,549 ) Charge-offs (375 ) (431 ) (1,319 ) (1,654 ) Transfers to foreclosed properties (3) (101 ) (183 ) (341 ) (512 ) Transfers (to) from loans held-for-sale 115 (208 ) Total net reductions to nonperforming loans and leases (878 ) (1,272 ) (2,122 ) (3,652 ) Total nonperforming loans and leases, September 30 (4) 8,697 12,188 8,697 12,188 Foreclosed properties, beginning of period 553 547 630 533 Additions to foreclosed properties: New foreclosed properties (3) 132 340 485 773 Reductions to foreclosed properties: Sales (182 ) (248 ) (552 ) (629 ) Write-downs (24 ) (25 ) (84 ) (63 ) Total net additions (reductions) to foreclosed properties (74 ) 67 (151 ) 81 Total foreclosed properties, September 30 (5) 479 614 479 614 Nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties, September 30 $ 9,176 $ 12,802 $ 9,176 $ 12,802 Nonperforming consumer loans and leases as a percentage of outstanding consumer loans and leases (6) 1.92 % 2.45 % Nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties as a percentage of outstanding consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties (6) 2.02 2.57 (1) Balances do not include nonperforming LHFS of $8 million and $9 million and nonaccruing TDRs removed from the PCI loan portfolio prior to January 1, 2010 of $49 million and $101 million at September 30, 2015 and 2014 as well as loans accruing past due 90 days or more as presented in Table 35 and Note 4 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements . (2) Consumer loans may be returned to performing status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected, or when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection. (3) New foreclosed properties represents transfers of nonperforming loans to foreclosed properties net of charge-offs taken during the first 90 days after transfer of a loan to foreclosed properties. New foreclosed properties also includes properties obtained upon foreclosure of delinquent PCI loans, properties repurchased due to representations and warranties exposure and properties acquired with newly consolidated subsidiaries. (4) At September 30, 2015 , 41 percent of nonperforming loans were 180 days or more past due. (5) Foreclosed property balances do not include properties insured by certain government-guaranteed loans, principally FHA-insured loans, of $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion at September 30, 2015 and 2014 . (6) Outstanding consumer loans and leases exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. Our policy is to record any losses in the value of foreclosed properties as a reduction in the allowance for loan and lease losses during the first 90 days after transfer of a loan to foreclosed properties. Thereafter, further losses in value as well as gains and losses on sale are recorded in noninterest expense. New foreclosed properties included in Table 49 are net of $51 million and $127 million of charge-offs and write-offs of PCI loans for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $65 million and $150 million for the same periods in 2014 , recorded during the first 90 days after transfer. We classify junior-lien home equity loans as nonperforming when the first-lien loan becomes 90 days past due even if the junior-lien loan is performing. At September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 , $554 million and $800 million of such junior-lien home equity loans were included in nonperforming loans and leases. This decline was driven by overall portfolio improvement as well as $70 million of charge-offs related to the consumer relief portion of the settlement with the DoJ. 93 Table of Contents Table 50 presents TDRs for the consumer real estate portfolio. Performing TDR balances are excluded from nonperforming loans and leases in Table 49 .

(2) Residential mortgage performing TDRs included $9.7 billion and $11.9 billion of loans that were fully-insured at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . (3) Home equity TDRs deemed collateral dependent totaled $1.6 billion and $1.6 billion , and included $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion of loans classified as nonperforming and $281 million and $178 million of loans classified as performing at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . In addition to modifying consumer real estate loans, we work with customers who are experiencing financial difficulty by modifying credit card and other consumer loans. Credit card and other consumer loan modifications generally involve a reduction in the customer's interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months, all of which are considered TDRs (the renegotiated TDR portfolio). In addition, the accounts of non-U.S. credit card customers who do not qualify for a fixed payment plan may have their interest rates reduced, as required by certain local jurisdictions. These modifications, which are also TDRs, tend to experience higher payment default rates given that the borrowers may lack the ability to repay even with the interest rate reduction. In all cases, the customer's available line of credit is canceled. Modifications of credit card and other consumer loans are primarily made through internal renegotiation programs utilizing direct customer contact, but may also utilize external renegotiation programs. The renegotiated TDR portfolio is excluded in large part from Table 49 as substantially all of the loans remain on accrual status until either charged off or paid in full. At September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 , our renegotiated TDR portfolio was $850 million and $1.1 billion , of which $692 million and $907 million were current or less than 30 days past due under the modified terms. The decline in the renegotiated TDR portfolio was primarily driven by paydowns and charge-offs as well as lower program enrollments. For more information on the renegotiated TDR portfolio, see Note 4 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements . 94 Table of Contents Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Commercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal that concentrations of credit exposure do not result in undesirable levels of risk. We review, measure and manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, customer relationship and loan size. We also review, measure and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property type. In addition, within our non-U.S. portfolio, we evaluate exposures by region and by country. Tables 55 , 60 and 65 summarize our concentrations. We also utilize syndications of exposure to third parties, loan sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio. For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status and net charge-offs for the commercial portfolio, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Commercial Credit Portfolio During the nine months ended September 30, 2015 , credit quality among large corporate borrowers remained stable. Credit quality of commercial real estate borrowers, however, improved notably as property valuations continued to increase and vacancy rates remained low. Outstanding commercial loans and leases increased $39.2 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 , primarily in U.S. commercial, non-U.S. commercial and commercial real estate. Nonperforming commercial loans and leases decreased $11 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 . Nonperforming commercial loans and leases as a percentage of outstanding loans and leases, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 0.26 percent from 0.29 percent at December 31, 2014 . Reservable criticized balances increased $2.0 billion to $13.6 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as a result of downgrades outpacing paydowns and upgrades. The increase in reservable criticized balances was primarily due to our oil, gas and energy exposure as the credit quality of certain borrowers was impacted by the sustained drop in oil prices. The allowance for loan and lease losses for the commercial portfolio increased $268 million to $4.7 billion at September 30, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014 . For additional information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 108 .

Table 53 presents commercial credit exposure by type for utilized, unfunded and total binding committed credit exposure. Commercial utilized credit exposure includes standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and financial guarantees, bankers' acceptances and commercial letters of credit for which we are legally bound to advance funds under prescribed conditions, during a specified time period. Although funds have not yet been advanced, these exposure types are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes. Total commercial utilized credit exposure increased $42.3 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily driven by growth in loans and leases. The utilization rate for loans and leases, SBLCs and financial guarantees, commercial letters of credit and bankers' acceptances, in the aggregate, was 57 percent at both September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 .

(2) Total commercial unfunded exposure includes loan commitments accounted for under the fair value option with a notional amount of $7.7 billion and $9.4 billion at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . (3) Excludes unused business card lines which are not legally binding. (4) Derivative assets are carried at fair value, reflect the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and have been reduced by cash collateral of $46.2 billion and $47.3 billion at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . Not reflected in utilized and committed exposure is additional non-cash derivative collateral held of $24.1 billion and $23.8 billion which consists primarily of other marketable securities. 96 Table of Contents Table 54 presents commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure by loan type. Criticized exposure corresponds to the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful asset categories as defined by regulatory authorities. Total commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure increased $2.0 billion , or 17 percent , during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 driven by downgrades primarily related to our oil, gas and energy exposure outpacing paydowns and upgrades. Approximately 86 percent and 87 percent of commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure was secured at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 .

(2) Percentages are calculated as commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure divided by total commercial utilized reservable exposure for each exposure category. U.S. Commercial At September 30, 2015 , 70 percent of the U.S. commercial loan portfolio, excluding small business, was managed in Global Banking, 17 percent in Global Markets , 10 percent in GWIM (generally business-purpose loans for high net worth clients) and the remainder primarily in Consumer Banking . U.S. commercial loans, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, increased $23.7 billion , or 11 percent , during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to growth across all of the commercial businesses. Nonperforming loans and leases increased $135 million , or 19 percent , during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 , largely related to our oil, gas and energy exposure. Net charge-offs decreased $6 million and $11 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same periods in 2014 . Commercial Real Estate Commercial real estate primarily includes commercial loans and leases secured by non-owner-occupied real estate and is dependent on the sale or lease of the real estate as the primary source of repayment. The portfolio remains diversified across property types and geographic regions. California represented the largest state concentration at 22 percent of the commercial real estate loans and leases portfolio at both September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . The commercial real estate portfolio is predominantly managed in Global Banking and consists of loans made primarily to public and private developers, and commercial real estate firms. Outstanding loans increased $7.9 billion , or 17 percent , during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to new originations primarily in major metropolitan markets. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 , we continued to see improvements in credit quality in both the residential and non-residential portfolios. We use a number of proactive risk mitigation initiatives to reduce adversely rated exposure in the commercial real estate portfolio including transfers of deteriorating exposures to management by independent special asset officers and the pursuit of loan restructurings or asset sales to achieve the best results for our customers and the Corporation. Nonperforming commercial real estate loans and foreclosed properties decreased $222 million and reservable criticized balances decreased $541 million , or 49 percent , during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 . The decrease in reservable criticized balances was primarily due to transfers to foreclosed properties and improvements in the remainder of the portfolio. Net recoveries were $10 million and $9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to net recoveries of $6 million and $75 million for the same periods in 2014 . 97 Table of Contents Table 55 presents outstanding commercial real estate loans by geographic region, based on the geographic location of the collateral, and by property type.

Non-residential nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties decreased $215 million to $151 million at September 30, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014 primarily due to a decrease in office property. The non-residential nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties represented 0.28 percent and 0.79 percent of total non-residential loans and foreclosed properties at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . Non-residential utilized reservable criticized exposure decreased $527 million , or 49 percent , to $553 million at September 30, 2015 compared to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2014 , which represented 1.00 percent and 2.27 percent of non-residential utilized reservable exposure. For the non-residential portfolio, net recoveries decreased $9 million to $10 million and $63 million to $10 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same periods in 2014 . At September 30, 2015 , total committed residential exposure was $3.9 billion compared to $3.6 billion at December 31, 2014 , of which $2.1 billion and $1.7 billion were funded secured loans at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . Residential nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties decreased $7 million , or 32 percent , and residential utilized reservable criticized exposure decreased $14 million , or 50 percent , during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 . The nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties and the utilized reservable criticized ratios for the residential portfolio were 0.69 percent and 0.64 percent at September 30, 2015 compared to 1.28 percent and 1.51 percent at December 31, 2014 . At September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 , the commercial real estate loan portfolio included $7.8 billion and $6.7 billion of funded construction and land development loans that were originated to fund the construction and/or rehabilitation of commercial properties. Reservable criticized construction and land development loans totaled $105 million and $164 million, and nonperforming construction and land development loans and foreclosed properties totaled $45 million and $80 million at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . During a property's construction phase, interest income is typically paid from interest reserves that are established at the inception of the loan. As construction is completed and the property is put into service, these interest reserves are depleted and interest payments from operating cash flows begin. We do not recognize interest income on nonperforming loans regardless of the existence of an interest reserve. Non-U.S. Commercial At September 30, 2015 , 75 percent of the non-U.S. commercial loan portfolio was managed in Global Banking and 25 percent in Global Markets . Outstanding loans, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, increased $8.4 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to growth in securitization finance on consumer loans and increased corporate demand. Net charge-offs were $9 million for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $1 million and $32 million for the same periods in 2014 . For more information on the non-U.S. commercial portfolio, see Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 106 . U.S. Small Business Commercial The U.S. small business commercial loan portfolio is comprised of small business card loans and small business loans managed in Consumer Banking . Credit card-related products were 45 percent and 43 percent of the U.S. small business commercial portfolio at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . Net charge-offs were $57 million and $170 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $69 million and $211 million for the same periods in 2014 , with the decrease driven by an improvement in small business card loan delinquencies and a reduction in higher risk vintages. In addition, the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was impacted by increased recoveries from the sale of previously charged-off loans in the small business loan portfolio. Of the U.S. small business commercial net charge-offs, 78 percent and 82 percent were credit card-related products for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to 75 percent and 74 percent for the same periods in 2014 . Commercial Loans Accounted for Under the Fair Value Option The portfolio of commercial loans accounted for under the fair value option is held primarily in Global Markets and Global Banking . Outstanding commercial loans accounted for under the fair value option decreased $1.4 billion to an aggregate fair value of $5.2 billion at September 30, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014 primarily due to decreased corporate borrowings under bank credit facilities. We recorded net losses of $142 million and $217 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to net losses of $9 million and net gains of $26 million for the same periods in 2014 from changes in the fair value of this loan portfolio. These amounts were primarily attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk, were recorded in other income and do not reflect the results of hedging activities. In addition, unfunded lending commitments and letters of credit accounted for under the fair value option had an aggregate fair value of $594 million and $405 million at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 , which was recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The associated aggregate notional amount of unfunded lending commitments and letters of credit accounted for under the fair value option was $7.9 billion and $9.9 billion at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . We recorded net losses of $201 million and $146 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to net gains of $6 million and $20 million for 100 Table of Contents the same periods in 2014 from changes in the fair value of commitments and letters of credit. These amounts were primarily attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk, were recorded in other income and do not reflect the results of hedging activities. Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity Table 58 presents the nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 . Nonperforming loans do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 , nonperforming commercial loans and leases decreased $70 million and $11 million to $1.1 billion . The decline in foreclosed properties of $207 million during the three months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily due to the sale of properties. Approximately 98 percent of commercial nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties were secured and approximately 66 percent were contractually current. Commercial nonperforming loans were carried at approximately 81 percent of their unpaid principal balance before consideration of the allowance for loan and lease losses as the carrying value of these loans has been reduced to the estimated property value less costs to sell.

(2) Includes U.S. small business commercial activity. Small business card loans are excluded as they are not classified as nonperforming. (3) Commercial loans and leases may be returned to performing status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected, or when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection. TDRs are generally classified as performing after a sustained period of demonstrated payment performance. (4) New foreclosed properties represents transfers of nonperforming loans to foreclosed properties net of charge-offs recorded during the first 90 days after transfer of a loan to foreclosed properties. (5) Outstanding commercial loans exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. 101 Table of Contents Table 59 presents our commercial TDRs by product type and performing status. U.S. small business commercial TDRs are comprised of renegotiated small business card loans and are not classified as nonperforming as they are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due. For more information on TDRs, see Note 4 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements .

Our commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. Total commercial committed credit exposure increased $69.7 billion , or eight percent , during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $902.1 billion . Increases in commercial committed exposure were concentrated in diversified financials, real estate, retailing, health care equipment and services, and software and services. Industry limits are used internally to manage industry concentrations and are based on committed exposures and capital usage that are allocated on an industry-by-industry basis. A risk management framework is in place to set and approve industry limits as well as to provide ongoing monitoring. Diversified financials, our largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $119.2 billion , increased $15.7 billion , or 15 percent , during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 . The increase was primarily driven by growth in exposure to asset managers and certain asset-backed lending products. Real estate, our second largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $83.0 billion , increased $6.8 billion , or nine percent , during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 . The increase was primarily due to strong demand for quality core assets in major metropolitan markets. Real estate construction and land development exposure represented 14 percent and 13 percent of the total real estate industry committed exposure at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . For more information on the commercial real estate and related portfolios, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Commercial Real Estate on page 97 . During the nine months ended September 30, 2015 committed exposure to the retailing industry increased $5.9 billion , or 10 percent , healthcare equipment and services increased $4.3 billion , or eight percent , and software and services increased $4.2 billion , or 30 percent , primarily driven by increased client activity. The significant decline in oil prices since June 2014 has impacted and may continue to impact the financial performance of energy producers as well as energy equipment and service providers. While we did not experience material credit losses in our energy portfolio through September 30, 2015 , the magnitude of the impact over time will depend upon the level of oil prices. Our oil, gas and energy related exposure decreased $1.6 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $46.1 billion , of which $21.8 billion was utilized exposure, driven by paydowns from large clients. Our committed state and municipal exposure of $40.9 billion at September 30, 2015 consisted of $34.1 billion of commercial utilized exposure (including $19.5 billion of funded loans, $6.4 billion of SBLCs and $2.3 billion of derivative assets) and $6.8 billion of unfunded commercial exposure (primarily unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit) and is reported in the government and public education industry in Table 60 . With the U.S. economy gradually strengthening, most state and local governments are experiencing improved fiscal circumstances and continue to honor debt obligations as agreed. While historical default rates have been low, as part of our overall and ongoing risk management processes, we continually monitor these exposures through a rigorous review process. Additionally, internal communications are regularly circulated such that exposure levels are maintained in compliance with established concentration guidelines. 102 Table of Contents Table 60 Commercial Credit Exposure by Industry (1) Commercial Utilized Total Commercial Committed (Dollars in millions) September 30 2015 December 31 2014 September 30 2015 December 31 2014 Diversified financials $ 75,761 $ 63,306 $ 119,248 $ 103,528 Real estate (2) 60,927 53,834 82,983 76,153 Retailing 38,080 33,683 63,931 58,043 Capital goods 31,985 29,028 58,400 54,653 Healthcare equipment and services 33,478 32,923 56,728 52,450 Banking 44,302 42,330 51,638 48,353 Government and public education 43,969 42,095 51,425 49,937 Oil, gas and energy 21,779 23,830 46,089 47,667 Materials 23,753 23,664 45,943 45,821 Consumer services 23,091 21,657 36,215 33,269 Food, beverage and tobacco 17,867 16,131 35,221 34,465 Commercial services and supplies 18,550 17,997 32,056 30,451 Transportation 18,997 17,538 27,491 24,541 Utilities 11,071 9,399 26,751 25,235 Media 12,667 11,128 23,993 21,502 Individuals and trusts 17,467 16,749 22,538 21,195 Software and services 7,566 5,927 18,287 14,071 Pharmaceuticals and biotechnology 5,448 5,707 16,715 13,493 Technology hardware and equipment 6,957 5,489 14,798 12,350 Consumer durables and apparel 5,907 6,111 10,657 10,613 Insurance, including monolines 4,587 5,204 10,611 11,252 Automobiles and components 4,108 4,114 10,492 9,683 Telecommunication services 4,373 3,814 9,953 9,295 Food and staples retailing 3,917 3,848 7,410 7,418 Religious and social organizations 4,718 4,881 6,269 6,548 Other 7,631 6,255 16,286 10,415 Total commercial credit exposure by industry $ 548,956 $ 506,642 $ 902,128 $ 832,401 Net credit default protection purchased on total commitments (3) $ (6,494 ) $ (7,302 ) (1) Includes U.S. small business commercial exposure.

For purposes of this table, the real estate industry is defined based on the borrowers' or counterparties' primary business activity using operating cash flows and primary source of repayment as key factors. (3) Represents net notional credit protection purchased. For additional information, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Risk Mitigation on page 104 . 103 Table of Contents Risk Mitigation We purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. To lower the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, we may add credit exposure within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. At September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 , net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, was $6.5 billion and $7.3 billion . We recorded net gains of $191 million and $78 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to net gains of $15 million and net losses of $87 million for the same periods in 2014 on these positions. The gains and losses on these instruments were offset by gains and losses on the related exposures. The Value-at-Risk (VaR) results for these exposures are included in the fair value option portfolio information in Table 68 . For additional information, see Trading Risk Management on page 113 . Tables 61 and 62 present the maturity profiles and the credit exposure debt ratings of the net credit default protection portfolio at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 .

(4) NR is comprised of index positions held and any names that have not been rated. In addition to our net notional credit default protection purchased to cover the funded and unfunded portion of certain credit exposures, credit derivatives are used for market-making activities for clients and establishing positions intended to profit from directional or relative value changes. We execute the majority of our credit derivative trades in the OTC market with large, multinational financial institutions, including broker-dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety of other investors. Because these transactions are executed in the OTC market, we are subject to settlement risk. We are also subject to credit risk in the event that these counterparties fail to perform under the terms of these contracts. In most cases, credit derivative transactions are executed on a daily margin basis. Therefore, events such as a credit downgrade, depending on the ultimate rating level, or a breach of credit covenants would typically require an increase in the amount of collateral required by the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow us to take additional protective measures such as early termination of all trades. 104 Table of Contents Table 63 presents the total contract/notional amount of credit derivatives outstanding and includes both purchased and written credit derivatives. The credit risk amounts are measured as net asset exposure by counterparty, taking into consideration all contracts with the counterparty. For more information on our written credit derivatives, see Note 2 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . The credit risk amounts discussed above and presented in Table 63 take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements while amounts disclosed in Note 2 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements are shown on a gross basis. Credit risk reflects the potential benefit from offsetting exposure to non-credit derivative products with the same counterparties that may be netted upon the occurrence of certain events, thereby reducing our overall exposure.

We calculate CVA based on a modeled expected exposure that incorporates current market risk factors including changes in market spreads and non-credit related market factors that affect the value of a derivative. The exposure also takes into consideration credit mitigants such as legally enforceable master netting agreements and collateral. For additional information, see Note 2 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . We enter into risk management activities to offset market driven exposures. We often hedge the counterparty spread risk in CVA with credit default swaps (CDS). We hedge other market risks in CVA primarily with currency and interest rate swaps. In certain instances, the net-of-hedge amounts in the table below move in the same direction as the gross amount or may move in the opposite direction. This is a consequence of the complex interaction of the risks being hedged resulting in limitations in the ability to perfectly hedge all of the market exposures at all times. Table 64 Credit Valuation Gains and Losses Gains (Losses) Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 2015 2014 2015 2014 (Dollars in millions) Gross Hedge Net Gross Hedge Net Gross Hedge Net Gross Hedge Net Credit valuation $ (137 ) $ 204 $ 67 $ (139 ) $ 190 $ 51 $ 85 $ 89 $ 174 $ 179 $ 73 $ 252 105 Table of Contents Non-U.S. Portfolio Our non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios are subject to country risk. We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in government policies. A risk management framework is in place to measure, monitor and manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. In addition to the direct risk of doing business in a country, we also are exposed to indirect country risks (e.g., related to the collateral received on secured financing transactions or related to client clearing activities). These indirect exposures are managed in the normal course of business through credit, market and operational risk governance, rather than through country risk governance. Table 65 presents our 20 largest non-U.S. country exposures at September 30, 2015 . These exposures accounted for 87 percent and 88 percent of our total non-U.S. exposure at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . Net country exposure for these 20 countries increased $11.1 billion from December 31, 2014 primarily driven by increases in the United Kingdom, Israel, South Korea, Hong Kong and India, partially offset by reductions in Japan, China and Switzerland. On a product basis, the increase was driven by higher funded loans and loan equivalents in the United Kingdom, India, Hong Kong, Germany and South Korea; higher unfunded commitments in Israel, United Kingdom and Australia; and higher derivatives exposure in the United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates and South Korea. These increases were partially offset by reductions in securities in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and Italy; lower derivatives exposure in Italy and Switzerland; and a reduction in unfunded commitments in France, Switzerland, Germany and Spain. Non-U.S. exposure is presented on an internal risk management basis and includes sovereign and non-sovereign credit exposure, securities and other investments issued by or domiciled in countries other than the U.S. The risk assignments by country can be adjusted for external guarantees and certain collateral types. Exposures that are subject to external guarantees are reported under the country of the guarantor. Exposures with tangible collateral are reflected in the country where the collateral is held. For securities received, other than cross-border resale agreements, outstandings are assigned to the domicile of the issuer of the securities. Funded loans and loan equivalents include loans, leases, and other extensions of credit and funds, including letters of credit and due from placements, which have not been reduced by collateral, hedges or credit default protection. Funded loans and loan equivalents are reported net of charge-offs but prior to any allowance for loan and lease losses. Unfunded commitments are the undrawn portion of legally binding commitments related to loans and loan equivalents. Net counterparty exposure includes the fair value of derivatives, including the counterparty risk associated with CDS, and secured financing transactions. Derivatives exposures are presented net of collateral, which is predominantly cash, pledged under legally enforceable master netting agreements. Secured financing transaction exposures are presented net of eligible cash or securities pledged as collateral. Securities and other investments are carried at fair value and long securities exposures are netted against short exposures with the same underlying issuer to, but not below, zero (i.e., negative issuer exposures are reported as zero ). Other investments include our GPI portfolio and strategic investments. Net country exposure represents country exposure less hedges and credit default protection purchased, net of credit default protection sold. We hedge certain of our country exposures with credit default protection primarily in the form of single-name, as well as indexed and tranched CDS. The exposures associated with these hedges represent the amount that would be realized upon the isolated default of an individual issuer in the relevant country assuming a zero recovery rate for that individual issuer, and are calculated based on the CDS notional amount adjusted for any fair value receivable or payable. Changes in the assumption of an isolated default can produce different results in a particular tranche. 106 Table of Contents Table 65 Top 20 Non-U.S. Countries Exposure (Dollars in millions) Funded Loans and Loan Equivalents Unfunded Loan Commitments Net Counterparty Exposure Securities/ Other Investments Country Exposure at September 30 2015 Hedges and Credit Default Protection Net Country Exposure at September 30 2015 Increase (Decrease) from December 31 2014 United Kingdom $ 28,155 $ 13,745 $ 8,315 $ 5,498 $ 55,713 $ (4,159 ) $ 51,554 $ 6,007 Canada 6,268 6,674 2,080 4,344 19,366 (1,136 ) 18,230 (310 ) Brazil 10,147 384 859 4,026 15,416 (253 ) 15,163 179 Japan 12,428 538 4,046 1,067 18,079 (3,099 ) 14,980 (1,754 ) Germany 6,065 5,406 3,297 2,342 17,110 (4,546 ) 12,564 5 India 7,534 279 369 3,725 11,907 (274 ) 11,633 1,047 China 9,875 625 679 1,311 12,490 (1,139 ) 11,351 (941 ) France 2,819 4,580 1,493 5,429 14,321 (3,621 ) 10,700 262 Hong Kong 7,469 295 1,391 656 9,811 (26 ) 9,785 1,177 Netherlands 3,007 3,028 864 2,465 9,364 (1,204 ) 8,160 25 Australia 3,256 2,868 780 1,559 8,463 (441 ) 8,022 349 South Korea 4,134 991 1,009 2,225 8,359 (642 ) 7,717 1,268 Switzerland 2,876 3,168 454 680 7,178 (1,343 ) 5,835 (696 ) Italy 2,714 1,486 1,627 1,249 7,076 (1,888 ) 5,188 (211 ) Mexico 2,913 1,051 221 544 4,729 (316 ) 4,413 142 Singapore 2,274 79 700 1,223 4,276 (54 ) 4,222 218 Israel (1) 236 3,375 15 185 3,811 (20 ) 3,791 3,313 Spain 2,098 581 281 1,029 3,989 (587 ) 3,402 (214 ) Turkey 3,152 75 42 50 3,319 (131 ) 3,188 700 United Arab Emirates 1,865 107 1,094 34 3,100 (110 ) 2,990 583 Total top 20 non-U.S. countries exposure $ 119,285 $ 49,335 $ 29,616 $ 39,641 $ 237,877 $ (24,989 ) $ 212,888 $ 11,149 (1) The increase in exposure to unfunded loan commitments from December 31, 2014 was primarily due to an outstanding bridge loan agreement. Our net exposure to Greece at September 30, 2015 was $264 million, primarily in the form of sovereign derivatives. Implementation risks surrounding the release of new bailout funds to Greece, conditional on reforms, remain high and the additional austerity also required will have a negative impact on the Greek economy in the short term. We are closely monitoring the financial crisis in Greece through established routines and crisis control processes, and do not currently anticipate a material adverse impact to our portfolio or widespread contagion from a potential Greek default or eurozone exit. Russian intervention in Ukraine initiated in 2014 significantly increased regional geopolitical tensions. The Russian economy continues to slow due to the negative impacts of weak oil prices, ongoing economic sanctions and high interest rates resulting from Russian central bank actions taken to counter ruble depreciation. At September 30, 2015 , our net exposure to Russia remained relatively unchanged from June 30, 2015 at $2.9 billion , concentrated in oil and gas companies and commercial banks. Our exposure to Ukraine was minimal. In response to Russian actions, U.S. and European governments have imposed sanctions on a limited number of Russian individuals and business entities. Geopolitical and economic conditions remain fluid with potential for further escalation of tensions, increased severity of sanctions against Russian interests, sustained low oil prices and rating agency downgrades. Certain European countries, including Italy, Spain, Ireland and Portugal, have experienced varying degrees of financial stress in recent years. While market conditions have improved in Europe, policymakers continue to address fundamental challenges of competitiveness, growth, deflation and high unemployment. A return of political stress or financial instability in these countries could disrupt financial markets and have a detrimental impact on global economic conditions and sovereign and non-sovereign debt in these countries. Our net exposure at September 30, 2015 to Italy and Spain was $5.2 billion and $3.4 billion , respectively, as presented in Table 65 . Net exposure at September 30, 2015 to Ireland and Portugal was $880 million and $124 million, respectively. We expect to continue to support client activities in the region and our exposures may vary over time as we monitor the situation and manage our risk profile. Weakening of commodity prices, signs of slowing growth in China and a recession in Brazil is driving risk aversion in emerging markets. At September 30, 2015 , our net exposure to China remained relatively unchanged from June 30, 2015 at $11.4 billion, concentrated in large state-owned companies, subsidiaries of multinational corporations and commercial banks. Our exposure to Brazil was $15.2 billion, concentrated in sovereign securities, oil and gas companies and commercial banks. 107 Table of Contents Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses increased $170 million to $806 million , and $295 million to $2.4 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same periods in 2014 . The provision for credit losses was $126 million and $843 million lower than net charge-offs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 , resulting in a reduction in the allowance for credit losses. This compared to a reduction of $407 million and $1.4 billion in the allowance for credit losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 . We currently expect that, if economic conditions remain unchanged, the provision for credit losses would be generally consistent with present levels through mid-2016. The provision for credit losses for the consumer portfolio decreased $2 million to $542 million , and increased $363 million to $1.7 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same periods in 2014 . The prior-year periods included $400 million of additional costs associated with the consumer relief portion of the settlement with the DoJ. Excluding these additional costs, the consumer provision for credit losses increased as we continue to release reserves, but at a slower pace than in the prior-year periods, and also due to a lower level of recoveries on nonperforming loan sales and other recoveries in the nine-month period. Included in the provision is a benefit of $68 million and $40 million related to the PCI loan portfolio for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 . This compared to no provision for the three months ended September 30, 2014 and a benefit of $106 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 . The provision for credit losses for the commercial portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, increased $172 million to $264 million , primarily due to loan growth, and decreased $68 million to $637 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same periods in 2014 . Allowance for Credit Losses Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses The allowance for loan and lease losses is comprised of two components. The first component covers nonperforming commercial loans and TDRs. The second component covers loans and leases on which there are incurred losses that are not yet individually identifiable, as well as incurred losses that may not be represented in the loss forecast models. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses based on the total of these two components, each of which is described in more detail below. The allowance for loan and lease losses excludes LHFS and loans accounted for under the fair value option as the fair value reflects a credit risk component. The first component of the allowance for loan and lease losses covers both nonperforming commercial loans and all TDRs within the consumer and commercial portfolios. These loans are subject to impairment measurement based on the present value of projected future cash flows discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate, or in certain circumstances, impairment may also be based upon the collateral value or the loan's observable market price if available. Impairment measurement for the renegotiated consumer credit card, small business credit card and unsecured consumer TDR portfolios is based on the present value of projected cash flows discounted using the average portfolio contractual interest rate, excluding promotionally priced loans, in effect prior to restructuring. For purposes of computing this specific loss component of the allowance, larger impaired loans are evaluated individually and smaller impaired loans are evaluated as a pool using historical experience for the respective product types and risk ratings of the loans. The second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses covers the remaining consumer and commercial loans and leases that have incurred losses that are not yet individually identifiable. The allowance for consumer and certain homogeneous commercial loan and lease products is based on aggregated portfolio evaluations, generally by product type. Loss forecast models are utilized that consider a variety of factors including, but not limited to, historical loss experience, estimated defaults or foreclosures based on portfolio trends, delinquencies, economic trends and credit scores. Our consumer real estate loss forecast model estimates the portion of loans that will default based on individual loan attributes, the most significant of which are refreshed LTV or CLTV, and borrower credit score as well as vintage and geography, all of which are further broken down into current delinquency status. Additionally, we incorporate the delinquency status of underlying first-lien loans on our junior-lien home equity portfolio in our allowance process. Incorporating refreshed LTV and CLTV into our probability of default allows us to factor the impact of changes in home prices into our allowance for loan and lease losses. These loss forecast models are updated on a quarterly basis to incorporate information reflecting the current economic environment. As of September 30, 2015 , the loss forecast process resulted in reductions in the allowance for all major consumer portfolios compared to December 31, 2014 . The allowance for commercial loan and lease losses is established by product type after analyzing historical loss experience, internal risk rating, current economic conditions, industry performance trends, geographic and obligor concentrations within each portfolio and any other pertinent information. The statistical models for commercial loans are generally updated annually and utilize our historical database of actual defaults and other data. The loan risk ratings and composition of the commercial portfolios used to calculate the 108 Table of Contents allowance are updated quarterly to incorporate the most recent data reflecting the current economic environment. For risk-rated commercial loans, we estimate the probability of default and the LGD based on our historical experience of defaults and credit losses. Factors considered when assessing the internal risk rating include the value of the underlying collateral, if applicable, the industry in which the obligor operates, the obligor's liquidity and other financial indicators, and other quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to the obligor's credit risk. As of September 30, 2015 , the allowance increased for all major commercial portfolios compared to December 31, 2014 . Also included within the second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses are reserves to cover losses that are incurred but, in our assessment, may not be adequately represented in the historical loss data used in the loss forecast models. For example, factors that we consider include, among others, changes in lending policies and procedures, changes in economic and business conditions, changes in the nature and size of the portfolio, changes in portfolio concentrations, changes in the volume and severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such as competition, and legal and regulatory requirements. We also consider factors that are applicable to unique portfolio segments. For example, we consider the risk of uncertainty in our loss forecasting models related to junior-lien home equity loans that are current, but have first-lien loans that we do not service that are 30 days or more past due. In addition, we consider the increased risk of default associated with our interest-only loans that have yet to enter the amortization period. Further, we consider the inherent uncertainty in mathematical models that are built upon historical data. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 , the factors that impacted the allowance for loan and lease losses included overall improvements in the credit quality of the portfolios driven by continuing improvements in the U.S. economy and labor markets, continuing proactive credit risk management initiatives and the impact of recent higher credit quality originations. Additionally, the resolution of uncertainties through current recognition of net charge-offs has impacted the amount of reserve needed in certain portfolios. Evidencing the improvements in the U.S. economy and labor markets are modest growth in consumer spending, improvements in unemployment levels and a decrease in the absolute level and our share of national consumer bankruptcy filings. In addition to these improvements, returns to performing status, charge-offs, sales, paydowns and transfers to foreclosed properties continued to outpace new nonaccrual loans. Also impacting the allowance for loan and lease losses was growth in loan balances across the commercial portfolio. We monitor differences between estimated and actual incurred loan and lease losses. This monitoring process includes periodic assessments by senior management of loan and lease portfolios and the models used to estimate incurred losses in those portfolios. Additions to, or reductions of, the allowance for loan and lease losses generally are recorded through charges or credits to the provision for credit losses. Credit exposures deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan and lease losses. Recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan and lease losses. The allowance for loan and lease losses for the consumer portfolio, as presented in Table 67 , was $8.0 billion at September 30, 2015 , a decrease of $2.0 billion from December 31, 2014 . The decrease was primarily in the residential mortgage, home equity and credit card portfolios. Reductions in the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios were due to improved home prices and lower delinquencies, a decrease in consumer loan balances, as well as the utilization of reserves recorded as a part of the settlement with the DoJ. Further, the residential mortgage and home equity allowance declined due to write-offs in our PCI loan portfolio. The decrease in the allowance related to the U.S. credit card and unsecured consumer lending portfolios in Consumer Banking was primarily due to improvement in delinquencies and more generally in unemployment levels. For example, in the U.S. credit card portfolio, accruing loans 30 days or more past due decreased to $1.5 billion at September 30, 2015 from $1.7 billion (to 1.71 percent from 1.85 percent of outstanding U.S. credit card loans) at December 31, 2014 , and accruing loans 90 days or more past due decreased to $721 million at September 30, 2015 from $866 million (to 0.82 percent from 0.94 percent of outstanding U.S. credit card loans) at December 31, 2014 . See Tables 35 , 36 , 45 and 47 for additional details on key credit statistics for the credit card and other unsecured consumer lending portfolios. The allowance for loan and lease losses for the commercial portfolio, as presented in Table 67 , was $4.7 billion at September 30, 2015 , an increase of $268 million from December 31, 2014 with the increase attributable in part to loan growth. Commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure increased to $13.6 billion at September 30, 2015 from $11.6 billion (to 2.94 percent from 2.74 percent of total commercial utilized reservable exposure) at December 31, 2014 , primarily due to certain downgrades in the oil and gas portfolio. Nonperforming commercial loans remained unchanged at $1.1 billion between September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . The percentage of commercial nonperforming loans to total outstanding commercial loans decreased to 0.26 percent from 0.29 percent due to an increase in loan balances during the year. Commercial loans and leases outstanding increased to $432.0 billion at September 30, 2015 from $392.8 billion at December 31, 2014 . See Tables 51 , 52 and 54 for additional details on key commercial credit statistics. The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding was 1.44 percent at September 30, 2015 compared to 1.65 percent at December 31, 2014 . The decrease in the ratio was primarily due to improved credit quality driven by improved economic conditions, write-offs in the PCI loan portfolio and utilization of reserves related to the settlement with the DoJ. The September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 ratios above include the PCI loan portfolio. Excluding the PCI loan portfolio, the allowance 109 Table of Contents for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding was 1.36 percent at September 30, 2015 compared to 1.50 percent at December 31, 2014 . Table 66 presents a rollforward of the allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 .

However, the allowance is generally available to absorb any credit losses without restriction. Table 67 presents our allocation by product type. Table 67 Allocation of the Allowance for Credit Losses by Product Type September 30, 2015 December 31, 2014 (Dollars in millions) Amount Percent of Total Percent of Loans and Leases Outstanding (1) Amount Percent of Total Percent of Loans and Leases Outstanding (1) Allowance for loan and lease losses Residential mortgage $ 1,755 13.87 % 0.93 % $ 2,900 20.11 % 1.34 % Home equity 2,645 20.90 3.39 3,035 21.05 3.54 U.S. credit card 2,973 23.49 3.37 3,320 23.03 3.61 Non-U.S. credit card 299 2.36 2.97 369 2.56 3.53 Direct/Indirect consumer 234 1.85 0.27 299 2.07 0.37 Other consumer 46 0.36 2.33 59 0.41 3.15 Total consumer 7,952 62.83 1.75 9,982 69.23 2.05 U.S. commercial (2) 2,749 21.72 1.07 2,619 18.16 1.12 Commercial real estate 1,084 8.56 1.95 1,016 7.05 2.13 Commercial lease financing 160 1.26 0.62 153 1.06 0.62 Non-U.S. commercial 712 5.63 0.80 649 4.50 0.81 Total commercial (3) 4,705 37.17 1.10 4,437 30.77 1.15 Allowance for loan and lease losses (4) 12,657 100.00 % 1.44 14,419 100.00 % 1.65 Reserve for unfunded lending commitments 661 528 Allowance for credit losses $ 13,318 $ 14,947 (1) Ratios are calculated as allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loans and leases outstanding excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option. Consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option included residential mortgage loans of $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion and home equity loans of $225 million and $196 million at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . Commercial loans accounted for under the fair value option included U.S. commercial loans of $2.2 billion and $1.9 billion and non-U.S. commercial loans of $3.0 billion and $4.7 billion at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . (2) Includes allowance for loan and lease losses for U.S. small business commercial loans of $520 million and $536 million at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . (3) Includes allowance for loan and lease losses for impaired commercial loans of $154 million and $159 million at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . (4) Includes $886 million and $1.7 billion of valuation allowance presented with the allowance for loan and lease losses related to PCI loans at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we also estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments such as letters of credit, financial guarantees, unfunded bankers' acceptances and binding loan commitments, excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value option. Unfunded lending commitments are subject to the same assessment as funded loans, including estimates of probability of default and LGD. Due to the nature of unfunded commitments, the estimate of probable losses must also consider utilization. To estimate the portion of these undrawn commitments that is likely to be drawn by a borrower at the time of estimated default, analyses of the Corporation's historical experience are applied to the unfunded commitments to estimate the funded EAD. The expected loss for unfunded lending commitments is the product of the probability of default, the LGD and the EAD, adjusted for any qualitative factors including economic uncertainty and inherent imprecision in models. The reserve for unfunded lending commitments was $661 million at September 30, 2015 , an increase of $133 million from December 31, 2014 with the increase attributable to higher unfunded balances and updates to unfunded loss models. 112 Table of Contents Market Risk Management Market risk is the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions. This risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations, primarily within our Global Markets segment. We are also exposed to these risks in other areas of the Corporation (e.g., our ALM activities). In the event of market stress, these risks could have a material impact on the results of the Corporation. For additional information, see Interest Rate Risk Management for Non-trading Activities on page 118 . Our traditional banking loan and deposit products are non-trading positions and are generally reported at amortized cost for assets or the amount owed for liabilities (historical cost). However, these positions are still subject to changes in economic value based on varying market conditions, with one of the primary risks being changes in the levels of interest rates. The risk of adverse changes in the economic value of our non-trading positions arising from changes in interest rates is managed through our ALM activities. We have elected to account for certain assets and liabilities under the fair value option. Our trading positions are reported at fair value with changes reflected in income. Trading positions are subject to various changes in market-based risk factors. The majority of this risk is generated by our activities in the interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, equity and commodities markets. In addition, the values of assets and liabilities could change due to market liquidity, correlations across markets and expectations of market volatility. We seek to manage these risk exposures by using a variety of techniques that encompass a broad range of financial instruments. The key risk management techniques are discussed in more detail in the Trading Risk Management section. Global Markets Risk Management is responsible for providing senior management with a clear and comprehensive understanding of the trading risks to which the Corporation is exposed. These responsibilities include ownership of market risk policy, developing and maintaining quantitative risk models, calculating aggregated risk measures, establishing and monitoring position limits consistent with risk appetite, conducting daily reviews and analysis of trading inventory, approving material risk exposures and fulfilling regulatory requirements. Market risks that impact businesses outside of Global Markets are monitored and governed by their respective governance functions. Quantitative risk models, such as VaR, are an essential component in evaluating the market risks within a portfolio. A subcommittee of the Management Risk Committee (MRC) is responsible for providing management oversight and approval of model risk management and governance (Risk Management, or RM subcommittee). The RM subcommittee defines model risk standards, consistent with the Corporation's risk framework and risk appetite, prevailing regulatory guidance and industry best practice. Models must meet certain validation criteria, including effective challenge of the model development process and a sufficient demonstration of developmental evidence incorporating a comparison of alternative theories and approaches. The RM subcommittee ensures model standards are consistent with model risk requirements and monitors the effective challenge in the model validation process across the Corporation. In addition, the relevant stakeholders must agree on any required actions or restrictions to the models and maintain a stringent monitoring process to ensure continued compliance. For more information on the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities, see Note 14 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements . For more information on our market risk management process, see page 99 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Trading Risk Management To evaluate risk in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of revenues generated by individual positions as well as portfolios of positions. Various techniques and procedures are utilized to enable the most complete understanding of these risks. Quantitative measures of market risk are evaluated on a daily basis from a single position to the portfolio of the Corporation. These measures include sensitivities of positions to various market risk factors, such as the potential impact on revenue from a one basis point change in interest rates, and statistical measures utilizing both actual and hypothetical market moves, such as Value-at-Risk (VaR) and stress testing. Periods of extreme market stress influence the reliability of these techniques to varying degrees. Qualitative evaluations of market risk utilize the suite of quantitative risk measures while understanding each of their respective limitations. Additionally, risk managers independently evaluate the risk of the portfolios under the current market environment and potential future environments. 113 Table of Contents VaR is a common statistic used to measure market risk as it allows the aggregation of market risk factors, including the effects of portfolio diversification. A VaR model simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR represents the loss a portfolio is not expected to exceed more than a certain number of times per period, based on a specified holding period, confidence level and window of historical data. We use one VaR model consistently across the trading portfolios and it uses a historical simulation approach based on a three-year window of historical data. Our primary VaR statistic is equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level. This means that for a VaR with a one-day holding period, there should not be losses in excess of VaR, on average, 99 out of 100 trading days. Within any VaR model, there are significant and numerous assumptions that will differ from company to company. The accuracy of a VaR model depends on the availability and quality of historical data for each of the risk factors in the portfolio. A VaR model may require additional modeling assumptions for new products that do not have the necessary historical market data or for less liquid positions for which accurate daily prices are not consistently available. For positions with insufficient historical data for the VaR calculation, the process for establishing an appropriate proxy is based on fundamental and statistical analysis of the new product or less liquid position. This analysis identifies reasonable alternatives that replicate both the expected volatility and correlation to other market risk factors that the missing data would be expected to experience. VaR may not be indicative of realized revenue volatility as changes in market conditions or in the composition of the portfolio can have a material impact on the results. In particular, the historical data used for the VaR calculation might indicate higher or lower levels of portfolio diversification than will be experienced. In order for the VaR model to reflect current market conditions, we update the historical data underlying our VaR model on a weekly basis, or more frequently during periods of market stress, and regularly review the assumptions underlying the model. A relatively minor portion of risks related to our trading positions is not included in VaR. These risks are reviewed as part of our ICAAP. Global Markets Risk Management continually reviews, evaluates and enhances our VaR model so that it reflects the material risks in our trading portfolio. Changes to the VaR model are reviewed and approved prior to implementation and any material changes are reported to management through the appropriate management committees. Trading limits on quantitative risk measures, including VaR, are independently set by Global Markets Risk Management and reviewed on a regular basis to ensure they remain relevant and within our overall risk appetite for market risks. Trading limits are reviewed in the context of market liquidity, volatility and strategic business priorities. Trading limits are set at both a granular level to ensure extensive coverage of risks as well as at aggregated portfolios to account for correlations among risk factors. All trading limits are approved at least annually. Approved trading limits are stored and tracked in a centralized limits management system. Trading limit excesses are communicated to management for review. Certain quantitative market risk measures and corresponding limits have been identified as critical in the Corporation's Risk Appetite Statement. These risk appetite limits are reported on a daily basis and are approved at least annually by the ERC and the Board. In periods of market stress, Global Markets senior leadership communicates daily to discuss losses, key risk positions and any limit excesses. As a result of this process, the businesses may selectively reduce risk. Table 68 presents the total market-based trading portfolio VaR which is the combination of the covered positions trading portfolio and the impact from less liquid trading exposures. Covered positions are defined by regulatory standards as trading assets and liabilities, both on- and off-balance sheet, that meet a defined set of specifications. These specifications identify the most liquid trading positions which are intended to be held for a short-term horizon and where the Corporation is able to hedge the material risk elements in a two-way market. Positions in less liquid markets, or where there are restrictions on the ability to trade the positions, typically do not qualify as covered positions. Foreign exchange and commodity positions are always considered covered positions, except for structural foreign currency positions that we choose to exclude with prior regulatory approval. In addition, Table 68 presents our fair value option portfolio, which includes the funded and unfunded exposures for which we elect the fair value option and their corresponding hedges. The fair value option portfolio combined with the total market-based trading portfolio VaR represents the Corporation's total market-based portfolio VaR. Additionally, market risk VaR for trading activities as presented in Table 68 differs from VaR used for regulatory capital calculations due to the holding period used. The holding period for VaR used for regulatory capital calculations is 10 days, while for the market risk VaR presented below it is one day. Both measures utilize the same process and methodology. The total market-based portfolio VaR results in Table 68 include market risk from all business segments to which the Corporation is exposed, excluding CVA and DVA. The majority of this portfolio is within the Global Markets segment. 114 Table of Contents Table 68 presents period-end, average, high and low daily trading VaR for the three months ended September 30, 2015 , June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014 , as well as average daily trading VaR for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 , using a 99 percent confidence level.

Therefore the impact from less liquid exposures and the amount of portfolio diversification, which is the difference between the total portfolio and the sum of the individual components, are not relevant. The average total market-based trading portfolio VaR decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015 primarily due to reduced exposure to the credit and interest rate markets. The graph below presents the daily total market-based trading portfolio VaR for the previous five quarters, corresponding to the data in Table 68 . 115 Table of Contents Additional VaR statistics produced within the Corporation's single VaR model are provided in Table 69 at the same level of detail as in Table 68 . Evaluating VaR with additional statistics allows for an increased understanding of the risks in the portfolio as the historical market data used in the VaR calculation does not necessarily follow a predefined statistical distribution. Table 69 presents average trading VaR statistics for 99 percent and 95 percent confidence levels for the three months ended September 30, 2015 , June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014 .

A backtesting excess occurs when a trading loss exceeds the VaR for the corresponding day. These excesses are evaluated to understand the positions and market moves that produced the trading loss and to ensure that the VaR methodology accurately represents those losses. As our primary VaR statistic used for backtesting is based on a 99 percent confidence level and a one-day holding period, we expect one trading loss in excess of VaR every 100 days, or between two to three trading losses in excess of VaR over the course of a year. The number of backtesting excesses observed can differ from the statistically expected number of excesses if the current level of market volatility is materially different than the level of market volatility that existed during the three years of historical data used in the VaR calculation. We conduct daily backtesting on our portfolios, ranging from the total market-based portfolio to individual trading areas. Additionally, we conduct daily backtesting on the VaR results used for regulatory capital calculations as well as the VaR results for key legal entities, regions and risk factors. These results are reported to senior market risk management. Senior management regularly reviews and evaluates the results of these tests. The trading revenue used for backtesting is defined by regulatory agencies in order to most closely align with the VaR component of the regulatory capital calculation. This revenue differs from total trading-related revenue in that it excludes revenue from trading activities that either do not generate market risk or the market risk cannot be included in VaR. Some examples of the types of revenue excluded for backtesting are fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income and intraday trading revenues. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 , there were no days in which there was a backtesting excess for our total market-based portfolio VaR, utilizing a one-day holding period. 116 Table of Contents Total Trading-related Revenue Total trading-related revenue, excluding brokerage fees, and CVA and DVA related revenue, represents the total amount earned from trading positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. Trading account assets and liabilities are reported at fair value. For more information on fair value, see Note 14 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Trading-related revenues can be volatile and are largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand. Also, trading-related revenues are dependent on the volume and type of transactions, the level of risk assumed, and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the ever-changing market environment. Significant daily revenues by business are monitored and the primary drivers of these are reviewed. The histogram below is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015 and March 31, 2015 . During the three months ended September 30, 2015 , positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 100 percent of the trading days, of which 74 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million. This compares to the three months ended June 30, 2015 , where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 98 percent of the trading days, of which 78 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million and the largest loss was $4 million. During the three months ended March 31, 2015 , positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 97 percent of the trading days, of which 86 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million and the largest loss was $3 million. 117 Table of Contents Trading Portfolio Stress Testing Because the very nature of a VaR model suggests results can exceed our estimates and it is dependent on a limited historical window, we also stress test our portfolio using scenario analysis. This analysis estimates the change in value of our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements. A set of scenarios, categorized as either historical or hypothetical, are computed daily for the overall trading portfolio and individual businesses. These scenarios include shocks to underlying market risk factors that may be well beyond the shocks found in the historical data used to calculate VaR. Historical scenarios simulate the impact of the market moves that occurred during a period of extended historical market stress. Generally, a multi-week period representing the most severe point during a crisis is selected for each historical scenario. Hypothetical scenarios provide simulations of the estimated portfolio impact from potential future market stress events. Scenarios are reviewed and updated in response to changing positions and new economic or political information. In addition, new or ad hoc scenarios are developed to address specific potential market events or particular vulnerabilities in the portfolio. The stress tests are reviewed on a regular basis and the results are presented to senior management. Stress testing for the trading portfolio is integrated with enterprise-wide stress testing and incorporated into the limits framework. The macroeconomic scenarios used for enterprise-wide stress testing purposes differ from the typical trading portfolio scenarios in that they have a longer time horizon and the results are forecasted over multiple periods for use in consolidated capital and liquidity planning. For additional information, see Managing Risk on page 55 . Interest Rate Risk Management for Non-trading Activities The following discussion presents net interest income excluding the impact of trading-related activities. Interest rate risk represents the most significant market risk exposure to our non-trading balance sheet. Interest rate risk is measured as the potential change in net interest income caused by movements in market interest rates. Client-facing activities, primarily lending and deposit-taking, create interest rate sensitive positions on our balance sheet. We prepare forward-looking forecasts of net interest income. The baseline forecast takes into consideration expected future business growth, ALM positioning and the direction of interest rate movements as implied by the market-based forward curve. We then measure and evaluate the impact that alternative interest rate scenarios have on the baseline forecast in order to assess interest rate sensitivity under varied conditions. The net interest income forecast is frequently updated for changing assumptions and differing outlooks based on economic trends, market conditions and business strategies. Thus, we continually monitor our balance sheet position in order to maintain an acceptable level of exposure to interest rate changes. The interest rate scenarios that we analyze incorporate balance sheet assumptions such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, changes in funding mix, product repricing and maturity characteristics. Our overall goal is to manage interest rate risk so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital. Table 70 presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . Table 70 Forward Rates September 30, 2015 December 31, 2014 Federal Funds Three-month LIBOR 10-Year Swap Federal Funds Three-month LIBOR 10-Year Swap Spot rates 0.25 % 0.33 % 2.00 % 0.25 % 0.26 % 2.28 % 12-month forward rates 0.50 0.77 2.25 0.75 0.91 2.55 Table 71 shows the pretax dollar impact to forecasted net interest income over the next 12 months from September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 , resulting from instantaneous parallel and non-parallel shocks to the market-based forward curve. Periodically we evaluate the scenarios presented to ensure that they are meaningful in the context of the current rate environment. For more information on net interest income excluding the impact of trading-related activities, see page 19 . 118 Table of Contents For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 , the asset sensitivity to long-end rates on our balance sheet increased due to lower interest rates. We continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel move in interest rates with the majority of that benefit coming from the short end of the yield curve. Additionally, higher interest rates impact the fair value of debt securities and, accordingly, for debt securities classified as AFS, may adversely affect accumulated OCI and thus capital levels under the Basel 3 capital rules. Under instantaneous upward parallel shifts, the near term adverse impact to accumulated OCI and Basel 3 capital is reduced over time by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income. For more information on the transition provisions of Basel 3, see Capital Management Regulatory Capital on page 57 . Table 71 Estimated Net Interest Income Excluding Trading-related Net Interest Income (Dollars in millions) Curve Change Short Rate (bps) Long Rate (bps) September 30 2015 December 31 2014 Parallel shifts +100 bps instantaneous shift +100 +100 $ 4,534 $ 3,685 -50 bps instantaneous shift -50 -50 (3,814 ) (3,043 ) Flatteners Short-end instantaneous change +100 2,545 1,966 Long-end instantaneous change -50 (2,145 ) (1,772 ) Steepeners Short-end instantaneous change -50 (1,640 ) (1,261 ) Long-end instantaneous change +100 2,072 1,782 The sensitivity analysis in Table 71 assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates. As part of our ALM activities, we use securities, residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity. The behavior of our deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income. The sensitivity analysis in Table 71 assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher-yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce the Corporation's benefit in those scenarios. Securities The securities portfolio is an integral part of our interest rate risk management, which includes our ALM positioning, and is primarily comprised of debt securities including MBS and U.S. Treasury securities. As part of the ALM positioning, we use derivatives to hedge interest rate and duration risk. At September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 , our debt securities portfolio had a carrying value of $391.7 billion and $380.5 billion . During the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 , we purchased debt securities of $79.8 billion and $79.9 billion, sold $60.7 billion and $39.3 billion, and had maturities and received paydowns of $26.7 billion and $25.7 billion, respectively. We realized $385 million and $432 million in net gains on sales of AFS debt securities during the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 . During the three months ended September 30, 2015 , we also exchanged loans supported by long-term standby agreements with FNMA and FHLMC with a fair value of $6.3 billion into debt securities guaranteed by FNMA and FHLMC, of which we retained $5.0 billion. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 , we purchased debt securities of $168.3 billion and $185.6 billion , sold $101.1 billion and $81.6 billion , and had maturities and received paydowns of $70.9 billion and $65.5 billion , respectively. We realized $821 million and $1.2 billion in net gains on sales of AFS debt securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 . During the nine months ended September 30, 2015 , we also exchanged loans supported by long-term standby agreements with FNMA and FHLMC with a fair value of $16.7 billion into debt securities guaranteed by FNMA and FHLMC, of which we retained $15.1 billion. 119 Table of Contents At September 30, 2015 , accumulated OCI included after-tax net unrealized gains of $1.6 billion on AFS debt securities and after-tax net unrealized gains of $15 million on AFS marketable equity securities compared to after-tax net unrealized losses of $656 million and after-tax net unrealized losses of $5 million at September 30, 2014 . For more information on accumulated OCI, see Note 12 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) to the Consolidated Financial Statements . The pretax net amounts in accumulated OCI related to AFS debt securities increased $2.4 billion and $359 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 to a $2.5 billion net unrealized gain primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates. For more information on our securities portfolio, see Note 3 Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Residential Mortgage Portfolio At September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 , our residential mortgage portfolio was $187.9 billion and $216.2 billion excluding $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion of consumer residential mortgage loans accounted for under the fair value option at each period end. For more information on consumer fair value option loans, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Consumer Loans Accounted for Under the Fair Value Option on page 91 . The $28.3 billion decrease in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily due to loan sales of $23.6 billion, including $16.4 billion of loans with standby insurance agreements, $2.5 billion of nonperforming and other delinquent loans, $4.5 billion of loans in consolidated agency residential mortgage securitization vehicles, and runoff outpacing the retention of new originations. These declines were partially offset by repurchases of delinquent loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA, which are part of our mortgage banking activities. Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2014 During the three months ended September 30, 2015 , Consumer Banking and GWIM originated $8.7 billion of first-lien mortgages that we retained compared to $6.2 billion in the same period in 2014 . We received paydowns of $8.8 billion compared to $10.2 billion in the same period in 2014 . We repurchased $501 million of loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA and redelivered $872 million, primarily FHA-insured loans, compared to repurchases of $1.5 billion and redeliveries of $687 million in the same period in 2014 . Sales of loans, excluding redelivered FHA-insured loans, were $10.0 billion compared to $9.1 billion in the same period in 2014 . Gains recognized on the sales of residential mortgages were $399 million compared to $210 million in the same period in 2014 . Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014 During the nine months ended September 30, 2015 , Consumer Banking and GWIM originated $26.4 billion of first-lien mortgages that we retained compared to $16.8 billion in the same period in 2014 . We received paydowns of $29.6 billion compared to $28.0 billion in the same period in 2014 . We repurchased $2.3 billion of loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA and redelivered $2.2 billion, primarily FHA-insured loans, compared to repurchases of $3.8 billion and redeliveries of $3.0 billion in the same period in 2014 . Sales of loans, excluding redelivered FHA-insured loans, were $23.6 billion compared to $12.2 million in the same period in 2014 . Gains recognized on the sales of residential mortgages were $916 million compared to $392 million in the same period in 2014 . Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative Contracts Interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts are utilized in our ALM activities and serve as an efficient tool to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk. We use derivatives to hedge the variability in cash flows or changes in fair value on our balance sheet due to interest rate and foreign exchange components. For more information on our hedging activities, see Note 2 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Our interest rate contracts are generally non-leveraged generic interest rate and foreign exchange basis swaps, options, futures and forwards. In addition, we use foreign exchange contracts, including cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign currency futures contracts, foreign currency forward contracts and options to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Changes to the composition of our derivatives portfolio during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 reflect actions taken for interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk management. The decisions to reposition our derivatives portfolio are based on the current assessment of economic and financial conditions including the interest rate and foreign currency environments, balance sheet composition and trends, and the relative mix of our cash and derivative positions. 120 Table of Contents Table 72 presents derivatives utilized in our ALM activities including those designated as accounting and economic hedging instruments and shows the notional amount, fair value, weighted-average receive-fixed and pay-fixed rates, expected maturity and average estimated durations of our open ALM derivatives at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . These amounts do not include derivative hedges on our MSRs.

(2) At September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 , the notional amount of same-currency basis swaps included $81.8 billion and $94.4 billion in both foreign currency and U.S. Dollar-denominated basis swaps in which both sides of the swap are in the same currency. (3) Foreign exchange basis swaps consisted of cross-currency variable interest rate swaps used separately or in conjunction with receive-fixed interest rate swaps. (4) Does not include foreign currency translation adjustments on certain non-U.S. debt issued by the Corporation that substantially offset the fair values of these derivatives. (5) The notional amount of option products of $15 million at September 30, 2015 was comprised of purchased caps/floors. Option products of $980 million at December 31, 2014 were comprised of $974 million in foreign exchange options, $16 million in purchased caps/floors and $(10) million in swaptions. (6) Reflects the net of long and short positions. Amounts shown as negative reflect a net short position. (7) The notional amount of foreign exchange contracts of $(24.4) billion at September 30, 2015 was comprised of $22.2 billion in foreign currency-denominated and cross-currency receive-fixed swaps, $(40.3) billion in net foreign currency forward rate contracts, $(7.8) billion in foreign currency-denominated pay-fixed swaps and $1.5 billion in net foreign currency futures contracts. Foreign exchange contracts of $(22.6) billion at December 31, 2014 were comprised of $21.0 billion in foreign currency-denominated and cross-currency receive-fixed swaps, $(36.4) billion in net foreign currency forward rate contracts, $(8.3) billion in foreign currency-denominated pay-fixed swaps and $1.1 billion in foreign currency futures contracts. 121 Table of Contents We use interest rate derivative instruments to hedge the variability in the cash flows of our assets and liabilities and other forecasted transactions (collectively referred to as cash flow hedges). The net losses on both open and terminated cash flow hedge derivative instruments recorded in accumulated OCI were $2.0 billion and $2.7 billion , on a pretax basis, at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . These net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the same period as the hedged cash flows affect earnings and will decrease income or increase expense on the respective hedged cash flows. Assuming no change in open cash flow derivative hedge positions and no changes in prices or interest rates beyond what is implied in forward yield curves at September 30, 2015 , the pretax net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings as follows: $643 million , or 32 percent, within the next year, 40 percent in years two through five, and 18 percent in years six through ten, with the remaining 10 percent thereafter. For more information on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, see Note 2 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . We hedge our net investment in non-U.S. operations determined to have functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar using forward foreign exchange contracts that typically settle in less than 180 days, cross-currency basis swaps and foreign exchange options. We recorded net after-tax losses on derivatives in accumulated OCI associated with net investment hedges which were offset by gains on our net investments in consolidated non-U.S. entities at September 30, 2015 . Mortgage Banking Risk Management We originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. We determine whether loans will be HFI or held-for-sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate. Interest rate risk and market risk can be substantial in the mortgage business. Fluctuations in interest rates drive consumer demand for new mortgages and the level of refinancing activity which, in turn, affects total origination and servicing income. Hedging the various sources of interest rate risk in mortgage banking is a complex process that requires complex modeling and ongoing monitoring. Typically, an increase in mortgage interest rates will lead to a decrease in mortgage originations and related fees. IRLCs and the related residential first-mortgage LHFS are subject to interest rate risk between the date of the IRLC and the date the loans are sold to the secondary market, as an increase in mortgage interest rates will typically lead to a decrease in the value of these instruments. MSRs are nonfinancial assets created when the underlying mortgage loan is sold to investors and we retain the right to service the loan. Typically, an increase in mortgage rates will lead to an increase in the value of the MSRs driven by lower prepayment expectations. This increase in value from increases in mortgage rates is opposite of, and therefore offsets, the risk described for IRLCs and LHFS. Because the interest rate risks of these two hedged items offset, we combine them into one overall hedged item with one combined economic hedge portfolio. Interest rate and certain market risks of IRLCs and residential mortgage LHFS are economically hedged in combination with MSRs. To hedge these combined assets, we use certain derivatives such as interest rate options, interest rate swaps, forward sale commitments, eurodollar and U.S. Treasury futures, and mortgage TBAs, as well as other securities including agency MBS, principal-only and interest-only MBS and U.S. Treasury securities. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 , we recorded gains in mortgage banking income of $389 million and $325 million related to the change in fair value of the derivative contracts and other securities used to hedge the market risks of the MSRs and funded LHFS compared to gains of $70 million and $598 million for the same periods in 2014 . For more information on MSRs, see Note 17 Mortgage Servicing Rights to the Consolidated Financial Statements and for more information on mortgage banking income, see Consumer Banking on page 27 . 122 Table of Contents Compliance Risk Management Compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss or damage to the reputation of the Corporation in the event of the failure of the Corporation to comply with the requirements of applicable laws, rules, regulations, related self-regulatory organization standards and codes of conduct (collectively, applicable laws, rules and regulations). Global Compliance independently assesses compliance risk, and evaluates adherence to applicable laws, rules and regulations, including identifying compliance issues and risks, performing monitoring and testing, and reporting on the state of compliance activities across the Corporation. Additionally, Global Compliance works with Front Line Units (FLUs) and control functions so that day-to-day activities operate in a compliant manner. For more information on FLUs and control functions, see Managing Risk on page 55 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K . The Corporation's approach to the management of compliance risk is further described in the Global Compliance Enterprise Policy, which outlines the requirements of the Corporation's global compliance program, and defines roles and responsibilities related to the implementation, execution and management of the compliance program by Global Compliance. The requirements work together to drive a comprehensive risk-based approach for the proactive identification, management and escalation of compliance risks throughout the Corporation. The Global Compliance Enterprise Policy sets the requirements for reporting compliance risk information to executive management as well as the Board or appropriate Board-level committees with an outline for conducting objective oversight of the Corporation's compliance risk management activities. The Board provides oversight of compliance risk through its Audit Committee and ERC. Operational Risk Management The Corporation defines operational risk as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Operational risk may occur anywhere in the Corporation, including third-party business processes, and is not limited to operations functions. Effects may extend beyond financial losses and may result in reputational risk impacts. Operational risk includes legal risk. Successful operational risk management is particularly important to diversified financial services companies because of the nature, volume and complexity of the financial services business. Operational risk is a significant component in the calculation of total risk-weighted assets used in the Basel 3 capital estimate under the Advanced approaches. For more information on Basel 3 Advanced approaches, see Capital Management Advanced Approaches on page 59 . We approach operational risk management from two perspectives within the structure of the Corporation: (1) at the enterprise level to provide independent, integrated management of operational risk across the organization, and (2) at the business and control function levels to address operational risk in revenue producing and non-revenue producing units. The Operational Risk Management Program addresses the overarching processes for identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling operational risk, and reporting operational risk information to management and the Board. A sound internal governance structure enhances the effectiveness of the Corporation's Operational Risk Management Program and is accomplished at the enterprise level through formal oversight by the Board, the ERC, the Chief Risk Officer and a variety of management committees and risk oversight groups aligned to the Corporation's overall risk governance framework and practices. Of these, the MRC oversees the Corporation's policies and processes for sound operational risk management. The MRC also serves as an escalation point for critical operational risk matters within the Corporation. The MRC reports operational risk activities to the ERC. The independent operational risk management teams oversee the businesses and control functions to monitor adherence to the Operational Risk Management Program and advise and challenge operational risk exposures. Within the Global Risk Management organization, the Corporate Operational Risk team develops and guides the strategies, enterprise-wide policies, practices, controls and monitoring tools for assessing and managing operational risks across the organization and reports results to businesses, control functions, senior management, management committees, the ERC and the Board. The businesses and control functions are responsible for assessing, monitoring and managing all the risks within their units, including operational risks. In addition to enterprise risk management tools such as loss reporting, scenario analysis and Risk and Control Self Assessments (RCSAs), operational risk executives, working in conjunction with senior business executives, have developed key tools to help identify, measure, monitor and control risk in each business and control function. Examples of these include personnel management practices; data management, data quality controls and related processes; fraud management units; cybersecurity controls, processes and systems; transaction processing, monitoring and analysis; business recovery planning; and new product introduction processes. The business and control functions are also responsible for consistently implementing and monitoring adherence to corporate practices. 123 Table of Contents Business and control function management uses the enterprise RCSA process to capture the identification and assessment of operational risk exposures and evaluate the status of risk and control issues including mitigation plans, as appropriate. The goals of this process are to assess changing market and business conditions, evaluate key risks impacting each business and control function, and assess the controls in place to mitigate the risks. Key operational risk indicators have been developed and are used to assist in identifying trends and issues on an enterprise, business and control function level. Independent review and challenge to the Corporation's overall operational risk management framework is performed by the Corporate Operational Risk Program Adherence Team and reported through the operational risk governance committees and management routines. Where appropriate, insurance policies are purchased to mitigate the impact of operational losses. These insurance policies are explicitly incorporated in the structural features of operational risk evaluation. As insurance recoveries, especially given recent market events, are subject to legal and financial uncertainty, the inclusion of these insurance policies is subject to reductions in their expected mitigating benefits. Complex Accounting Estimates Our significant accounting principles, as described in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K , are essential in understanding the MD&A. Many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments. The more judgmental estimates impacting results for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 are summarized in the following discussion. We have identified and described the development of the variables most important in the estimation processes that involve mathematical models to derive the estimates. In many cases, there are numerous alternative judgments that could be used in the process of determining the inputs to the models. Where alternatives exist, we have used the factors that we believe represent the most reasonable value in developing the inputs. Actual performance that differs from our estimates of the key variables could impact our results of operations. Separate from the possible future impact to our results of operations from input and model variables, the value of our lending portfolio and market-sensitive assets and liabilities may change subsequent to the balance sheet date, often significantly, due to the nature and magnitude of future credit and market conditions. Such credit and market conditions may change quickly and in unforeseen ways and the resulting volatility could have a significant, negative effect on future operating results. These fluctuations would not be indicative of deficiencies in our models or inputs. For additional information, see Complex Accounting Estimates on page 109 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Fair Value of Financial Instruments We classify the fair values of financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established under applicable accounting guidance which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Applicable accounting guidance establishes three levels of inputs used to measure fair value. For additional information, see Note 14 Fair Value Measurements and Note 15 Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements , and Complex Accounting Estimates on page 109 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Level 3 Assets and Liabilities Financial assets and liabilities where values are based on valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and are significant to the overall fair value measurement are classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy established in applicable accounting guidance. The Level 3 financial assets and liabilities include certain loans, MBS, ABS, collateralized debt obligations, CLOs and structured liabilities, as well as highly structured, complex or long-dated derivative contracts, private equity investments and consumer MSRs. The fair value of these Level 3 financial assets and liabilities is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. 124 Table of Contents Table 73 Recurring Level 3 Asset and Liability Summary September 30, 2015 December 31, 2014 (Dollars in millions) Level 3 Fair Value As a % of Total Level 3 Assets As a % of Total Assets Level 3 Fair Value As a % of Total Level 3 Assets As a % of Total Assets Trading account assets $ 5,698 29.45 % 0.26 % $ 6,259 28.12 % 0.30 % Derivative assets 6,014 31.09 0.28 6,851 30.77 0.33 AFS debt securities 1,342 6.94 0.06 2,555 11.48 0.12 Loans and leases 1,984 10.26 0.09 1,983 8.91 0.09 Mortgage servicing rights 3,043 15.73 0.14 3,530 15.86 0.17 All other Level 3 assets at fair value 1,264 6.53 0.07 1,084 4.86 0.05 Total Level 3 assets at fair value (1) $ 19,345 100.00 % 0.90 % $ 22,262 100.00 % 1.06 % Level 3 Fair Value As a % of Total Level 3 Liabilities As a % of Total Liabilities Level 3 Fair Value As a % of Total Level 3 Liabilities As a % of Total Liabilities Derivative liabilities $ 5,617 72.12 % 0.30 % $ 7,771 76.34 % 0.42 % Long-term debt 1,910 24.52 0.10 2,362 23.20 0.13 All other Level 3 liabilities at fair value 261 3.36 0.01 46 0.46 Total Level 3 liabilities at fair value (1) $ 7,788 100.00 % 0.41 % $ 10,179 100.00 % 0.55 % (1) Level 3 total assets and liabilities are shown before the impact of cash collateral and counterparty netting related to our derivative positions. Level 3 financial instruments may be hedged with derivatives classified as Level 1 or 2; therefore, gains or losses associated with Level 3 financial instruments may be offset by gains or losses associated with financial instruments classified in other levels of the fair value hierarchy. The Level 3 gains and losses recorded in earnings did not have a significant impact on our liquidity or capital resources. We conduct a review of our fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of Level 3 are made if the significant inputs used in the financial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities became unobservable or observable, respectively, in the current marketplace. These transfers are considered to be effective as of the beginning of the quarter in which they occur. For more information on the significant transfers into and out of Level 3 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 , see Note 14 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Goodwill and Intangible Assets Background The nature of and accounting for goodwill and intangible assets are discussed in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 8 Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2014 Annual report on Form 10-K as well as Complex Accounting Estimates on page 109 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Goodwill is reviewed for potential impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis, which for the Corporation is as of June 30, and in interim periods if events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below. As reporting units are determined after an acquisition or evolve with changes in business strategy, goodwill is assigned to reporting units and it no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition. All of the revenue streams and related activities of a reporting unit, whether acquired or organic, are available to support the value of the goodwill. 125 Table of Contents 2015 Annual Goodwill Impairment Testing Estimating the fair value of reporting units is a subjective process that involves the use of estimates and judgments, particularly related to cash flows, the appropriate discount rates and an applicable control premium. We determined the fair values of the reporting units using a combination of valuation techniques consistent with the market approach and the income approach and also utilized independent valuation specialists. The market approach we used estimates the fair value of the individual reporting units by incorporating any combination of the tangible capital, book capital and earnings multiples from comparable publicly-traded companies in industries similar to the reporting unit. The relative weight assigned to these multiples varies among the reporting units based on qualitative and quantitative characteristics, primarily the size and relative profitability of the reporting unit as compared to the comparable publicly-traded companies. Since the fair values determined under the market approach are representative of a noncontrolling interest, we added a control premium to arrive at the reporting units' estimated fair values on a controlling basis. For purposes of the income approach, we calculated discounted cash flows by taking the net present value of estimated future cash flows and an appropriate terminal value. Our discounted cash flow analysis employs a capital asset pricing model in estimating the discount rate (i.e., cost of equity financing) for each reporting unit. The inputs to this model include the risk-free rate of return, beta, which is a measure of the level of non-diversifiable risk associated with comparable companies for each specific reporting unit, market equity risk premium and in certain cases an unsystematic (company-specific) risk factor. The unsystematic risk factor is the input that specifically addresses uncertainty related to our projections of earnings and growth, including the uncertainty related to loss expectations. We utilized discount rates that we believe adequately reflect the risk and uncertainty in the financial markets generally and specifically in our internally developed forecasts. We estimated expected rates of equity returns based on historical market returns and risk/return rates for industries similar to each reporting unit. We use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and actual results may differ from forecasted results. During the three months ended September 30, 2015 , we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of June 30, 2015 for all of our reporting units that had goodwill. In performing the first step of the annual goodwill impairment analysis, we compared the fair value of each reporting unit to its estimated carrying value as measured by allocated equity, which includes goodwill. We also evaluated the U.K. Card business within All Other , as the U.K. Card business comprises substantially all of the goodwill included in All Other . To determine fair value, we utilized a combination of the market approach and the income approach. Under the market approach, we compared earnings and equity multiples of the individual reporting units to multiples of public companies comparable to the individual reporting units. The control premium used in the June 30, 2015 annual goodwill impairment test was 30 percent, based upon observed comparable premiums paid for change in control transactions for financial institutions, for all reporting units. Under the income approach, we updated our assumptions to reflect the current market environment. The discount rates used in the June 30, 2015 annual goodwill impairment test ranged from 10.2 percent to 13.7 percent depending on the relative risk of a reporting unit. Growth rates developed by management for individual revenue and expense items in each reporting unit ranged from negative 3.5 percent to positive 8.0 percent. The Corporation's market capitalization remained below our recorded book value during the first nine months of 2015 . As none of our reporting units are publicly traded, individual reporting unit fair value determinations may not directly correlate to the Corporation's market capitalization. We considered the comparison of the aggregate fair value of the reporting units with assigned goodwill to the Corporation's market capitalization as of June 30, 2015 . Although we believe it is reasonable to conclude that market capitalization could be an indicator of fair value over time, we do not believe that our current market capitalization would reflect the aggregate fair value of our individual reporting units with assigned goodwill, as reporting units with no assigned goodwill have not been valued and are excluded (e.g., LAS ) from the comparison and our market capitalization does not include consideration of individual reporting unit control premiums. Although the individual reporting units have considered the impact of recent regulatory changes in their forecasts and valuations, overall regulatory and market uncertainties persist that we believe further impact the Corporation's stock price. Based on the results of step one of the annual goodwill impairment test, we determined that step two was not required for any of the reporting units as their fair value exceeded their carrying value indicating there was no impairment. 126 Table of Contents Table 74 shows goodwill assigned to the individual reporting units and the fair value as a percentage of the carrying value as of our June 30, 2015 annual goodwill impairment test. Table 74 Goodwill by Reporting Unit (1) June 30, 2015 (Dollars in millions) Estimated Fair Value as a Percent of Allocated Carrying Value Goodwill Consumer Banking Deposits 138.7 % $ 18,414 Card Services 254.8 10,014 Consumer Vehicle Lending 127.8 1,695 Global Wealth & Investment Management U.S. Trust 196.7 2,922 Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management 323.4 6,776 Global Banking Global Commercial Banking 160.2 16,146 Global Corporate and Investment Banking 184.5 6,231 Business Banking 176.6 1,546 Global Markets 141.8 5,197 All Other (2) 282.9 775 (1) There was no goodwill in Home Loans within Consumer Banking or LAS as of June 30, 2015 . (2) Reflects the goodwill and fair value as a percent of allocated carrying value assigned to the U.K. Card business within All Other . The total amount of goodwill in All Other was $834 million at June 30, 2015 . In estimating the fair value of the reporting units in step one of the annual goodwill impairment analysis, the fair values can be sensitive to changes in the projected cash flows and assumptions. In some instances, minor changes in the assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value. Furthermore, a prolonged decrease or increase in a particular assumption could eventually lead to the fair value of a reporting unit being less than its carrying value. Also, under step two of the annual goodwill impairment analysis, which was not required for any of our reporting units at June 30, 2015 , changes in the estimated fair values of the individual assets and liabilities may result in a different amount of implied goodwill, and ultimately the amount of goodwill impairment, if any. 127 Table of Contents Glossary Alt-A Mortgage A type of U.S. mortgage that, for various reasons, is considered riskier than A-paper, or "prime," and less risky than "subprime," the riskiest category. Alt-A interest rates, which are determined by credit risk, therefore tend to be between those of prime and subprime consumer real estate loans. Typically, Alt-A mortgages are characterized by borrowers with less than full documentation, lower credit scores and higher LTVs. Assets in Custody Consist largely of custodial and non-discretionary trust assets excluding brokerage assets administered for clients. Trust assets encompass a broad range of asset types including real estate, private company ownership interest, personal property and investments. Assets Under Management (AUM) The total market value of assets under the investment advisory and/or discretion of GWIM which generate asset management fees based on a percentage of the assets' market values. AUM reflects assets that are generally managed for institutional, high net worth and retail clients, and are distributed through various investment products including mutual funds, other commingled vehicles and separate accounts. AUM is classified in two categories, Liquidity AUM and Long-term AUM. Liquidity AUM are assets under advisory and discretion of GWIM in which the investment strategy seeks current income, while maintaining liquidity and capital preservation. The duration of these strategies is primarily less than one year. Long-term AUM are assets under advisory and/or discretion of GWIM in which the duration of investment strategy is longer than one year. Carrying Value (with respect to loans) The amount at which a loan is recorded on the balance sheet. For loans recorded at amortized cost, carrying value is the unpaid principal balance net of unamortized deferred loan origination fees and costs, and unamortized purchase premium or discount. For loans that are or have been on nonaccrual status, the carrying value is also reduced by any net charge-offs that have been recorded and the amount of interest payments applied as a reduction of principal under the cost recovery method. For PCI loans, the carrying value equals fair value upon acquisition adjusted for subsequent cash collections and yield accreted to date. For credit card loans, the carrying value also includes interest that has been billed to the customer. For loans classified as held-for-sale, carrying value is the lower of carrying value as described in the sentences above, or fair value. For loans for which we have elected the fair value option, the carrying value is fair value. Client Brokerage Assets Include client assets which are held in brokerage accounts. This includes non-discretionary brokerage and fee-based assets which generate brokerage income and asset management fee revenue. Committed Credit Exposure Includes any funded portion of a facility plus the unfunded portion of a facility on which the lender is legally bound to advance funds during a specified period under prescribed conditions. Credit Derivatives Contractual agreements that provide protection against a credit event on one or more referenced obligations. The nature of a credit event is established by the protection purchaser and the protection seller at the inception of the transaction, and such events generally include bankruptcy or insolvency of the referenced credit entity, failure to meet payment obligations when due, as well as acceleration of indebtedness and payment repudiation or moratorium. The purchaser of the credit derivative pays a periodic fee in return for a payment by the protection seller upon the occurrence, if any, of such a credit event. A credit default swap is a type of credit derivative. Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) A portfolio adjustment required to properly reflect the counterparty credit risk exposure as part of the fair value of derivative instruments. Debit Valuation Adjustment (DVA) A portfolio adjustment required to properly reflect the Corporation's own credit risk exposure as part of the fair value of derivative instruments and/or structured liabilities. Funding Valuation Adjustment (FVA) A portfolio adjustment required to include funding costs on uncollateralized derivatives and derivatives where the Corporation is not permitted to use the collateral it receives. Interest Rate Lock Commitment (IRLC) Commitment with a loan applicant in which the loan terms, including interest rate and price, are guaranteed for a designated period of time subject to credit approval. Letter of Credit A document issued on behalf of a customer to a third party promising to pay the third party upon presentation of specified documents. A letter of credit effectively substitutes the issuer's credit for that of the customer. 128 Table of Contents Loan-to-value (LTV) A commonly used credit quality metric that is reported in terms of ending and average LTV. Ending LTV is calculated as the outstanding carrying value of the loan at the end of the period divided by the estimated value of the property securing the loan. An additional metric related to LTV is combined loan-to-value (CLTV) which is similar to the LTV metric, yet combines the outstanding balance on the residential mortgage loan and the outstanding carrying value on the home equity loan or available line of credit, both of which are secured by the same property, divided by the estimated value of the property. A LTV of 100 percent reflects a loan that is currently secured by a property valued at an amount exactly equal to the carrying value or available line of the loan. Estimated property values are generally determined through the use of automated valuation models (AVMs) or the CoreLogic Case-Shiller Index. An AVM is a tool that estimates the value of a property by reference to large volumes of market data including sales of comparable properties and price trends specific to the MSA in which the property being valued is located. CoreLogic Case-Shiller is a widely used index based on data from repeat sales of single family homes. CoreLogic Case-Shiller indexed-based values are reported on a three-month or one-quarter lag. Margin Receivable An extension of credit secured by eligible securities in certain brokerage accounts. Market-related Adjustments Include a djustments to premium amortization or discount accretion on debt securities when a decrease in long-term rates shortens (or an increase extends) the estimated lives of mortgage-related debt securities. Also included in market-related adjustments is hedge ineffectiveness that impacts net interest income. Mortgage Servicing Right (MSR) The right to service a mortgage loan when the underlying loan is sold or securitized. Servicing includes collections for principal, interest and escrow payments from borrowers and accounting for and remitting principal and interest payments to investors. Net Interest Yield Net interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets. Nonperforming Loans and Leases Include loans and leases that have been placed on nonaccrual status, including nonaccruing loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties (TDRs). Loans accounted for under the fair value option, PCI loans and LHFS are not reported as nonperforming loans and leases. Consumer credit card loans, business card loans, consumer loans secured by personal property (except for certain secured consumer loans, including those that have been modified in a TDR), and consumer loans secured by real estate that are insured by the FHA or through long-term credit protection agreements with FNMA and FHLMC (fully-insured loan portfolio) are not placed on nonaccrual status and are, therefore, not reported as nonperforming loans and leases. Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) A framework established by the U.S. banking regulators requiring banks to maintain certain levels of regulatory capital ratios, comprised of five categories of capitalization: "well capitalized," "adequately capitalized," "undercapitalized," "significantly undercapitalized" and "critically undercapitalized." Insured depository institutions that fail to meet these capital levels are subject to increasingly strict limits on their activities, including their ability to make capital distributions, pay management compensation, grow assets and take other actions. Purchased Credit-impaired (PCI) Loan A loan purchased as an individual loan, in a portfolio of loans or in a business combination with evidence of deterioration in credit quality since origination for which it is probable, upon acquisition, that the investor will be unable to collect all contractually required payments. These loans are recorded at fair value upon acquisition. Subprime Loans Although a standard industry definition for subprime loans (including subprime mortgage loans) does not exist, the Corporation defines subprime loans as specific product offerings for higher risk borrowers, including individuals with one or a combination of high credit risk factors, such as low FICO scores, high debt to income ratios and inferior payment history. Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs) Loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. Certain consumer loans for which a binding offer to restructure has been extended are also classified as TDRs. Concessions could include a reduction in the interest rate to a rate that is below market on the loan, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance, loans discharged in bankruptcy or other actions intended to maximize collection. Secured consumer loans that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not been reaffirmed by the borrower are classified as TDRs at the time of discharge from bankruptcy. TDRs are generally reported as nonperforming loans and leases while on nonaccrual status. Nonperforming TDRs may be returned to accrual status when, among other criteria, payment in full of all amounts due under the restructured terms is expected and the borrower has demonstrated a sustained period of repayment performance, generally six months. TDRs that are on accrual status are reported as performing TDRs through the end of the calendar year in which the restructuring occurred or the year in which they are returned to accrual status. In addition, if accruing TDRs bear less than a market rate of interest at the time of modification, they are reported as performing TDRs throughout their remaining lives unless and until they cease to perform in accordance with their modified contractual terms, at which time they would be placed on nonaccrual status and reported as nonperforming TDRs. Value-at-Risk (VaR) VaR is a model that simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of hypothetical scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR represents the loss the portfolio is expected to experience with a given confidence level based on historical data. A VaR model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of potential gains and losses on our trading portfolios. 129 Table of Contents Acronyms ABS Asset-backed securities AFS Available-for-sale ALM Asset and liability management ARM Adjustable-rate mortgage AUM Assets under management BHC Bank holding company CCAR Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review CDO Collateralized debt obligation CLO Collateralized loan obligation CRA Community Reinvestment Act CVA Credit valuation adjustment DVA Debit valuation adjustment EAD Exposure at default ERC Enterprise Risk Committee FHA Federal Housing Administration FHLB Federal Home Loan Bank FHLMC Freddie Mac FICC Fixed-income, currencies and commodities FICO Fair Isaac Corporation (credit score) FLUs Front line units FNMA Fannie Mae FSB Financial Stability Board FTE Fully taxable-equivalent FVA Funding valuation adjustment GAAP Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GNMA Government National Mortgage Association GSE Government-sponsored enterprise HELOC Home equity lines of credit HFI Held-for-investment HQLA High Quality Liquid Assets HUD U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development LCR Liquidity Coverage Ratio LGD Loss-given default LHFS Loans held-for-sale LIBOR London InterBank Offered Rate LTV Loan-to-value MBS Mortgage-backed securities MD&A Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MI Mortgage insurance MRC Management Risk Committee MSR Mortgage servicing right NSFR Net Stable Funding Ratio OCI Other comprehensive income OTC Over-the-counter OTTI Other-than-temporary impairment PCA Prompt Corrective Action PCI Purchased credit-impaired PPI Payment protection insurance RCSAs Risk and Control Self Assessments RMBS Residential mortgage-backed securities SEC Securities and Exchange Commission SLR Supplementary leverage ratio TDR Troubled debt restructurings TLAC Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity VIE Variable interest entity 130 Table of Contents
