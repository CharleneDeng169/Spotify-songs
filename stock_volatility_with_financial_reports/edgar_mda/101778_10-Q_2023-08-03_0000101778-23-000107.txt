Basis of Presentation These consolidated financial statements are unaudited; however, in the opinion of management, these statements reflect all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the periods reported. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature unless disclosed otherwise. These consolidated financial statements, including notes, have been prepared in accordance with the applicable rules of the SEC and do not include all of the information and disclosures required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The results of operations for the second quarter and first six months of 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. 2. Accounting Standards Accounting Standards Updates Adopted No accounting standards were adopted in the second quarter of 2023 that had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Accounting Standards Updates Not Yet Adopted There were no issued but pending accounting standards expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 3. Income and Dividends per Common Share Basic income per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted income per share assumes exercise of stock options in all periods, provided the effect is not antidilutive. The per share calculations below exclude 1 million of antidilutive stock options for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2 million of antidilutive stock options for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively.

Revenues The majority of our revenues are derived from the sale of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas under spot and term agreements with our customers in the United States and Equatorial Guinea. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, receivables from contracts with customers, included in receivables, less reserves for credit losses, were $ 892 million and $ 875 million, respectively. The following tables present our revenues from contracts with customers disaggregated by product type and geographic areas for the three and six months ended June 30: 7 Table of Contents MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) United States Three Months Ended June 30, 2023 (In millions) Eagle Ford Bakken Oklahoma Permian Other U.S. Total Crude oil and condensate $ 524 $ 456 $ 63 $ 141 $ 11 $ 1,195 Natural gas liquids 64 41 33 18 156 Natural gas 37 14 28 7 86 Other 1 2 3 Revenues from contracts with customers $ 626 $ 511 $ 124 $ 166 $ 13 $ 1,440 Three Months Ended June 30, 2022 (In millions) Eagle Ford Bakken Oklahoma Permian Other U.S. Total Crude oil and condensate $ 544 $ 749 $ 138 $ 100 $ 42 $ 1,573 Natural gas liquids 55 92 69 15 8 239 Natural gas 56 46 95 21 10 228 Other 1 48 49 Revenues from contracts with customers $ 656 $ 887 $ 302 $ 136 $ 108 $ 2,089 Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 (In millions) Eagle Ford Bakken Oklahoma Permian Other U.S. Total Crude oil and condensate $ 1,019 $ 887 $ 141 $ 311 $ 22 $ 2,380 Natural gas liquids 135 78 72 40 325 Natural gas 93 49 64 18 1 225 Other 3 10 13 Revenues from contracts with customers $ 1,250 $ 1,014 $ 277 $ 369 $ 33 $ 2,943 Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 (In millions) Eagle Ford Bakken Oklahoma Permian Other U.S. Total Crude oil and condensate $ 1,003 $ 1,401 $ 237 $ 188 $ 85 $ 2,914 Natural gas liquids 99 181 128 30 17 455 Natural gas 89 89 151 33 17 379 Other 3 52 55 Revenues from contracts with customers $ 1,194 $ 1,671 $ 516 $ 251 $ 171 $ 3,803 International (E.G.)

Segment Information We have two reportable operating segments. Both of these segments are organized and managed based upon geographic location and the nature of the products and services offered. United States ( U.S. ) explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas in the United States; and International ( Int l ) explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas outside of the United States as well as produces and markets products manufactured from natural gas, such as LNG and methanol, in Equatorial Guinea ( E.G. ) Segment income represents income that excludes certain items not allocated to our operating segments, net of income taxes. A portion of our corporate and operations general and administrative support costs are not allocated to the operating segments. These unallocated costs primarily consist of employment costs (including pension effects), professional services, facilities and other costs associated with corporate and operations support activities. Additionally, items which affect comparability such as: gains or losses on dispositions, impairments of proved and certain unproved properties, dry wells, changes in our valuation allowance, unrealized gains or losses on commodity and interest rate derivative instruments, effects of pension settlements and curtailments, expensed transaction costs for business combinations or other items (as determined by the chief operating decision maker ( CODM )) are not allocated to operating segments.

Income Taxes Effective Tax Rate The effective income tax rate is influenced by a variety of factors including the geographic and functional sources of income and the relative magnitude of these sources of income. The difference between the total provision and the sum of the amounts allocated to segments is reported in the Not Allocated to Segments column of the tables in Note 5 . For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, our effective income tax rates were as follows: Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Effective income tax rate 21 % 22 % 21 % ( 12 ) % 2022 Our effective income tax rate was different from our U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% for the six months ended June 30, 2022, due to the first quarter 2022 release of the valuation allowance on certain U.S. and state deferred tax assets resulting in a non-cash deferred tax benefit of $ 685 million. In August 2022, the President signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 ( IRA ) into law. The IRA enacted various income tax provisions, including a 15% corporate book minimum tax. The corporate book minimum tax, which became effective on January 1, 2023, applies to corporations with an average annual adjusted financial statement income that exceeds $1 billion for the preceding three years. Under current law and guidance, we do not anticipate being subject to the corporate book minimum tax in 2023. The U.S. Treasury is expected to publish further guidance and regulations that will be relevant to scoping considerations and the calculation of minimum income tax liabilities. As this guidance is issued, we will continue to evaluate and assess the impact the IRA may have on our current and future period income taxes. We have made an accounting policy election to consider the effects of the corporate book minimum tax on the realizability of our deferred tax assets, carryforwards and tax credits as a period cost when they arise. 7. Credit Losses The majority of our receivables are from purchasers of commodities or joint interest owners in properties we operate, both of which are recorded at estimated or invoiced amounts and do not bear interest. The majority of these receivables have payment terms of 30 days or less. At the end of each reporting period, we assess the collectability of our receivables and estimate the expected credit losses using historical data, current market conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions and other data as deemed appropriate. Changes in the allowance for credit losses were as follows: (In millions) June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Beginning balance as of January 1 $ 10 $ 15 Current period provision 4 ( 3 ) Current period write offs ( 1 ) ( 2 ) Recoveries of amounts previously reserved ( 1 ) Ending balance $ 12 $ 10 13 Table of Contents MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 8. Inventories Crude oil and natural gas liquids are recorded at weighted average cost and carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Supplies and other items consist principally of tubular goods and equipment which are valued at weighted average cost and reviewed periodically for obsolescence or impairment when market conditions indicate. (In millions) June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Crude oil and natural gas liquids $ 13 $ 15 Supplies and other items 123 110 Inventories $ 136 $ 125 9. Property, Plant and Equipment (In millions) June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 United States $ 17,201 $ 17,034 International 269 288 Corporate 54 55 Net property, plant and equipment $ 17,524 $ 17,377 As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had $ 10 million and $ 20 million, respectively, of exploratory well costs capitalized greater than one year related to suspended wells. Management believes these wells exhibit sufficient quantities of hydrocarbons to justify potential development. All of the suspended wells require completion activities in order to classify the reserves as proved. The decrease during the six months ended June 30, 2023 included a reduction in suspended well costs as we recorded $ 10 million of dry well expense associated with drilled and uncompleted exploratory wells in Permian. 10. Asset Retirement Obligations Asset retirement obligations primarily consist of estimated costs to remove, dismantle and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations. Changes in asset retirement obligations were as follows: June 30, (In millions) 2023 2022 Beginning balance as of January 1 $ 340 $ 316 Incurred liabilities, including acquisitions 3 8 Settled liabilities, including dispositions ( 20 ) ( 3 ) Accretion expense (included in depreciation, depletion and amortization) 7 7 Revisions of estimates 9 ( 5 ) Ending balance as of June 30, total $ 339 $ 323 Ending balance as of June 30, short-term $ 40 $ 46 14 Table of Contents MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 11.

We primarily act as a lessee in these transactions and the majority of our existing leases are classified as either short-term or long-term operating leases. Finance Leases In 2018, we signed an agreement with an owner/lessor to construct and lease a new build-to-suit office building in Houston, Texas. The initial lease term is five years and commenced in late September 2021 after the new Houston office was ready for occupancy. In March 2022, we made our first cash lease payment. During the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, we have made cash lease payments totaling approximately $ 10 million and $ 2 million, respectively. At the end of the initial lease term, we can negotiate to extend the lease term for an additional five years , subject to the approval of the participants; purchase the property subject to certain terms and conditions; or remarket the property to an unrelated third party. The lease contains a residual value guarantee of 100 % of the total acquisition and construction costs. Lessor Our wholly owned subsidiary, Marathon E.G. Production Limited, is a lessor for residential housing in E.G., which is occupied by EGHoldings, a related party equity method investee see Note 20 . The lease was classified as an operating lease and expires in 2024, with a lessee option to extend through 2034. Lease payments are fixed for the entire duration of the agreement at approximately $ 6 million per year. Our lease income is reported in other income in our consolidated statements of income for all periods presented.

Derivatives We may use derivatives to manage a portion of our exposure to commodity price risk, commodity locational risk and interest rate risk. For further information regarding the fair value measurement of derivative instruments, see Note 13 . All of our commodity derivatives and interest rate derivatives are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements under which we report net amounts. The following tables present the gross fair values of our open derivative instruments and the reported net amounts along with their locations in our consolidated balance sheets.

These derivatives are three-way collars. Three-way collars consist of a sold call (ceiling), a purchased put (floor) and a sold put. The ceiling price is the maximum we will receive for the contract volumes; the floor is the minimum price we will receive, unless the market price falls below the sold put strike price. In this case, we receive the NYMEX WTI price or the Henry Hub price plus the difference between the floor and the sold put price. These crude oil and natural gas derivatives were not designated as hedges. 16 Table of Contents MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) The following table sets forth outstanding derivative contracts as of June 30, 2023, and the weighted average prices for those contracts: 2023 Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Crude Oil NYMEX WTI Three-Way Collars Volume (Bbls/day) 10,000 10,000 Weighted average price per Bbl: Ceiling $ 97.59 $ 97.59 Floor $ 60.00 $ 60.00 Sold put $ 45.00 $ 45.00 Natural Gas Henry Hub Three-Way Collars Volume (MMBtu/day) 50,000 50,000 Weighted average price per MMBtu: Ceiling $ 11.14 $ 11.14 Floor $ 4.00 $ 4.00 Sold Put $ 2.50 $ 2.50 The unrealized and realized gain (loss) impact of our commodity derivative instruments appears in the table below and is reflected in net gain (loss) on commodity derivatives in the consolidated statements of income.

During the second quarter and first six months of 2022, net cash paid for settled derivative positions was $ 61 million and $ 89 million, respectively. Interest Rate Swaps During 2020, we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $ 350 million to hedge variations in cash flows arising from fluctuations in the LIBOR benchmark interest rate related to forecasted interest payments of a future debt issuance in 2025. The expected proceeds of the future debt issuance were intended to refinance our $ 900 million 3.85 % Senior Notes due 2025 ( 2025 Notes ). In September 2021, we fully redeemed these 2025 Notes. In March 2022, we closed these positions and settled the interest rate swaps for proceeds of $ 44 million. During the six months ended June 30, 2022, we recorded a cumulative $ 17 million gain within net interest and other within our consolidated statements of income related to these swaps. Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow Hedges During 2019, we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with a maturity date of September 9, 2026 to hedge variations in cash flows related to the interest rate component of future lease payments of our Houston office. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the notional amount of open interest rate swaps for the Houston office was $ 295 million. The weighted average secured overnight financing rate ( SOFR ) for the swaps was 1.43 % as of both June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The Houston office lease commenced in September 2021, however, our first cash lease payment for February 2022 rent was paid in March 2022. The first settlement date for the interest rate swaps was in January 2022. During the six months ended June 30, 2023, net cash received for the settled interest rate swap positions was $ 5 million. As of June 30, 2023, we expect to reclassify a $ 11 million gain from accumulated other comprehensive income into our consolidated statements of income over the next twelve months. See Note 11 for further details regarding Houston office lease. 17 Table of Contents MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 13. Fair Value Measurements Fair Values Recurring The following tables present assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 by hierarchy level. June 30, 2023 (In millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Derivative instruments, assets Commodity (a) $ $ 9 $ $ 9 Interest rate - designated as cash flow hedges 24 24 Derivative instruments, assets $ $ 33 $ $ 33 December 31, 2022 (In millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Derivative instruments, assets Commodity (a) $ $ 10 $ $ 10 Interest rate - designated as cash flow hedges 24 24 Derivative instruments, assets $ $ 34 $ $ 34 (a) Commodity derivative instruments are recorded on a net basis in our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 12 . As of June 30, 2023, our commodity derivatives include three-way collars. These instruments are measured at fair value using either a Black-Scholes or a modified Black-Scholes Model. For three-way collars, inputs to the models include commodity prices and implied volatility and are categorized as Level 2 because predominantly all assumptions and inputs are observable in active markets throughout the term of the instruments. The forward starting interest rate swaps are measured at fair value with a market approach using actionable broker quotes, which are Level 2 inputs. See Note 12 for details on the forward starting interest rate swaps. Fair Values Financial Instruments Our current assets and liabilities include financial instruments, the most significant of which are receivables, the current portion of our long-term debt and payables. We believe the carrying values of our receivables and payables approximate fair value. Our fair value assessment incorporates a variety of considerations, including (1) the short-term duration of the instruments, (2) our credit rating and (3) our historical incurrence of and expected future insignificant bad debt expense, which includes an evaluation of counterparty credit risk. The following table summarizes financial instruments, excluding receivables, payables and derivative financial instruments, and their reported fair values by individual balance sheet line item at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 (In millions) Fair Value Carrying Amount Fair Value Carrying Amount Financial assets Other noncurrent assets $ 10 $ 28 $ 10 $ 28 Total financial assets $ 10 $ 28 $ 10 $ 28 Financial liabilities Other current liabilities $ 130 $ 195 $ 140 $ 204 Long-term debt, including current portion (a) 5,742 5,878 5,806 5,948 Deferred credits and other liabilities 62 63 73 73 Total financial liabilities $ 5,934 $ 6,136 $ 6,019 $ 6,225 (a) Excludes debt issuance costs. 18 Table of Contents MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Fair values of our financial assets included in other noncurrent assets, and of our financial liabilities included in other current liabilities and deferred credits and other liabilities, are measured using an income approach and most inputs are internally generated, which results in a Level 3 classification. Estimated future cash flows are discounted using a rate deemed appropriate to obtain the fair value. Our fixed rate debt instruments are publicly traded. The fair value of our fixed rate debt is measured using a market approach, based upon quotes from major financial institutions, which are Level 2 inputs. Our floating rate debt is non-public and consists of borrowings under our Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility. The fair value of our floating rate debt approximates the carrying value and is estimated based on observable market-based inputs, which results in a Level 2 classification. 14. Debt Term Loan Facility In November 2022, we entered into a term credit agreement, which provides for a two-year $ 1.5 billion term loan facility ( Term Loan Facility ) and we borrowed the full amount thereunder in December 2022. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility can be prepaid without penalty. As of June 30, 2023, we had $ 1.5 billion in borrowings under our Term Loan Facility. The second quarter weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the Term Loan Facility was 6.84 %. The Term Loan Facility includes a covenant requiring our total debt to total capitalization ratio not to exceed 65 % as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. In the event of a default, the lenders holding more than half of the commitments may terminate all of the commitments under the Term Loan Facility and require the immediate repayment of all outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan Facility. As of June 30, 2023, we were in compliance with this covenant with a ratio of 26 %. Revolving Credit Facility As of June 30, 2023, we had borrowings of $ 450 million against our $ 2.5 billion unsecured Revolving Credit Facility. The second quarter weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility was 6.96 %. The Revolving Credit Facility includes a covenant requiring our total debt to total capitalization ratio not to exceed 65 % as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. In the event of a default, the lenders holding more than half of the commitments may terminate the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility and require the immediate repayment of all outstanding borrowings and the cash collateralization of all outstanding letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of June 30, 2023, we were in compliance with this covenant with a ratio of 26 %. Commercial Paper Program During the second quarter of 2023, we obtained ratings for our commercial paper from Moody s, Standard & Poor and Fitch. Pursuant to our U.S. commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured notes in a maximum aggregate face amount of $ 2.5 billion outstanding at any time, with maturities up to 365 days from the date of issuance. Our $ 2.5 billion U.S. commercial paper program is backed by our $ 2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility and can be used to fund short-term working capital requirements. We did not issue commercial paper during the second quarter of 2023. Debt Redemption In March 2023, we repaid the $ 70 million 8.5 % Senior Notes on the maturity date. Long-term debt At June 30, 2023, we had $ 5.9 billion of total long-term debt outstanding. Long-term debt due within one year consists of $ 131 million of 8.125 % Senior Notes, which were repaid in connection with their maturity on July 17, 2023. Refer to our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a listing of our long-term debt maturities. Debt Remarketing On April 3, 2023, we closed a $ 200 million remarketing to investors of sub-series 2017A-1 bonds that are part of the $ 1 billion St. John the Baptist Parish, State of Louisiana revenue refunding bonds Series 2017. The bonds are subject to an interest rate of 4.05 % and a mandatory purchase date of July 1, 2026. The repayment and new borrowing associated with the remarketed bonds are presented separately within Debt repayments and Borrowings, respectively, within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 19 Table of Contents MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 15. Stockholders Equity Our Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program. During the first six months of 2023, we repurchased approximately 29 million shares of our common stock pursuant to the share repurchase program at a cost of $ 706 million. Our remaining share repurchase authorization was approximately $ 1.8 billion at June 30, 2023. Purchases under the program are made at our discretion and may be in either open market transactions, including block purchases, or in privately negotiated transactions using cash on hand, cash generated from operations or proceeds from potential asset sales. This program may be changed based upon our financial condition or changes in market conditions and is subject to termination prior to completion. Additionally, during the first six months of 2023 we repurchased $ 30 million of shares related to our tax withholding obligation associated with the vesting of employee restricted stock awards and restricted stock units; these repurchases do not impact our share repurchase program authorization. 16. Incentive Based Compensation Stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units The following table presents a summary of activity for the first six months of 2023: Stock Options Restricted Stock & Units Number of Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price Number of Shares & Units Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Outstanding at December 31, 2022 1,678,524 $ 28.86 4,651,196 $ 14.89 Granted $ 1,832,506 $ 25.79 Exercised/Vested ( 10,417 ) $ 10.47 ( 2,597,783 ) $ 11.99 Canceled ( 122,054 ) $ 33.68 ( 116,259 ) $ 20.19 Outstanding at June 30, 2023 1,546,053 $ 28.61 3,769,660 $ 22.02 Stock-based performance unit awards During the first six months of 2023, we granted 222,464 stock-based performance units to eligible officers, which are settled in shares. The grant date fair value per unit was $ 32.97 . During the first six months of 2023, we stock settled the units related to the 2020 grant. At June 30, 2023, there were 686,266 outstanding stock-based performance units to be settled in shares to officers. During the first six months of 2023, we also granted 222,464 stock-based performance units to eligible officers, which are settled in cash. At the grant date for these performance units, each unit represents the value of one share of our common stock. The fair value of each cash-settled performance unit was $ 23.22 as of June 30, 2023. During the first six months of 2023, we also cash settled the units related to the 2021 grant. At June 30, 2023, there were 389,507 units outstanding of the stock-based performance unit awards to be settled in cash to officers. 20 Table of Contents MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 17.

Other noncash investing activities include accrued capital expenditures for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 of $ 169 million and $ 116 million, respectively. 20. Equity Method Investments During the periods ended June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 our equity method investees were considered related parties. Our investment in our equity method investees are summarized in the following table: (In millions) Ownership as of June 30, 2023 June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 EGHoldings (a) 56 % $ 118 $ 287 Alba Plant LLC (b) 52 % 163 155 AMPCO (c) 45 % 149 135 Total $ 430 $ 577 (a) EGHoldings is engaged in LNG production activity. (b) Alba Plant LLC processes LPG. (c) AMPCO is engaged in methanol production activity. Summarized, 100% combined financial information for equity method investees is as follows: Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, (In millions) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Income data: Revenues and other income $ 183 $ 459 $ 489 $ 833 Income from operations 43 306 202 535 Net income $ 30 $ 272 $ 164 $ 476 Revenues from related parties were $ 5 million and $ 11 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and $ 7 million and $ 15 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, with the majority related to EGHoldings in both periods. Cash received from equity investees is classified as dividends or return of capital on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Dividends from equity method investees are reflected in the Operating activities section in Equity Method Investments, net while return of capital is reflected in the Investing activities section. Dividends and return of capital received by us totaled $ 249 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and $ 146 million and $ 200 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively. Current receivables from related parties at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were $ 15 million and $ 36 million, respectively, which primarily related to EGHoldings in both periods. Payables to related parties at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were $ 14 million and $ 20 million, respectively, with the majority related to Alba Plant LLC in both periods. 22 Table of Contents MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 21. Commitments and Contingencies Various groups, including the State of North Dakota and three Indian tribes (the Three Affiliated Tribes ) represented by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, have been involved in a dispute regarding the ownership of certain lands underlying the Missouri River and Little Missouri River (the Disputed Land ) from which we currently produce. As a result, as of June 30, 2023, we have a $ 165 million current liability in suspended royalty and working interest revenue, including interest, of which $ 144 million was included within accounts payable and $ 21 million related to accrued interest and was included within other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, we have a long-term receivable of $ 26 million for capital and expenses. The United States Department of the Interior ( DOI ) has addressed the United States position with respect to this dispute several times in recent years with conflicting opinions. In January 2017, the DOI issued an opinion that the Disputed Land is held in trust for the Three Affiliated Tribes, then in June 2018 and May 2020 the DOI issued opinions concluding that the State of North Dakota held title to the Disputed Land. Most recently, on February 4, 2022, the DOI issued an opinion ( M-Opinion ) concluding the DOI position that the Disputed Land is held in trust for the Three Affiliated Tribes. While the latest M-Opinion is binding on all agencies within the DOI, it is not legally binding on third parties, including Marathon Oil, or a court. Depending on the ultimate outcome of this title dispute, the Three Affiliated Tribes could challenge the validity of certain of our leases relating to a portion of the disputed land, and if such challenge were successful it could result in operational delays and additional costs to us. Given the uncertainty in matters such as these, we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of this matter at this time; however, we believe the resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are a defendant in a number of legal and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business including, but not limited to, royalty claims, contract claims, tax disputes and environmental claims. While the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, we may also be subject to retained liabilities with respect to certain divested assets by operation of law. For example, we are exposed to the risk that owners and/or operators of assets purchased from us become unable to satisfy plugging or abandonment obligations that attach to those assets. In that event, due to operation of law, we may be required to assume plugging or abandonment obligations for those assets. Although we have established reserves for such liabilities, we could be required to accrue additional amounts in the future and these amounts could be material. Marathon Oil was named in a lawsuit alleging improper royalty deductions in certain of our Oklahoma operations, and after plaintiffs lost their attempt to certify a class action, a settlement was reached, and in the first quarter of 2023 such settlement was approved by the court and paid. We have received Notice of Violations ( NOV ) from the EPA related to allegations of violations of the Clean Air Act with respect to our operations on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation between 2015 and 2019. We continue to actively negotiate a draft consent decree with the EPA and Department of Justice containing certain proposed injunctive terms relating to this enforcement action. The resolution of the enforcement action will likely include monetary sanctions and implementation of both environmental mitigation projects and injunctive terms, which would increase both our development costs and operating costs. We maintain an accrual for estimated future costs related to this matter regarding actions required to retrofit or replace existing equipment, which we expect to incur over multiple years. Our accrual does not include possible monetary sanctions or costs associated with mitigation projects as we are currently unable to estimate those amounts. Through the date of this filing, there exists substantial uncertainty as to the ultimate result of this matter and it is reasonably possible the result could be materially different from our expectations and our accrual. The Company received NOV from the EPA relating to alleged Clean Air Act violations following flyovers conducted in 2020 and 2022 over certain of the Company oil and gas facilities in New Mexico. The notices involve alleged emission and permitting violations. We initiated discussions with the EPA to resolve these matters. As we are still investigating these allegations, we are unable to estimate the potential loss associated with these matters, however, it is reasonably possible that resolution of these matters may result in a fine or penalty in excess of $ 300,000 . We have incurred and will continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately offset by the prices we receive for our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes. These laws generally provide for control of pollutants released into the environment and require responsible parties to undertake remediation of hazardous waste disposal sites. Penalties may be imposed for noncompliance. 23 Table of Contents MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) At June 30, 2023, accrued liabilities for remediation relating to environmental laws and regulations were not material. It is not presently possible to estimate the ultimate amount of all remediation cost that might be incurred or the penalties that may be imposed. In the second quarter of 2019, Marathon E.G. Production Limited ( MEGPL ), a consolidated and wholly owned subsidiary, signed a series of agreements to process third-party Alen Unit gas through existing infrastructure located in Punta Europa, E.G. Our equity method investee, Alba Plant LLC, is also a party to some of the agreements. These agreements require (subject to certain limitations) MEGPL to indemnify the owners of the Alen Unit against injury to Alba Plant LLC personnel and damage to or loss of Alba Plant LLC automobiles, as well as third party claims caused by Alba Plant LLC and certain environmental liabilities arising from certain hydrocarbons in the custody of Alba Plant LLC. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate this obligation as we do not have any history of prior indemnification claims or environmental discharge or contamination. Therefore, we have not recorded a liability with respect to these indemnities since the amount of potential future payments under these indemnification clauses is not determinable. The agreements to process the third-party Alen Unit gas required the execution of third-party guarantees by Marathon Oil Corporation in favor of the Alen Unit owners. Two separate guarantees were executed during the second quarter of 2020; one for a maximum of approximately $ 91 million pertaining to the payment obligations of Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A. and another for a maximum of $ 25 million pertaining to the payment obligations of Alba Plant LLC. Payment by us would be required if any of those entities fails to honor its payment obligations pursuant to the relevant agreements with the owners of the Alen Unit. Certain owners of the Alen Unit, or their affiliates, are also direct or indirect shareholders in Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A. and Alba Plant LLC. Each guarantee expires no later than December 31, 2027. We measured these guarantees at fair value using the net present value of premium payments we expect to receive from our investees. Our liability for these guarantees was approximately $ 4 million as of June 30, 2023. Each of Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A. and Equatorial Guinea LNG Train 1, S.A. provided us with a pledge of its receivables as recourse against any payments we may make under the guaranty of Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A. performance. 24 Table of Contents Item 2. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Overview Outlook Operations Market Conditions Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates Cash Flows Liquidity and Capital Resources Environmental Matters and Other Contingencies The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the preceding consolidated financial statements and notes in Item 1 . Executive Overview We are an independent exploration and production company, focused on U.S. resource plays: Eagle Ford in Texas, Bakken in North Dakota, STACK and SCOOP in Oklahoma and Permian in New Mexico and Texas. Our U.S. assets are complemented by our international operations in E.G. Our overall business strategy is to responsibly deliver competitive corporate return levels, free cash flow and cash returns to shareholders, all of which are sustainable and resilient through long-term commodity price cycles. We expect to achieve our business strategy by adherence to a disciplined reinvestment rate capital allocation framework that limits our capital expenditures relative to our expected cash flow from operations. Keeping our workforce safe, maintaining a strong balance sheet, responsibly meeting global energy demand with a focus on continuously improving environmental performance, serving as a trusted partner in our local communities and maintaining best in-class corporate governance standards are foundational to the execution of our strategy. In December 2022, we closed on a transaction to acquire approximately 130,000 net proved and unproved acres, with an average 97% working interest, in the Eagle Ford resource play from Ensign Natural Resources ( Ensign ) for cash consideration of $3.0 billion. Compared to the same period of 2022, we experienced a decrease in revenue and net income from operations and operating cash flow, primarily as a result of lower commodity prices. Total company net sales volumes increased during the second quarter of 2023 when compared to prior year quarter. Below are certain key financial and operational highlights for the quarter: Financial and operational results Our net income was $287 million in the second quarter of 2023 as compared to net income of $966 million in the same period last year. Included in our financial results for the current quarter: Revenues from contracts with customers decreased $684 million compared to the same quarter last year as a result of lower realized commodity prices, partially offset by increased sales. We recorded a net gain of $3 million on commodity derivatives as compared to a net loss of $27 million during the same quarter last year. Income from equity method investments decreased $130 million compared to the same quarter last year as a result of lower realized commodity prices. Depreciation, depletion and amortization was $559 million, which was an increase of $123 million as compared to the same quarter last year. Net sales volumes in the U.S. segment increased 26% compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by increased production from the acreage acquired from Ensign. Prioritized return of capital to investors and maintained investment grade balance sheet In the first six months of 2023, we repurchased $706 million of shares through our share repurchase program. As of June 30, 2023, we have $215 million of cash on hand and $2.3 billion of total liquidity. 25 Table of Contents Paid $125 million of dividends, or $0.20 per share, during the first six months of 2023, compared to dividends paid of $0.15 per share during the first six months of 2022. All three primary credit rating agencies continue to rate us as investment grade, with Fitch and Moody reaffirming our credit rating in June 2023. Outlook Capital Budget In February 2023, we announced a 2023 capital budget of $1.9 billion to $2.0 billion that prioritizes free cash flow generation over production growth, consistent with our disciplined capital allocation framework. Approximately 60% of the 2023 capital budget is weighted to the first half of the year. Operations The following table presents a summary of our sales volumes for each of our segments.

Effective in 2023, the Texas Delaware oil play, which was previously included within Other United States as an exploration property, was integrated into the Permian resource play. The increase in net sales volumes in our U.S. segment compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily a result of our acquisition of the Eagle Ford assets of Ensign in December 2022.

C ommodity prices experienced significant volatility in 2022 and this has continued into 2023. Russia invasion of Ukraine was a geopolitical shock that caused energy prices to spike significantly higher in early to mid-2022. However, Russian oil production has remained at higher levels than expected, European gas shortages were averted as record levels of LNG were imported into that market and an exceptionally warm winter in both the US and Europe has refilled gas inventories to multi year highs causing prices to fall back significantly. Economic headwinds, caused by increasing interest rates as central banks continue to fight inflation, are a threat to demand growth as we move forward. In addition, demand growth in China will continue to have an impact as they emerge from strict COVID restrictions. P rice volatility was also exacerbated by ongoing OPEC+ petroleum supply limitations and economic sanctions involving producer countries. We continue to expect commodity price volatility given the complex global dynamics of supply and demand that exist in the market . Ref e r to Ite m 1A. Risk Factors in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion on how volatility in commodity prices could impact us. 27 Table of Contents United States The following table presents our average price realizations and the related benchmarks for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas for the second quarter and first six months of 2023 and 2022.

Crude oil and condensate Price realizations may differ from benchmarks due to the quality and location of the product. Natural gas liquids The majority of our sales volumes are sold at reference to Mont Belvieu prices. Natural gas A significant portion of our volumes are sold at bid-week prices, or first-of-month indices relative to our producing areas. International (E.G.) The following table presents our average price realizations and the related benchmark for crude oil for the second quarter and first six months of 2023 and 2022.

Crude oil and condensate Alba field liquids production is primarily condensate. We generally sell our share of condensate in relation to the Brent crude benchmark. Alba Plant LLC processes the rich hydrocarbon gas which is supplied by the Alba field under a fixed-price long term contract. Alba Plant LLC extracts NGLs and condensate which is then sold by Alba Plant LLC at market prices, with our share of the revenue reflected in income from equity method investments on the consolidated statements of income. Alba Plant LLC delivers the processed dry natural gas to the Alba Unit Parties for distribution and sale to AMPCO and EG LNG. 28 Table of Contents Natural gas liquids Wet gas is sold to Alba Plant LLC at a fixed-price long term contract resulting in realized prices not tracking market price. Alba Plant LLC extracts and keeps NGLs, which are sold at market price, with our share of income from Alba Plant LLC being reflected in the income from equity method investments on the consolidated statements of income. Natural gas Dry natural gas, processed by Alba Plant LLC on behalf of the Alba Unit Parties, is sold by the Alba field to EG LNG and AMPCO at fixed-price contracts resulting in realized prices not tracking market price. The gas sales contracts between Alba Unit and EG LNG and AMPCO expire on December 31, 2023 and in 2026, respectively. We derive additional value from the equity investment in our downstream gas processing units EG LNG and AMPCO. EG LNG sells LNG on a market-based contract and AMPCO markets methanol at market prices. In March 2023, we announced the signing of a HOA to progress the development of the Equatorial Guinea Regional Gas Mega Hub. The next phase involves processing Alba Unit gas under new contractual terms effective January 1, 2024, that would increase our exposure to global LNG market prices. In addition to processing Alba Unit gas, Alba Plant LLC and EG LNG process third-party gas from the Alen field under a combination of a tolling and a market linked profit-sharing arrangement, the benefits of which are included in our respective share of income from equity method investees. This profit-sharing arrangement provides exposure to global LNG market prices.

Net gain (loss) on commodity derivatives in the second quarter of 2023 was a net gain of $3 million, compared to a net loss of $27 million for the same period in 2022. We have commodity derivative contracts which settle against the NYMEX WTI and Henry Hub indexes. We record commodity derivative gains/losses as the index pricing and forward curves change each period. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Income from equity method investments decreased $130 million in the second quarter of 2023, when compared to the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to lower prices realized by our equity method investees during the second quarter of 2023, as well as lower production as a result of a turnaround at our E.G. facilities completed in April 2023. 29 Table of Contents Production expenses increased $50 million in the second quarter of 2023, when compared to the same period in 2022, primarily as a result of our acquisition of the Eagle Ford assets of Ensign in December 2022 and inflationary pressures when compared to the second quarter of 2022. In addition, in our International segment, production expenses were higher due to the April turnaround. The following table provides production expense and production expense rates (expense per boe) for each segment: Three Months Ended June 30, ($ in millions; rate in $ per boe) 2023 2022 Increase (Decrease) 2023 2022 Increase (Decrease) Production Expense and Rate Expense Rate United States $ 191 $ 150 27 % $ 5.88 $ 5.80 1 % International $ 23 $ 14 64 % $ 5.72 $ 2.83 102 % Shipping, handling and other operating decreased $30 million in the second quarter of 2023 when compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to lower purchases of commodity volumes for resale to satisfy transportation commitments as compared to the prior period. The decrease is partially offset by an increase in third party consultant fees associated with a nonrecurring Eagle Ford severance tax refund during the second quarter of 2023. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $123 million in the second quarter of 2023 primarily as a result of higher production volumes. Our segments apply the units-of-production method to the majority of assets, including capitalized asset retirement costs; therefore, volumes have an impact on DD&A expense. The following table provides DD&A expense and DD&A expense rates for each segment: Three Months Ended June 30, ($ in millions; rate in $ per boe) 2023 2022 Increase (Decrease) 2023 2022 Increase (Decrease) DD&A Expense and Rate Expense Rate United States $ 547 $ 415 32 % $ 16.88 $ 16.11 5 % International $ 10 $ 16 (38) % $ 2.42 $ 2.80 (14) % Taxes other than income include production, severance and ad valorem taxes, primarily in the U.S., which tend to increase or decrease in relation to revenue and sales volumes. Taxes other than income decreased $97 million in the second quarter of 2023 primarily due to a nonrecurring Eagle Ford severance tax refund of $47 million related to prior years and lower sales revenue in the second quarter of 2023, when compared to the same period in 2022. Net interest and other increased $38 million in the second quarter of 2023 primarily as a result of increased interest expense associated with borrowings on our Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Provision for income taxes decreased $201 million in the second quarter of 2023 primarily due to a decrease in income before income taxes for the current quarter when compared to the same period in 2022. 30 Table of Contents Segment Income Segment income represents income that excludes certain items not allocated to our operating segments, net of income taxes. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding items not allocated to the operating segments.

The decrease in segment income is a result of the variances described above. International segment income in the second quarter of 2023 was $30 million of income versus $160 million of income for the same period in 2022. The decrease was primarily due to lower price realizations and lower net sales volume by our equity method investees. Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes in the second quarter of 2023 was a loss of $108 million versus a loss of $40 million for the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily due to unrealized net losses on commodity derivatives in the second quarter of 2023 versus unrealized net gains on commodity derivatives in the same period of 2022, as well higher interest expense as a result of outstanding borrowings on our Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility.

Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $220 million in the first six months of 2023 primarily as a result of higher production volumes. Our segments apply the units-of-production method to the majority of their assets, including capitalized asset retirement costs; therefore volumes have an impact on DD&A expense. The following table provides DD&A expense and DD&A expense rates for each segment: 32 Table of Contents Six Months Ended June 30, ($ in millions; rate in $ per boe) 2023 2022 Increase (Decrease) 2023 2022 Increase (Decrease) DD&A Expense and Rate Expense Rate United States $ 1,052 $ 819 28 % $ 16.68 $ 16.06 4 % International $ 22 $ 31 (29) % $ 2.41 $ 2.80 (14) % Net interest and other increased $98 million in the first six months of 2023 primarily as a result of increased interest expense associated with borrowings on our Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility. Taxes other than income include production, severance and ad valorem taxes, primarily in the U.S., which tend to increase or decrease in relation to revenue and sales volumes. Taxes other than income decreased $106 million primarily due to lower sales revenue in the first six months of 2023, as well as a nonrecurring Eagle Ford severance tax refund of $47 million related to prior years in the second quarter of 2023. Provision (benefit) for income taxes reflects an effective income tax rate of 21% in the first six months of 2023. The tax benefit for income taxes in the first six months of 2022 included a non-cash tax benefit of $685 million arising from the partial release of a valuation allowance on certain U.S. and state deferred tax assets. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Segment Income Segment income represents income that excludes certain items not allocated to our operating segments, net of income taxes. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding items not allocated to the operating segments. The following table reconciles segment income to net income: Six Months Ended June 30, (In millions) 2023 2022 United States $ 790 $ 1,507 International 119 275 Segment income 909 1,782 Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes (205) 488 Net income $ 704 $ 2,270 United States segment income for the first six months of 2023 was $790 million of income versus a $1.5 billion of income for the same period in 2022. The decrease in segment income is a result of the variances described above. International segment income for the first six months of 2023 was $119 million of income versus $275 million of income for the same period in 2022. The decrease was primarily due to lower prices realized by our equity method investees. Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes for the first six months of 2023 was $205 million of loss versus $488 million of income for the same period in 2022. The change from income to loss was primarily due to the partial release of a valuation allowance on certain U.S. and state deferred tax assets in the first six months of 2022, which resulted in a non-cash deferred tax benefit of $685 million. In addition, we had increased interest expense as a result of outstanding borrowings on our Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility, partially offset by a decrease in unrealized net losses on commodity derivatives in the first six months of 2023. Critical Accounting Estimates There have been no material changes or developments in the evaluation of the accounting estimates and the underlying assumptions or methodologies pertaining to our Critical Accounting Estimates disclosed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. 33 Table of Contents Cash Flows The following table presents sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents: Six Months Ended June 30, (In millions) 2023 2022 Sources of cash and cash equivalents Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,941 $ 2,745 Proceeds from revolving credit facility 980 Borrowings (a) 200 Equity method investments - return of capital 34 7 Other 9 30 Total sources of cash and cash equivalents $ 3,164 $ 2,782 Uses of cash and cash equivalents Additions to property, plant and equipment $ (1,166) $ (687) Repayments of revolving credit facility (980) Debt repayment (a) (270) (32) Shares repurchased under buyback programs (706) (1,352) Dividends paid (125) (108) Purchases of shares for tax withholding obligations (30) (21) Other (6) Total uses of cash and cash equivalents $ (3,283) $ (2,200) (a) Includes repayment and new borrowing associated with April 2023 remarketing to investors of $200 million sub-series 2017A-1 bonds. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Sources of cash and cash equivalents Cash flows generated from operating activities during the second quarter of 2023 were 29% lower compared to 2022, primarily as a result of lower realized commodity prices, partially offset by higher volumes resulting from our acquisition of the Eagle Ford assets of Ensign in December 2022. During the first six months of 2023, we borrowed and repaid $980 million under our Revolving Credit Facility. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below for further information. Uses of cash and cash equivalents During the first six months of 2023, we repurchased approximately 29 million shares of our common stock pursuant to the share repurchase program at a cost of $706 million, paid dividends of $125 million and repaid the $70 million 8.5% Senior Notes on the maturity date. Additionally, we repurchased $30 million of shares during the first six months of 2023 related to our tax withholding obligations associated with the vesting of employee restricted stock awards and restricted stock units; these repurchases do not impact our share repurchase program authorization. The following table shows capital expenditures by segment and reconciles to additions to property, plant and equipment as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows: Six Months Ended June 30, (In millions) 2023 2022 United States $ 1,217 $ 718 International 2 Not Allocated to Segments (Corporate) 5 5 Total capital expenditures (accrued) 1,224 723 Change in capital expenditure accrual (58) (36) Total use of cash and cash equivalents for property, plant and equipment $ 1,166 $ 687 34 Table of Contents The increase in our capital expenditures for the U.S. segment in the first six months of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was largely driven by increased investment and drilling related to the Eagle Ford acreage we acquired from Ensign in December 2022. Additionally, inflationary pressures related to oil field services, labor, drilling materials and equipment, as well as timing of capital spend and increased activities in the first six months of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, contributed to the increase in capital expenditures. Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources and Available Liquidity Our main sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, internally generated cash flow from operations, capital market transactions and our Revolving Credit Facility. During the second quarter of 2023, we obtained ratings for our commercial paper from Moody s, Standard & Poor and Fitch. Pursuant to our U.S. commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured notes in a maximum aggregate face amount of $2.5 billion outstanding at any time, with maturities up to 365 days from the date of issuance. Our $2.5 billion U.S. commercial paper program is backed by our $2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility and can be used to fund short-term working capital requirements. We did not issue commercial paper during the second quarter of 2023. At June 30, 2023, we had approximately $2.3 billion of liquidity consisting of $215 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2.1 billion available under our Revolving Credit Facility. Our working capital requirements are supported by our cash and cash equivalents, U.S. commercial paper program and our Revolving Credit Facility. We may issue commercial paper, draw on our Revolving Credit Facility to meet short-term cash requirements or issue debt or equity securities through the shelf registration statement discussed below as part of our longer-term liquidity and capital management program. Because of the alternatives available to us as discussed above, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity are adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements including our capital spending programs, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities, dividends and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies. See Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of how our commitments and contingencies could affect our available liquidity. General economic conditions, commodity prices, and financial, business and other factors could affect our operations and our ability to access the capital markets. We maintain investment grade ratings at all three primary credit rating agencies. A downgrade in our credit ratings could increase our future cost of financing or limit our ability to access capital and could result in additional credit support requirements. We do not have any triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an event of default in the case of a downgrade of our credit ratings. See Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 for a discussion of how a downgrade in our credit ratings could affect us. We may incur additional debt in order to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, acquisitions or development activities or for general corporate or other purposes. A higher level of indebtedness could increase the risk that our liquidity and financial flexibility deteriorates. See Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 for a further discussion of how our level of indebtedness could affect us. Credit Arrangements and Borrowings In November 2022, we entered into a two-year $1.5 billion Term Loan Facility and borrowed the full amount thereunder in December 2022. The Term Loan Facility can be prepaid without penalty. As of June 30, 2023, we had net borrowings of $450 million against our $2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility and $5.9 billion of total long-term debt outstanding. Long-term debt due within one year consists of $131 million of 8.125% Senior Notes, which were repaid in connection with their maturity on July 17, 2023. Both our Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility include a covenant requiring that our total debt to total capitalization ratio not exceed 65% as of the last day of the fiscal quarter. Our total debt-to-capital ratio was 26% at both June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Refer to our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a listing of our long-term debt maturities. On April 3, 2023, we closed a $200 million remarketing to investors of sub-series 2017A-1 bonds that are part of the $1 billion St. John the Baptist, State of Louisiana revenue refunding bonds Series 2017. The bonds are subject to an interest rate of 4.05% and a mandatory purchase date of July 1, 2026. Other sources of liquidity We have an effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC pursuant to which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer for purposes of SEC rules, subject to market conditions, are permitted to issue and sell an indeterminate 35 Table of Contents amount of various types of debt, equity securities and other capital instruments, if and when necessary or perceived by us to be opportune, in one or more public offerings. Capital Requirements Share Repurchase Program Our Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program. Our remaining authorization at June 30, 2023 was approximately $1.8 billion. Dividends On July 26, 2023, our Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.10 per share payable September 11, 2023 to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 16, 2023. Income Taxes As described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the IRA was signed into law during 2022. Under current law and guidance, we do not anticipate being subject to the corporate book minimum tax in 2023. The U.S. Treasury is expected to publish further guidance and regulations that will be relevant to scoping considerations and the calculation of minimum income tax liabilities. As this guidance is issued, we will continue to evaluate and assess the impact the IRA may have on our current and future period income taxes. If we conclude that we do trigger the minimum income tax, we may have to make estimated tax payments. Other Contractual Cash Obligations As of June 30, 2023, there are no material changes to our consolidated cash obligations to make future payments under existing contracts, as disclosed in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Environmental Matters and Other Contingencies We have incurred and will continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately offset by the prices we receive for our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes. These laws generally provide for control of pollutants released into the environment and require responsible parties to undertake remediation of hazardous waste disposal sites. Penalties may be imposed for noncompliance. Other than the items set forth in Part II - Item 1. Legal Proceedings , there have been no significant changes to the environmental, health and safety matters under Item 1. Business or Item 3. Legal Proceedings in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of other contingencies.
