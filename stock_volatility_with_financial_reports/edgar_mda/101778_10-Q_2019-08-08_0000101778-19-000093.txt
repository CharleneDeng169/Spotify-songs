Basis of Presentation These consolidated financial statements are unaudited; however, in the opinion of management, these statements reflect all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the periods reported. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature unless disclosed otherwise. These consolidated financial statements, including notes, have been prepared in accordance with the applicable rules of the SEC and do not include all of the information and disclosures required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The results of operations for the second quarter and first six months of 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. As a result of the announcement to sell our U.K. business in the first quarter of 2019 , we have reflected these assets and liabilities as held for sale at June 30, 2019 in the consolidated balance sheet and the consolidated statement of cash flows. The related disclosures in this report exclude these held for sale amounts, unless otherwise noted. This divestiture is discussed in further detail in Note 4 . Reclassifications We have reclassified certain prior year amounts within operating cash flow to present it on a basis comparable with the current year presentation with no impact on net cash provided by operating activities. 2 . Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted Financial instruments credit losses In June 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standards update that changes the impairment model for trade receivables, net investments in leases, debt securities, loans and certain other instruments. The standard requires the use of a forward-looking expected loss model as opposed to the current incurred loss model. This standard is effective for us in the first quarter of 2020 and will be adopted on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the adoption period. Early adoption is permitted starting January 2019. We are evaluating the provisions of this accounting standards update and assessing the impact, if any, it may have on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Recently Adopted Lease accounting standard In February 2016, the FASB issued a new leasing accounting standard, which modified the definition of a lease and established comprehensive accounting and financial reporting requirements for leasing arrangements. It requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use ( ROU ) asset for all leases, including operating leases, with a term of greater than 12 months on the balance sheet. On January 1, 2019, we adopted the new lease accounting standard using the modified retrospective method and applied to all leases that existed as of that date. It does not apply to leases to explore for or use minerals, oil, natural gas and similar non-regenerative resources, including the intangible right to explore for those natural resources and rights to use the land in which those natural resources are contained. The new lease standard requires certain accounting policy decisions while also providing a number of optional practical expedients for transition accounting. Our accounting policies and the practical expedients utilized are summarized below: Implemented an accounting policy to not recognize any right-of-use assets and lease liabilities related to short-term leases on the balance sheet. Implemented an accounting policy to not separate the lease and nonlease components for all asset classes, except for vessels. Elected the package of practical expedients which allows us to not reassess our prior conclusions regarding the lease identification and lease classification for contracts that commenced or expired prior to the effective date. 7 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Elected the practical expedient pertaining to land easements which allows us to continue accounting for existing agreements under the previous accounting policies as nonlease transactions. Any modifications of existing contracts or new agreements will be assessed under the new lease accounting guidance and may become leases in the future. As a result of the adoption, we recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment to stockholders equity on the date of adoption of $ 31 million . We continue presenting all prior comparative periods without any restatements. Hedge accounting standard In August 2017, the FASB issued a new accounting standards update that amends the hedge accounting model to enable entities to hedge certain financial and nonfinancial risk attributes previously not allowed. The amendment also reduces the overall complexity of documenting, assessing and measuring hedge effectiveness. This standard was effective for us in the first quarter of 2019. Adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 3 . Income and Dividends per Common Share Basic income per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted income per share assumes exercise of stock options in all periods, provided the effect is not antidilutive. The per share calculations below exclude 6 million of stock options for each of the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 6 million and 8 million of stock options for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 , respectively, that were antidilutive. Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, (In millions, except per share data) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Net income $ 161 $ 96 $ 335 $ 452 Weighted average common shares outstanding 813 854 817 853 Effect of dilutive securities 1 1 1 Weighted average common shares, diluted 814 855 817 854 Net income per share: Basic $ 0.20 $ 0.11 $ 0.41 $ 0.53 Diluted $ 0.20 $ 0.11 $ 0.41 $ 0.53 Dividends per share $ 0.05 $ 0.05 $ 0.10 $ 0.10 4 . Dispositions United States Segment In the second quarter of 2019, we entered into agreements to sell non-core, proved properties and classified these transactions as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2019 , with total assets of $ 26 million and total liabilities of $ 7 million . In the second quarter of 2018, we entered into separate agreements to sell non-core, non-operated conventional properties, primarily in the Gulf of Mexico. These transactions closed during the third quarter of 2018. International Segment In July 2019, we closed on the sale of our U.K. business (Marathon Oil U.K. LLC and Marathon Oil West of Shetlands Limited), which resulted in proceeds of approximately $ 95 million and reflects the assumption by RockRose Energy PLC (the buyer) of the U.K. business working capital and cash equivalent balances of approximately $ 345 million on December 31, 2018 . The transaction has an effective date of January 1, 2019. 8 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Our U.K. business was classified as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets at June 30, 2019 , with total assets of $ 1,049 million (including $ 125 million in cash restricted by escrow agreement terms with the balance transferring to buyer upon close) and total liabilities of $ 1,046 million , including asset retirement obligations of $ 966 million . For the second quarter of 2019 and 2018 , we had approximately $ 22 million and $ 48 million , in income before income taxes relating to our U.K business. For the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 , we had approximately $ 37 million and $ 107 million , in income before income taxes relating to our U.K business. In the second quarter of 2019, we closed on the sale of our 15 % non-operated interest in the Atrush block in Kurdistan for proceeds of $ 63 million , before closing adjustments. This property was classified as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2018 , with total assets of $ 58 million and total liabilities of $ 17 million . In the first quarter of 2018, we closed on the sale of our subsidiary, Marathon Oil Libya Limited, which held our 16.33 % non-operated interest in the Waha concessions in Libya, to a subsidiary of Total S.A. (Elf Aquitaine SAS) for proceeds of approximately $ 450 million , excluding closing adjustments, and recognized a pre-tax gain of $ 255 million . 5 . Revenues The majority of our revenues are derived from the sale of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas under spot and term agreements with our customers in the United States and various international locations. The following tables present our revenues from contracts with customers disaggregated by product type and geographic areas.

(In millions) June 30, 2019 January 1, 2019 Receivables from contracts with customers, included in receivables, less reserves $ 797 $ 714 Contract asset (liability) $ 21 $ ( 1 ) The contract liability primarily relates to the advance consideration received from customers for crude oil sales and processing services in the U.K. A contract asset would represent crude oil delivered in the U.K. to a customer for which payment will be collected over time as it becomes due under the pricing terms stipulated in the sales agreement. As a practical expedient, when the balance of this U.K. customer is a contract asset, we do not adjust revenue for the effects of a significant financing element as the period between when crude oil is delivered to the customer and when payment is expected to be received is one year or less at contract inception. Changes in the contract asset (liability) balance during the period are as follows. Six Months Ended (In millions) June 30, 2019 Contract asset (liability) balance as of January 1, 2019 $ ( 1 ) Revenue recognized as performance obligations are satisfied 74 Amounts invoiced to customers ( 52 ) Contract asset (liability) balance as of June 30, 2019 $ 21 6 . Segment Information We have two reportable operating segments. Both of these segments are organized and managed based upon geographic location and the nature of the products and services offered. United States ( U.S. ) explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas in the United States International ( Int l ) explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas outside of the United States and produces and markets products manufactured from natural gas, such as LNG and methanol, in Equatorial Guinea ( E.G. ) Information regarding assets by segment is not presented because it is not reviewed by the chief operating decision maker ( CODM ). Segment income represents income which excludes certain items not allocated to our operating segments, net of income taxes. A portion of our corporate and operations general and administrative support costs are not allocated to the operating segments. These unallocated costs primarily consist of employment costs (including pension effects), professional services, facilities and other costs associated with corporate and operations support activities. Additionally, items which affect comparability such as: gains or losses on dispositions, proved property impairments, unrealized gains or losses on commodity derivative instruments, pension settlement losses or other items (as determined by the CODM) are not allocated to operating segments. 11 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Three Months Ended June 30, 2019 Not Allocated (In millions) U.S. Int l to Segments Total Revenues from contracts with customers $ 1,200 $ 181 $ $ 1,381 Net gain on commodity derivatives 5 11 (b) 16 Income from equity method investments 31 31 Net loss on disposal of assets ( 8 ) (c) ( 8 ) Other income 4 2 7 13 Less costs and expenses: Production 147 46 193 Shipping, handling and other operating 147 10 13 170 Exploration 26 26 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 561 38 6 605 Impairments 18 (d) 18 Taxes other than income 79 79 General and administrative 31 8 48 87 Net interest and other 64 64 Other net periodic benefit costs ( 1 ) ( 1 ) ( 2 ) Income tax provision (benefit) 3 17 12 32 Segment income $ 215 $ 96 $ ( 150 ) $ 161 Capital expenditures (a) $ 686 $ 10 $ 5 $ 701 (a) Includes accruals.

Income Taxes Effective Tax Rate The effective income tax rate is influenced by a variety of factors including the geographic and functional sources of income and the relative magnitude of these sources of income. The difference between the total provision and the sum of the amounts allocated to segments is reported in the Not Allocated to Segments column of the tables in Note 6 . For the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 , our effective income tax rates were as follows: Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Effective income tax expense (benefit) rate (a) 17 % 31 % ( 52 )% 32 % (a) In all periods presented, we maintained our valuation allowance on our net federal deferred tax assets in the U.S. The following items caused the effective income tax rates to be different from our U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% for 2019 and 2018 : Income taxes for the second quarter of 2019 were impacted by pre-tax income and foreign currency revaluation. Income taxes for the six months ended June 30, 2019 were impacted by the settlement of the 2010-2011 U.S. Federal Tax Audit ( IRS Audit ) in the first quarter of 2019, resulting in a tax benefit of $ 126 million . Additionally, in the first quarter of 2019, we recorded a non-cash deferred tax benefit of $ 18 million in the U.K. related to an internal restructuring. These two items are discrete to the first six months of 2019 . Excluding these discrete adjustments, the effective income tax rate for the first six months of 2019 was an expense of 13 % . Income taxes for the second quarter of 2018 were impacted by foreign currency revaluation. During the six months ended June 30, 2018 , income taxes were impacted by the tax expense in Libya of $ 162 million . As a result of the IRS Audit settlement in the first quarter of 2019, the uncertain tax positions previously established are now effectively settled. The release of the accrued uncertain tax positions resulted in a $ 126 million tax benefit, primarily related to the additional alternative minimum tax ( AMT ) credits, see Note 22 for further detail. Pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement we entered into with Marathon Petroleum Corporation ( MPC ) in connection with the 2011 spin-off transaction, MPC agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. In addition to the benefit from the settlement of the IRS Audit in the first quarter of 2019, we recorded a current receivable and other income of $ 42 million for indemnity payments due from MPC for tax expense and interest we had previously recognized. The indemnity relates to tax and interest allocable to MPC as a result of the IRS Audit. During the second quarter of 2019, we paid the IRS and were subsequently reimbursed by MPC for settlement of their indemnity obligation. During the first quarter of 2019, we withdrew our appeal related to the Brae area decommissioning costs in the U.K., thus the uncertain tax positions previously established are now considered effectively settled with no tax expense or benefit impact. 8 . Inventories Crude oil and natural gas are recorded at weighted average cost and carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Supplies and other items consist principally of tubular goods and equipment which are valued at weighted average cost and reviewed periodically for obsolescence or impairment when market conditions indicate. (In millions) June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Crude oil and natural gas $ 9 $ 11 Supplies and other items 63 85 Inventories $ 72 $ 96 16 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 9 .

Impairments The following table summarizes impairment charges of proved properties. Additionally, it presents the values of assets, by major category, measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in periods subsequent to their initial recognition. Three Months Ended June 30, 2019 2018 (In millions) Fair Value Impairment Fair Value Impairment Long-lived assets held for use $ 19 $ 18 $ 69 $ 34 Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 2018 (In millions) Fair Value Impairment Fair Value Impairment Long-lived assets held for use $ 56 $ 24 $ 69 $ 42 2019 During the six months ended June 30, 2019 , we recorded pre-tax non-cash proved property impairments of $ 24 million , primarily as a result of anticipated sales proceeds for certain non-core proved properties in our United States segment and the sale of our non-operated interest in the Atrush block (Kurdistan) in our International segment. The related fair value was measured using the market approach, based upon anticipated sales proceeds less costs to sell which resulted in a Level 2 classification. See Note 4 for discussion of the divestiture in further detail. 2018 During the six months ended June 30, 2018 , we recorded pre-tax non-cash proved property impairments of $ 42 million , to a fair value of $ 69 million , primarily as a result of anticipated sales proceeds for certain non-core proved properties in our International and United States segments. The related fair value measurement utilized the market approach, based upon anticipated sales proceeds less costs to sell which resulted in a Level 2 classification. See Note 4 for discussion of the divestiture in further detail. 17 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 11 . Asset Retirement Obligations Asset retirement obligations primarily consist of estimated costs to remove, dismantle and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations. Changes in asset retirement obligations for the six months ended were as follows: June 30, (In millions) 2019 2018 Beginning balance $ 1,145 $ 1,483 Incurred liabilities, including acquisitions 18 8 Settled liabilities, including dispositions ( 129 ) ( 14 ) Accretion expense (included in depreciation, depletion and amortization) 26 36 Revisions of estimates 11 ( 9 ) Held for sale ( 864 ) ( 89 ) Ending balance $ 207 $ 1,415 June 30, 2019 Settled liabilities are primarily related to the sale of our working interest in the Droshky field (Gulf of Mexico), which closed during the first quarter of 2019. Held for sale includes the asset retirement obligations of $ 966 million associated with the sale of our U.K. business, which was partially offset by settled liabilities for dispositions primarily related to the Droshky field in the first quarter of 2019. See Note 4 for discussion of the divestitures in further detail. Ending balance includes $ 18 million classified as short-term at June 30, 2019 . June 30, 2018 Held for sale includes the asset retirement obligations associated with the sale of non-core, non-operated conventional properties, primarily in the Gulf of Mexico. See Note 4 for discussion of the divestitures in further detail. Ending balance includes $ 51 million classified as short-term at June 30, 2018 . 12 . Leases Supplemental balance sheet information related to leases was as follows: (In millions) June 30, 2019 Operating Leases: Balance Sheet Location: ROU asset Other noncurrent assets $ 248 Current portion of long-term lease liability Other current liabilities $ 104 Long-term lease liability Deferred credits and other liabilities $ 151 In determining our ROU assets and long-term lease liabilities, the new lease standard requires certain accounting policy decisions, while also providing a number of optional practical expedients for transition accounting. Our accounting policies and the practical expedients utilized are summarized below: Implemented an accounting policy to not recognize any right-of-use assets and lease liabilities related to short-term leases on the balance sheet. Implemented an accounting policy to not separate the lease and nonlease components for all asset classes, except for vessels. Elected the package of practical expedients which allows us to not reassess our prior conclusions regarding the lease identification and lease classification for contracts that commenced or expired prior to the effective date. Elected the practical expedient pertaining to land easements which allows us to continue accounting for existing agreements under the previous accounting policies as nonlease transactions. Any modifications of existing contracts or new agreements will be assessed under the new lease accounting guidance and may become leases in the future. 18 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) We enter into various lease agreements to support our operations including drilling rigs, well fracturing equipment, compressors, buildings, aircraft, vessels, vehicles and miscellaneous field equipment. We primarily act as a lessee in these transactions and all of our existing leases are classified as either short-term or long-term operating leases. The majority of the drilling rig agreements and all of fracturing equipment agreements are classified as short-term leases based on the noncancellable period for which we have the right to use the equipment and assessment of options present in each agreement. We also incur variable lease costs under these agreements primarily related to chemicals and sand used in fracturing operations or various additional on-demand equipment and labor. The lease costs associated with the drilling rigs and fracturing equipment are primarily capitalized as part of the well costs. Our long-term leases are comprised of compressors, buildings, drilling rigs, aircraft, vessels, vehicles and miscellaneous field equipment. Our lease agreements may require both fixed and variable payments; none of the variable payments are rate or index-based, therefore only fixed payments were considered for recognizing lease liabilities and ROU assets related to long-term leases. Also, based on our election not to separate the lease and nonlease components, fixed payments related to equipment, crew and other nonlease components are included in the initial measurement of lease liabilities and ROU assets for all asset classes, except for vessels. For vessels, the contractual consideration was allocated between lease and nonlease components based on estimates provided by service providers. Our leased assets may be used in joint oil and gas operations with other working interest owners. We recognize lease liabilities and ROU assets only when we are the signatory to a contract as an operator of joint properties. Such lease liabilities and ROU assets are determined based on gross contractual obligations. As we use the leased assets for joint operations, we have the contractual right to recover the other working interest owners share of lease costs. As a result, our lease costs are presented on a net basis, reduced for any costs recoverable from other working interest owners. The table below presents our net lease costs as of June 30, 2019 with the majority of operating lease costs expensed as incurred, while the majority of the short-term and variable term lease costs are capitalized into property, plant and equipment. (In millions) Three Months Ended June 30, 2019 Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 Lease costs: Operating lease costs (a) $ 19 $ 40 Short-term lease costs (b) 76 157 Variable lease costs (c) 12 72 Total lease costs $ 107 $ 269 Other information: Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities $ 27 ROU assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities (d) $ 293 (a) Represents our net share of the ROU asset amortization and the interest expense. (b) Represents our net share of lease costs arising from leases of less than one year but longer than one month that were not included in the lease liability. (c) Represents our net share of variable lease payments that were not included in the lease liability. (d) Represents the cumulative value of ROU assets recognized at lease inception during the first six months of 2019 . This amount is then amortized as we utilize the ROU asset, the net effect of which is the ending ROU asset of $ 248 million (first table above). 19 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) We use our periodic incremental borrowing rate to discount future contractual payments to their present values. The weighted average lease term and the discount rate relevant to long-term leases were three years and 4 % as of June 30, 2019 . The remaining annual undiscounted cash flows associated with long-term leases and the reconciliation of these cash flows to the lease liabilities recognized on the consolidated balance sheet is summarized below. (In millions) Operating Lease Obligations 2019 $ 61 2020 106 2021 62 2022 35 2023 5 Thereafter 1 Total undiscounted lease payments $ 270 Less: amount representing interest 15 Total operating lease liabilities $ 255 Less: current portion of long-term lease liability as of June 30, 2019 104 Long-term lease liability as of June 30, 2019 $ 151 At December 31, 2018 , future minimum commitments under the previous accounting standard, ASC 840, for operating lease obligations having noncancellable lease terms in excess of one year were as follows: (In millions) Operating Lease Obligations 2019 $ 62 2020 54 2021 35 2022 12 2023 5 Thereafter 49 Sublease rentals Total minimum lease payments $ 217 * Future minimum commitments for capital lease obligations were nil as of December 31, 2018 . Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Marathon E.G. Production Limited, is a lessor for residential housing in Equatorial Guinea, which is occupied by EGHoldings, a related party equity method investee see Note 21 . The lease was classified as an operating lease and expires in 2024, with a lessee option to extend through 2034. Lease payments are fixed for the entire duration of the agreement at approximately $ 6 million per year. Our lease income is reported in other income in our consolidated statements of income for all periods presented. The undiscounted cash flows to be received under this lease agreement are summarized below. (In millions) Operating Lease Future Cash Receipts 2019 $ 4 2020 6 2021 6 2022 6 2023 6 Thereafter 66 Total undiscounted cash flows $ 94 20 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) In 2018, we signed an agreement with an owner/lessor to construct and lease a new build-to-suit office building in Houston, Texas. The new Houston office location is expected to be completed in 2021. The lessor and other participants are providing financing for up to $ 380 million , to fund the estimated project costs. As of June 30, 2019 , project costs incurred totaled approximately $ 50 million , primarily for land acquisition and initial design costs. The initial lease term is five years and will commence once construction is substantially complete and the new Houston office is ready for occupancy. At the end of the initial lease term, we can negotiate to extend the lease term for an additional five years , subject to the approval of the participants; purchase the property subject to certain terms and conditions; or remarket the property to an unrelated third party. The lease contains a residual value guarantee of approximately 89 % of the total acquisition and construction costs. 13 . Derivatives For further information regarding the fair value measurement of derivative instruments see Note 14 . All of our commodity derivatives are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements under which we report net amounts. The following tables present the gross fair values of derivative instruments and the reported net amounts along with where they appear on the consolidated balance sheets.

These derivatives consist of three-way collars, basis swaps and NYMEX roll basis swaps. Three-way collars consist of a sold call (ceiling), a purchased put (floor) and a sold put. The ceiling price is the maximum we will receive for the contract volumes; the floor is the minimum price we will receive, unless the market price falls below the sold put strike price. In this case, we receive the NYMEX WTI price plus the difference between the floor and the sold put price. These commodity derivatives were not designated as hedges. The following table sets forth outstanding derivative contracts as of June 30, 2019 , and the weighted average prices for those contracts: 2019 2020 2021 Crude Oil Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Full Year Full Year NYMEX WTI Three-Way Collars (a) Volume (Bbls/day) 80,000 80,000 9,945 Weighted average price per Bbl: Ceiling $ 74.19 $ 74.19 $ 70.00 $ Floor $ 56.75 $ 56.75 $ 55.00 $ Sold put $ 49.50 $ 49.50 $ 47.00 $ Basis Swaps - Argus WTI Midland (b) Volume (Bbls/day) 15,000 15,000 15,000 Weighted average price per Bbl $ ( 1.40 ) $ ( 1.40 ) $ ( 0.94 ) $ Basis Swaps - Net Energy Clearbrook (c) Volume (Bbls/day) 1,000 1,000 Weighted average price per Bbl $ ( 3.50 ) $ ( 3.50 ) $ $ Basis Swaps - NYMEX WTI / ICE Brent (d) Volume (Bbls/day) 5,000 5,000 5,000 808 Weighted average price per Bbl $ ( 7.24 ) $ ( 7.24 ) $ ( 7.24 ) $ ( 7.24 ) Basis Swaps - Argus WTI Houston (e) Volume (Bbls/day) 10,000 10,000 Weighted average price per Bbl $ 5.51 $ 5.51 $ $ NYMEX Roll Basis Swaps Volume (Bbls/day) 60,000 60,000 Weighted average price per Bbl $ 0.38 $ 0.38 $ $ (a) Between July 1, 2019 and August 5, 2019 , we entered into 10,000 Bbls/day of three-way collars for January - December 2020, with a ceiling of $ 65.12 , a sold put of $ 48.00 , and a floor of $ 55.00 . (b) The basis differential price is indexed against Argus WTI Midland. (c) The basis differential price is indexed against Net Energy Canada Bakken SW at Clearbrook ( UHC ). (d) The basis differential price is indexed against International Commodity Exchange ( ICE ) Brent and NYMEX WTI. (e) The basis differential price is indexed against Argus WTI Houston. The mark-to-market impact and settlement of these commodity derivative instruments appears in net gain (loss) on commodity derivatives in our consolidated statements of income. The mark-to-market impact for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 was a gain of $ 11 million and a loss of $ 102 million compared to a loss of $ 45 million and a loss of $ 88 million for the same respective periods in 2018 . Net settlements of commodity derivative instruments for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 was a gain of $ 5 million and a gain of $ 27 million compared to a loss of $ 107 million and a loss of $ 166 million for the same respective periods in 2018 . 22 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 14 . Fair Value Measurements Fair Values Recurring The following tables present assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 by hierarchy level. June 30, 2019 (In millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Derivative instruments, assets Commodity (a) $ $ 30 $ $ 30 Derivative instruments, assets $ $ 30 $ $ 30 Derivative instruments, liabilities Commodity (a) $ ( 5 ) $ $ $ ( 5 ) Derivative instruments, liabilities $ ( 5 ) $ $ $ ( 5 ) (a) Derivative instruments are recorded on a net basis in our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 13 . December 31, 2018 (In millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Derivative instruments, assets Commodity (a) $ 21 $ 106 $ $ 127 Derivative instruments, assets $ 21 $ 106 $ $ 127 Derivative instruments, liabilities Derivative instruments, liabilities $ $ $ $ (a) Derivative instruments are recorded on a net basis in our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 13 . Commodity derivatives include three-way collars, basis swaps and NYMEX roll basis swaps. These instruments are measured at fair value using either a Black-Scholes or a modified Black-Scholes Model. For basis swaps and NYMEX roll basis swaps, inputs to the models include only commodity prices and interest rates and are categorized as Level 1 because all assumptions and inputs are observable in active markets throughout the term of the instruments. For three-way collars, inputs to the models include commodity prices, and implied volatility and are categorized as Level 2 because predominantly all assumptions and inputs are observable in active markets throughout the term of the instruments. Fair Value Estimates - Goodwill As of June 30, 2019 , our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of $ 95 million . Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or between annual tests when events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value may have been reduced below its carrying value. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. Our reporting units are the same as our reporting segments, of which only the International reporting unit includes goodwill. Our policy is to first assess the qualitative factors in order to determine whether the fair value of our International reporting unit is more likely than not less than its carrying amount. Certain qualitative factors used in our evaluation include, among other things, the results of the most recent quantitative assessment of goodwill (second quarter of 2017); macroeconomic conditions; industry and market conditions (including commodity prices and cost factors); overall financial performance; and other relevant entity-specific events. If, after considering these events and circumstances we determine that it is more likely than not the fair value of the International reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative goodwill test is performed. During the second quarter of 2019 , we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill using the qualitative assessment. Our qualitative assessment considered the significant excess fair value over carrying value in our most recent step one test and noted there are more positive/neutral indicators than negative. After assessing the totality of these qualitative factors, our assessment did not indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value. As a result, we concluded that no impairment to goodwill was required for our International reporting unit. Fair Values Nonrecurring See Note 4 and Note 10 for detail on our fair values for nonrecurring items, such as impairments. 23 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Fair Values Financial Instruments Our current assets and liabilities include financial instruments, the most significant of which are receivables, the current portion of our long-term debt and payables. We believe the carrying values of our receivables and payables approximate fair value. Our fair value assessment incorporates a variety of considerations, including (1) the short-term duration of the instruments, (2) our credit rating and (3) our historical incurrence of and expected future insignificant bad debt expense, which includes an evaluation of counterparty credit risk. The following table summarizes financial instruments, excluding receivables, payables and derivative financial instruments, and their reported fair values by individual balance sheet line item at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 (In millions) Fair Value Carrying Amount Fair Value Carrying Amount Financial assets Current assets $ 4 $ 4 $ 3 $ 3 Other noncurrent assets 25 31 76 81 Total financial assets $ 29 $ 35 $ 79 $ 84 Financial liabilities Other current liabilities $ 76 $ 101 $ 37 $ 58 Long-term debt, including current portion (a) 6,048 5,528 5,469 5,528 Deferred credits and other liabilities 109 98 93 88 Total financial liabilities $ 6,233 $ 5,727 $ 5,599 $ 5,674 (a) Excludes capital leases and debt issuance costs. Fair values of our financial assets included in other noncurrent assets, and of our financial liabilities included in other current liabilities and deferred credits and other liabilities, are measured using an income approach and most inputs are internally generated, which results in a Level 3 classification. Estimated future cash flows are discounted using a rate deemed appropriate to obtain the fair value. All of our long-term debt instruments are publicly traded. A market approach, based upon quotes from major financial institutions, which are Level 2 inputs, is used to measure the fair value of our debt. 15 . Debt Revolving Credit Facility As of June 30, 2019 , we had no borrowings against our $ 3.4 billion revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility ), as described below or under our U.S. commercial paper program that is backed by the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility includes a covenant requiring that our ratio of total debt to total capitalization not exceed 65 % as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. If an event of default occurs, the lenders holding more than half of the commitments may terminate the commitments under the Credit Facility and require the immediate repayment of all outstanding borrowings and the cash collateralization of all outstanding letters of credit under the Credit Facility. As of June 30, 2019 , we were in compliance with this covenant with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 31 % . Long-term debt At June 30, 2019 , we had $ 5.5 billion of total debt outstanding, of which $ 600 million is due June 2020. 16 . Stockholders Equity In the six months ended June 30, 2019 , we acquired approximately 16 million common shares at a cost of $ 250 million , which were held as treasury stock. Including these repurchases, the total remaining share repurchase authorization was $ 550 million at June 30, 2019 . On July 31, 2019, the Board of Directors authorized an extension of the share repurchase program, which increased the remaining share repurchase authorization to $ 1.5 billion . Purchases under the program are made at our discretion and may be in either open market transactions, including block purchases, or in privately negotiated transactions using cash on hand, cash generated from operations or proceeds from potential asset sales. This program may be changed based upon our financial condition or changes in market conditions and is subject to termination prior to completion. 24 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 17 . Incentive Based Compensation Stock options, restricted stock awards and restricted stock units The following table presents a summary of activity for the first six months of 2019 : Stock Options Restricted Stock Awards & Units Number of Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price Awards Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Outstanding at December 31, 2018 6,180,007 $ 24.39 8,504,946 $ 14.04 Granted 648,526 (a) $ 16.79 3,846,526 $ 16.96 Exercised/Vested ( 10,470 ) $ 14.92 ( 3,562,277 ) $ 12.41 Canceled ( 590,624 ) $ 24.01 ( 377,692 ) $ 15.35 Outstanding at June 30, 2019 6,227,439 $ 23.65 8,411,503 $ 16.00 (a) The weighted average grant date fair value of stock option awards granted was $ 6.62 per share. Stock-based performance unit awards During the first six months of 2019 , we granted 656,636 stock-based performance units to certain officers to be settled in shares. The grant date fair value per unit was $ 20.66 , as calculated using a Monte Carlo valuation model. At the grant date, each unit represents the value of one share of our common stock. These units are settled in shares, and the number of shares of our common stock to be paid is based on the vesting percentage, which can be from zero to 200 % based on performance achieved and as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The performance goals are tied to our total shareholder return ( TSR ) as compared to TSR for a group of peer companies determined by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. Dividend equivalents may accrue during the performance period and would be paid in cash at the end of the performance period based on the amount of dividends credited generally over the performance period on shares of our common stock that represent the number of the units granted multiplied by the vesting percentage. 18 .

Commitments and Contingencies In the second quarter of 2019, Marathon E.G. Production Limited ( MEGPL ), a consolidated and wholly-owned subsidiary, signed a series of agreements to process third-party Alen Unit gas through existing infrastructure located in Punta Europa, E.G. MEGPL is a signatory to the agreements related to our equity method investee, Alba Plant LLC. These agreements contain clauses that cause MEGPL to indemnify the owners of the Alen Unit against actions or inaction by Alba Plant LLC. Pursuant to these agreements, MEGPL agreed to indemnify third party property or events, including environmental assessments, injury to Alba Plant LLC personnel, and damage to or loss of Alba Plant LLC automobiles. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate this obligation as we do not have any history of prior indemnification claims, as completion of the plant modifications is not expected to finish until 2021, and as such, we do not have any history of environmental discharge or contamination. Therefore, we have not recorded a liability with respect to these indemnification clauses since the amount of potential future payments under such guarantees is not determinable. 27 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) In the fourth quarter of 2017, the U.K. tax authorities challenged the deductibility for certain Brae area decommissioning costs, which we claimed for U.K. corporation tax purposes. The dispute related to the timing of the deduction and did not dispute the general deductibility of decommissioning costs. In accordance with U.K. regulations, we paid the amount of tax and interest in question, approximately $ 108 million , and filed our appeal. In the first quarter of 2019, we withdrew our appeal on this matter, and the corresponding revisions to current and deferred tax liabilities have no cumulative adverse earnings impact on our consolidated results of operations. We are continuously undergoing examination of our U.S. federal income tax returns by the IRS. With the closure of the 2010-2011 IRS Audit referenced in Note 7 , these audits have been completed through the 2014 tax year with the exception of the following item. During the third quarter of 2017, we received a partnership adjustment notification related to the 2010 and 2011 tax years, for which we have filed a Tax Court Petition in the fourth quarter of 2017. We believe that it is more likely than not that we will prevail. We are a defendant in a number of legal and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business including, but not limited to, royalty claims, contract claims, tax disputes and environmental claims. While the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We have incurred and will continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately offset by the prices we receive for our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes. These laws generally provide for control of pollutants released into the environment and require responsible parties to undertake remediation of hazardous waste disposal sites. Penalties may be imposed for noncompliance. 28 Item 2. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Overview Operations Market Conditions Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted Cash Flows Liquidity and Capital Resources Environmental Matters and Other Contingencies The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the preceding consolidated financial statements and notes in Item 1 . Executive Overview We are an independent exploration and production company based in Houston, Texas focused on U.S. resource plays: the Eagle Ford in Texas, Permian in New Mexico, STACK and SCOOP in Oklahoma, and the Bakken in North Dakota. We also have international operations only in Equatorial Guinea after closing the sale of our U.K. business on July 1, 2019. Total proved reserves were 1.3 billion boe (including 21 million boe of proved reserves for our U.K. business) at December 31, 2018, and total assets were $21.3 billion at June 30, 2019 . During the second quarter of 2019 , we continued the focus on our strategy with simplifying and concentrating our portfolio, a strengthened balance sheet, relentless focus on costs, and profitable growth within cash flows. Key highlights include the following: Simplifying and concentrating our portfolio In July 2019, we closed on the sale of our U.K. business for proceeds of approximately $95 million , reflecting the assumption by the buyer of: working capital and cash equivalent balances of approximately $345 million and the U.K. asset retirement obligations of $966 million . In the second quarter of 2019, we closed on the sale our 15% non-operated interest in the Atrush block in Kurdistan for proceeds of $63 million , before closing adjustments. Strengthened balance sheet and liquidity Returned additional capital to shareholders by acquiring approximately 15 million common shares at a cost of $236 million , with $550 million of repurchase authorization remaining at June 30, 2019 . On July 31, 2019, the Board of Directors authorized an extension of the share repurchase program, which increased the remaining share repurchase authorization to $1.5 billion . At the end of the second quarter 2019, we had approximately $4.4 billion of liquidity, comprised of $1.0 billion in cash and an undrawn $3.4 billion revolving credit facility. Strong financial position with investment grade at all three primary credit ratings agencies. Financial and operational results Total net sales volumes for the quarter were 437 mboed, including 330 mboed in the U.S. resource plays. Our U.S. oil net sales volumes increased 13% compared to the same quarter last year. Our net income per share was $0.20 in the second quarter of 2019 as compared to a net income per share of $0.11 in the same period last year. Included in net income results for the current quarter: A decrease in revenues from contracts with customers of approximately 5% to $1.4 billion , compared to the same quarter last year, primarily as a result of lower price realizations partially offset by higher net sales volumes in the current quarter. 29 Despite higher sales volumes, total costs and expenses from operations decreased $34 million during the quarter compared to the same quarter last year primarily as a result of lower production expenses. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased 7% as commodity price realizations decreased while net sales volumes remained flat in the first six months of 2019 versus the same period last year. Operations The following table presents a summary of our sales volumes for each of our segments. Refer to the Results of Operations section for a price-volume analysis for each of the segments. Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, Net Sales Volumes 2019 2018 Increase (Decrease) 2019 2018 Increase (Decrease) United States (mboed) 330 298 11% 314 291 8% International (mboed) (a) 107 121 (12)% 98 133 (26)% Total (mboed) 437 419 4% 412 424 (3)% (a) We closed on the sale of our Libya subsidiary in the first quarter of 2018. The six months ended June 30, 2018 includes net sales volumes relating to Libya of 16 mboed. See further detail of International net sales volumes below. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. United States Net sales volumes in the segment were higher in the second quarter of 2019 primarily as a result of new wells to sales across all U.S. resource plays. The following tables provide additional details regarding net sales volumes, sales mix and operational drilling activity for our significant operations within this segment: Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, Net Sales Volumes 2019 2018 Increase (Decrease) 2019 2018 Increase (Decrease) Equivalent Barrels (mboed) Eagle Ford 109 106 3% 107 105 2% Bakken 103 82 26% 98 78 26% Oklahoma 82 80 3% 72 77 (6)% Northern Delaware 27 17 59% 27 17 59% Other United States 9 13 (31)% 10 14 (29)% Total United States (mboed) 330 298 11% 314 291 8% Three Months Ended June 30, 2019 Sales Mix - U.S. Resource Plays Eagle Ford Bakken Oklahoma Northern Delaware Total Crude oil and condensate 56% 85% 26% 57% 58% Natural gas liquids 23% 8% 29% 21% 19% Natural gas 21% 7% 45% 22% 23% 30 Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, Drilling Activity - U.S. Resource Plays 2019 2018 2019 2018 Gross Operated Eagle Ford: Wells drilled to total depth 36 33 66 67 Wells brought to sales 41 39 82 73 Bakken: Wells drilled to total depth 20 24 32 43 Wells brought to sales 30 21 59 32 Oklahoma: Wells drilled to total depth 18 10 38 23 Wells brought to sales 18 17 36 34 Northern Delaware: Wells drilled to total depth 14 21 27 41 Wells brought to sales 16 13 31 22 Eagle Ford Our net sales volumes were 109 mboed in the second quarter of 2019 which was 3% higher compared to the prior year quarter. During the second quarter of 2019, we continued to deliver strong results from the expanded core of Atascosa County in terms of well performance. Additionally, we continued efforts to uplift performance outside of the Karnes and Atascosa core, by applying enhanced completion techniques in Gonzales County. Overall, despite a majority of wells to sales outside of Karnes County during second quarter, the Eagle Ford asset achieved a quarterly record for average 30 day initial well productivity, while continuing to drive a trend of lower completed well costs per lateral foot. Bakken Our net sales volumes of 103 mboed represent a 26% increase over the prior year quarter of 82 mboed with company-operated wells to sales balanced between Myrmidon and Hector. We continued to improve capital efficiency, which was highlighted by a six well pad in Myrmidon, with an average completed well cost of $5.3 million. The average completed well cost for all second quarter wells was just $5.2 million. Oklahoma Our net sales volumes in the second quarter of 2019 increased by 3% from the prior year quarter, with net sales volumes of 82 mboed. We continued to deliver strong results from the over-pressured STACK where the eight-well per section Mike Stroud infill achieved average completed well costs more than 30% below the previously drilled parent well. We continued to make significant progress in reducing our cost structure with our two most recent over-pressured STACK infills completed at an average completed well cost of $6.3 million normalized to a 10,000 foot lateral. Northern Delaware Our net sales volumes were 27 mboed in the second quarter of 2019 which was 59% higher compared to the prior year quarter. We continued to make progress in reducing our cost structure and improving margins, with second quarter cash costs down over the prior year on a per boe basis, 100% of water on pipe for all second quarter wells to sales, and a rising percentage of total oil production on pipe. Second quarter again featured strong Upper Wolfcamp productivity in Malaga, with the second quarter completed well costs per lateral foot below the 2018 average. 31 International Net sales volumes were lower in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018 primarily due to natural field decline in E.G. and timing of liftings in the U.K. The following table provides details regarding net sales volumes for our significant operations within this segment: Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, Net Sales Volumes 2019 2018 Increase (Decrease) 2019 2018 Increase (Decrease) Equivalent Barrels (mboed) Equatorial Guinea 95 103 (8)% 85 98 (13)% United Kingdom (a) 10 14 (29)% 11 15 (27)% Libya % 16 (100)% Other International 2 4 (50)% 2 4 (50)% Total International (mboed) 107 121 (12)% 98 133 (26)% Equity Method Investees LNG (mtd) 5,321 6,141 (13)% 4,981 5,843 (15)% Methanol (mtd) 1,134 1,316 (14)% 1,069 1,256 (15)% Condensate and LPG (boed) 11,080 12,689 (13)% 10,488 12,553 (16)% (a) Includes natural gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale. Equatorial Guinea Net sales volumes in the second quarter of 2019 were lower compared to the same period in 2018 as a result of natural field decline. United Kingdom Second quarter of 2019 net sales volumes were lower compared to the second quarter of 2018 primarily due to timing of liftings in the non-operated Foinaven complex. In July 2019, we closed on the sale of our U.K. business. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Libya During the first quarter of 2018 we closed on the sale of our subsidiary in Libya. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. 32 Market Conditions Crude oil and condensate and NGLs benchmarks decreased in the second quarter and first six months of 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018 . As a result, we experienced decreased price realizations associated with those benchmarks. United States The following table presents our average price realizations and the related benchmarks for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas for the second quarter and first six months of 2019 and 2018 .

Alba Plant LLC processes the rich hydrocarbon gas which is supplied by the Alba Field under a fixed price long term contract. Alba Plant LLC extracts NGL and secondary condensate which is then sold by Alba Plant LLC at market prices, with our share of the revenue reflected in income from equity method investments on the consolidated statements of income. Alba Plant delivers the processed dry natural gas to the Alba Field for distribution and sale to AMPCO and EG LNG. Natural gas liquids Wet gas is sold to Alba Plant LLC at a fixed-price term contract resulting in realized prices not tracking market price. Alba Plant LLC extracts and keeps NGLs, which are sold at market price, with our share of income from Alba Plant LLC being reflected in the income from equity method investments on the consolidated statements of income. Natural gas Dry natural gas, processed by Alba Plant LLC on behalf of the Alba Field is sold by the Alba Field to EG LNG and AMPCO at fixed-price long term contracts resulting in realized prices not tracking market price. We derive additional value from the equity investment in our downstream gas processing units EG LNG and AMPCO. EGLNG sells LNG on a market-based long-term contract and AMPCO markets methanol at market prices.

We have multiple crude oil derivative contracts that settle against various indices. We record commodity derivative gains/losses as the index pricing and forward curves change each period. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Income from equity method investments decreased $29 million for the second quarter of 2019 from the comparable 2018 period primarily due to lower prices and lower sales volumes of LPG at our Alba plant, methanol at our AMPCO facility and LNG at our EGLNG production facility. 34 Net gain on disposal of assets decreased $58 million in the second quarter of 2019 primarily related to gain on sale associated with an acreage swap in our Unites States segment in the second quarter of 2018. Production expenses decreased $12 million in the second quarter of 2019 versus the same period in 2018 . Production expenses across our United States segment decreased $6 million primarily due to reduced water hauling costs in the Northern Delaware, with all new wells on pipe in the second quarter; partially offset by increase in other resource plays due to volume. International decreased $6 million primarily as a result of lower U.K. liftings, which resulted in lower sales volumes during the second quarter of 2019 . The second quarter of 2019 production expense rate (expense per boe) for United States was lower primarily due to higher sales volumes and reduced costs in the second quarter of 2019 . The following table provides production expense and production expense rates for each segment: Three Months Ended June 30, ($ per boe) 2019 2018 Increase (Decrease) 2019 2018 Increase (Decrease) Production Expense and Production Expense Rate Expense Rate United States $ 147 $ 153 (4 )% $ 4.89 $ 5.66 (14 )% International $ 46 $ 52 (12 )% $ 4.72 $ 4.71 % Shipping, handling and other operating expenses increased $44 million in the second quarter of 2019 primarily as a result of increased sales volumes in our United States segment. Exploration expenses include unproved property impairments, dry well costs, geological and geophysical, and other, which decreased $39 million in the second quarter of 2019 . The following table summarizes the components of exploration expenses: Three Months Ended June 30, (In millions) 2019 2018 Increase (Decrease) Exploration Expenses Unproved property impairments $ 20 $ 41 (51 )% Dry well costs 10 (100 )% Geological and geophysical 3 8 (63 )% Other 3 6 (50 )% Total exploration expenses $ 26 $ 65 (60 )% Depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased $7 million in the second quarter of 2019 . In our International segment, we had a decrease of $12 million primarily due to lower U.K. liftings during the second quarter of 2019 partially offset by higher production in the U.S. Our segments apply the units-of-production method to the majority of their assets, including capitalized asset retirement costs; therefore volumes have an impact on DD&A expense. The DD&A rate (expense per boe), which is impacted by field-level changes in reserves, capitalized costs and sales volumes, can also impact our DD&A expense. Our International DD&A rate decreased primarily due to timing of liftings in the U.K. Our United States DD&A rate decreased primarily due to non-core asset dispositions in the Gulf of Mexico in the third quarter 2018 and first quarter 2019. The following table provides DD&A expense and DD&A expense rates for each segment: Three Months Ended June 30, ($ per boe) 2019 2018 Increase (Decrease) 2019 2018 Increase (Decrease) DD&A Expense and DD&A Expense Rate Expense Rate United States $ 561 $ 556 1 % $ 18.72 $ 20.48 (9 )% International $ 38 $ 50 (24 )% $ 3.92 $ 4.53 (13 )% Impairments decreased $16 million in the second quarter of 2019 primarily due to timing of non-core proved property dispositions in our International and United States segments. See Note 10 for discussion of the impairments in further detail. 35 General and administrative decreased $18 million in the second quarter of 2019 primarily as a result of change in value of stock-based performance units tied to our total shareholder return ( TSR ) as compared to our peer group. Provision (benefit) for income taxes reflects an effective tax rate from continuing operations of 17% in the second quarter of 2019 , as compared to an effective tax rate of 31% in the second quarter of 2018 . See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for more detail discussion concerning the rate changes. Segment Income Segment income represents income from continuing operations excluding certain items not allocated to operating segments, net of income taxes. A portion of our corporate and operations general and administrative support costs are not allocated to the operating segments. Gains or losses on dispositions, certain impairments, unrealized gains or losses on commodity derivative instruments, pension settlement losses, or other items (as determined by the CODM) are not allocated to operating segments. The following table reconciles segment income to net income: Three Months Ended June 30, (In millions) 2019 2018 Increase (Decrease) United States $ 215 $ 123 $ 92 International 96 142 (46 ) Segment income 311 265 46 Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes (150 ) (169 ) 19 Net income $ 161 $ 96 $ 65 United States segment income increased $92 million after-tax in the second quarter of 2019 primarily due to a net gain on commodity derivatives second quarter of 2019 versus a net loss in the second quarter of 2018 . International segment income decreased $46 million after-tax in the second quarter of 2019 primarily due to lower prices and net sales volumes as a result of natural field decline and additionally lower income from our equity method investments as a result of lower price realizations and sales volumes.

Increase (Decrease) Related to (In millions) Six Months Ended June 30, 2018 Price Realizations Net Sales Volumes Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 United States Price/Volume Analysis Crude oil and condensate $ 1,932 $ (247 ) $ 195 $ 1,880 Natural gas liquids 218 (79 ) 22 161 Natural gas 184 (1 ) (1 ) 182 Other sales 12 39 Total $ 2,346 $ 2,262 International Price/Volume Analysis Crude oil and condensate $ 569 $ (48 ) $ (247 ) $ 274 Natural gas liquids 5 (1 ) (1 ) 3 Natural gas 48 (12 ) (8 ) 28 Other sales 16 14 Total $ 638 $ 319 Net loss on commodity derivatives In the first six months of 2019, the net loss on commodity derivatives was $75 million, compared to the same period in 2018 which was a loss of $254 million. We have multiple crude oil derivative contracts that settle against various indices. We record commodity derivative gains/losses as the index pricing and forward curves change each period. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Income from equity method investments decreased $55 million for the first six months of 2019 from the comparable 2018 period primarily due to lower prices as well as lower sales volumes driven by our planned turnaround in E.G. during the first quarter 2019 . Net gain on disposal of assets decreased $273 million for the first six months of 2019 primarily as a result of the sale of our Libya subsidiary for a pre-tax gain of $255 million in the first quarter of 2018. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for information about dispositions. Other income increased $ 32 million in the first six months of 2019 primarily as a result of indemnification of certain tax liabilities in connection with the closure of the 2010-2011 Federal Tax Audit with the IRS. The indemnity relates to tax and interest allocable to MPC as a result of the IRS Audit in accordance with the Tax Sharing Agreement. See Note 7 for further detail. Production expenses for the first six months of 2019 decreased by $42 million compared to the same period in 2018 . International decreased $23 million primarily due to the timing of our U.K. liftings, which resulted in lower sales volumes, as well as the sale of our Libya subsidiary in the first quarter of 2018. United States decreased $18 million primarily due to non-core asset dispositions in the Gulf of Mexico during the third quarter 2018 and due to reduced water hauling costs in the Northern Delaware, with all new wells on pipe in the second quarter. The first six months of 2019 production expense rate (expense per boe) for our International segment decreased due to change in sales volume mix, which was impacted by the timing of liftings and the sale of our Libya subsidiary in 2018. The following table provides production expense and production expense rates for each segment: Six Months Ended June 30, ($ per boe) 2019 2018 Increase (Decrease) 2019 2018 Increase (Decrease) Production Expense and Production Expense Rate Expense Rate United States $ 286 $ 304 (6 )% $ 5.04 $ 5.77 (13 )% International $ 96 $ 119 (19 )% $ 5.40 $ 4.91 10 % Shipping, handling and other operating expenses increased $ 68 million in the first six months of 2019 from the comparable 2018 period, primarily as a result of increased sales volumes in our United States segment. Exploration expenses include unproved property impairments, dry well costs, geological and geophysical, and other, which decreased $32 million in the first six months of 2019 . 37 The following table summarizes the components of exploration expenses: Six Months Ended June 30, (In millions) 2019 2018 Increase (Decrease) Exploration Expenses Unproved property impairments $ 64 $ 81 (21 )% Dry well costs 5 12 (58 )% Geological and geophysical 9 14 (36 )% Other 7 10 (30 )% Total exploration expenses $ 85 $ 117 (27 )% Depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased $43 million in the first six months of 2019 from the comparable 2018 period, primarily as a result of a decrease of $32 million in our International segment due to lower net sales volumes. Our segments apply the units-of-production method to the majority of their assets, including capitalized asset retirement costs; therefore volumes have an impact on DD&A expense. The DD&A rate (expense per boe), which is impacted by field-level changes in reserves, capitalized costs and sales volumes, can also impact our DD&A expense. The following table provides DD&A expense and DD&A expense rates for each segment: Six Months Ended June 30, ($ per boe) 2019 2018 Increase (Decrease) 2019 2018 Increase (Decrease) DD&A Expense and DD&A Expense Rate Expense Rate United States $ 1,075 $ 1,084 (1 )% $ 18.98 $ 20.56 (8 )% International $ 72 $ 104 (31 )% $ 4.06 $ 4.31 (6 )% Impairments decreased $18 million in the first six months of 2019 from the comparable 2018 period, primarily as a result of second quarter 2018 proved property impairments as a result of anticipated sales of certain non-core proved properties in our International and United States segments. See Note 10 for discussion of the impairments in further detail. General and administrative decreased $24 million in the first six months of 2019 primarily as a result of change in value of stock-based performance units tied to our total shareholder return ( TSR ) as compared to our peer group. Provision (benefit) for income taxes reflects an effective income tax rate of (52)% in the first six months of 2019 , as compared to an effective tax rate of 32% from the comparable 2018 period. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for more detail discussion concerning the components impacting the rate change. 38 Segment Income Segment income represents income excluding certain items not allocated to operating segments, net of income taxes. Aportion of our corporate and operations general and administrative support costs are not allocated to the operating segments. Gains or losses on dispositions, certain impairments, unrealized gains or losses on commodity derivative instruments, pension settlement losses, or other items (as determined by the CODM) are not allocated to operating segments. The following table reconciles segment income (loss) to net income (loss): Six Months Ended June 30, (In millions) 2019 2018 Increase (Decrease) United States $ 347 $ 248 40 % International 157 274 (43 )% Segment income 504 522 (3 )% Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes (169 ) (70 ) 141 % Net income $ 335 $ 452 (26 )% United States segment income increased $99 million after-tax in the first six months of 2019 from the comparable 2018 period primarily due to the loss related to commodity derivative positions in the first six months of 2018 . International segment income decreased $117 million after-tax in the first six months of 2019 from the comparable 2018 period primarily due to lower sales volumes as a result of the planned triennial turnaround in E.G. and the sale of our Libya subsidiary in the first quarter 2018. Critical Accounting Estimates There have been no material changes or developments in the evaluation of the accounting estimates and the underlying assumptions or methodologies pertaining to our Critical Accounting Estimates disclosed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 except as discussed below. Fair Value Estimates - Goodwill See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our annual goodwill impairment test. Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. 39 Cash Flows The following table presents sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents: Six Months Ended June 30, (In millions) 2019 2018 Sources of cash and cash equivalents Operating activities $ 1,312 $ 1,416 Disposal of assets, net of cash transferred to the buyer 69 1,183 Other 50 57 Total sources of cash and cash equivalents $ 1,431 $ 2,656 Uses of cash and cash equivalents Additions to property, plant and equipment $ (1,262 ) $ (1,300 ) Additions to other assets 42 (129 ) Acquisitions, net of cash acquired (25 ) Purchases of common stock (266 ) (11 ) Dividends paid (82 ) (85 ) Other (29 ) (2 ) Total uses of cash and cash equivalents $ (1,597 ) $ (1,552 ) Cash flows generated from operating activities in the first six months of 2019 were 7% lower as commodity price realizations decreased while net sales volumes remained flat compared to 2018 . Consolidated average crude oil and condensate price realizations, inclusive of the impacts of realized gains and losses on commodity derivatives, decreased by approximately 5% dur i ng the first six months of 2019 as compared to the prior period. Proceeds from the disposals of assets for the first six months of 2019 were primarily related to the final proceeds received from the sale of non-operated interest in the Atrush block in Kurdistan. Proceeds from the disposals of assets for the first six months of 2018 were primarily related to the final proceeds received from the sale of our Canadian business and sale of our non-operated interest in Libya. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information concerning dispositions. Additions to property, plant and equipment in the first six months of 2019 were consistent with expectations relative to our $2.6 billion Capital Budget, which includes approximately $2.4 billion of development capital and $200 million to fund resource play leasing and exploration ( REx ). The following table shows capital expenditures by segment and reconciles to additions to property, plant and equipment as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows: Six Months Ended June 30, (In millions) 2019 2018 United States $ 1,292 $ 1,252 International 15 22 Corporate 8 10 Total capital expenditures 1,315 1,284 Change in capital expenditure accrual (53 ) 16 Total use of cash and cash equivalents for property, plant and equipment $ 1,262 $ 1,300 Additions to other assets of $42 million relates to the clearing of deposits related to our resource play leasing and exploration program to property, plant and equipment during the first six months of 2019. During the first six months of 2019 , our REx capital expenditures totaled $74 million , inclusive of costs included within property, plant and equipment and other assets. During the first six months of 2018, additions to other assets related to REx capital expenditures, with total REx expenditures of $248 million, inclusive of costs included within property, plant and equipment, other assets and acquisitions. The Board of Directors approved a $0.05 per share dividend for each of the fourth quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019, which were paid in the first and second quarters of 2019 . See Capital Requirements below for additional information about dividends. In the first six months of 2019 , we acquired approximately 16 million common shares at a cost of $250 million , which were held as treasury stock. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. 40 Liquidity and Capital Resources Our main sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, internally generated cash flow from operations, sales of non-core assets, capital market transactions, and our revolving Credit Facility. At June 30, 2019 , we had approximately $4.4 billion of liquidity consisting of $1.0 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $3.4 billion available under our revolving Credit Facility. Our working capital requirements are supported by these sources and we may issue either commercial paper backed by our Credit Facility or draw on our revolving Credit Facility to meet short-term cash requirements, or issue debt or equity securities through the shelf registration statement discussed below as part of our longer-term liquidity and capital management program. Because of the alternatives available to us as discussed above, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity are adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements including our capital spending programs, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities, and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies. General economic conditions, commodity prices, and financial, business and other factors could affect our operations and our ability to access the capital markets. In the second quarter 2019, we were upgraded to investment grade by Moody Investor Services; and were also upgraded by S&P. Our corporate credit ratings as of June 30, 2019 are: Standard & Poor Ratings Services BBB (stable); Fitch Ratings BBB (stable); and Moody Investor Services, Inc. Baa3 (stable). We are now rated investment grade at all three primary credit rating agencies. In addition, we also have the ability to borrow on our U.S. commercial paper program, which is backed by the revolving credit facility. A downgrade in our credit ratings could increase our future cost of financing or limit our ability to access capital, and could result in additional credit support requirements. See Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for a discussion of how a further downgrade in our credit ratings could affect us. Capital Resources Credit Arrangements and Borrowings At June 30, 2019 , we had no borrowings against our Credit Facility or under our U.S. commercial paper program that is backed by the Credit Facility. At June 30, 2019 , we had $5.5 billion of total debt outstanding, of which $600 million is due June 2020. We do not have any triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an event of default in the case of a downgrade of our credit ratings. Shelf Registration We have a universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer for purposes of SEC rules, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities. Asset Disposal In the second quarter of 2019, we closed on the sale of our 15% non-operated interest in the Atrush block in Kurdistan for proceeds of $63 million , before closing adjustments. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information concerning dispositions. In July 2019, we closed on the sale of our U.K. business (Marathon Oil U.K. LLC and Marathon Oil West of Shetlands Limited), which resulted in proceeds of approximately $95 million and reflects the assumption by RockRose Energy PLC (the buyer) of the U.K. business working capital and cash equivalent balances of approximately $345 million and the U.K. asset retirement obligations of $966 million . The transaction has an effective date of January 1, 2019. Debt-To-Capital Ratio The Credit Facility includes a covenant requiring that our ratio of total debt to total capitalization not exceed 65% as of the last day of the fiscal quarter. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 31% at June 30, 2019 and at December 31, 2018 . Capital Requirements Share Repurchase Program In the six months ended June 30, 2019, we acquired approximately 16 million common shares at a cost of $250 million under our share repurchase program. The current remaining share repurchase authorization is $1.5 billion . 41 Other Expected Cash Outflows On July 31, 2019 , our Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.05 per share for the second quarter of 2019 payable September 10, 2019 to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 21, 2019 . As of June 30, 2019 , we plan to make contributions of up to $12 million to our funded pension plans during the remainder of 2019 . Contractual Cash Obligations In the first quarter of 2019, we entered into various transportation and processing commitments to guarantee capacity on crude oil and natural gas pipelines and natural gas processing facilities, which have varying terms extending as far as 2027. Future commitments remaining as of June 30, 2019 under the arrangements amount to $564 million , of which $10 million is expected to be incurred in the remainder of 2019, $54 million in 2020, $75 million in 2021, $76 million in 2022, $78 million in 2023, and $271 million thereafter. 42 Environmental Matters and Other Contingencies We have incurred and will continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately offset by the prices we receive for our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes. These laws generally provide for control of pollutants released into the environment and require responsible parties to undertake remediation of hazardous waste disposal sites. Penalties may be imposed for noncompliance. There have been no significant changes to the environmental, health and safety matters under Item 1. Business or Item 3. Legal Proceedings in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of other contingencies.
