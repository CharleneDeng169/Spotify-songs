Basis of Presentation The Company American Express Company is a globally integrated payments company that provides customers with access to products, insights and experiences that enrich lives and build business success. Our principal products and services are charge and credit payment card products and travel-related services offered to consumers and businesses around the world. Business travel-related services are offered through the non-consolidated joint venture, American Express Global Business Travel (the GBT JV). Our various products and services are sold globally to diverse customer groups, including consumers, small businesses, mid-sized companies and large corporations. These products and services are sold through various channels, including mobile and online applications, direct mail, in-house sales teams, third-party vendors and direct response advertising. Effective for the second quarter of 2018, we realigned our reportable operating segments to reflect the organizational changes announced during the first quarter of 2018. Prior periods have been revised to conform to the new reportable segments, which are as follows: Global Consumer Services Group (GCSG), which primarily issues a wide range of proprietary consumer cards globally. GCSG also provides services to consumers, including travel services and non-card financing products, and manages certain international joint ventures and our partnership agreements in China. Global Commercial Services (GCS), which primarily issues a wide range of proprietary corporate and small business cards and provides payment and expense management services globally. In addition, GCS provides commercial financing products. Global Merchant and Network Services (GMNS), which operates a global payments network that processes and settles card transactions, acquires merchants and provides multi-channel marketing programs and capabilities, services and data analytics, leveraging our global integrated network. GMNS enters into partnership agreements with third-party card issuers and acquirers, licensing the American Express brand and extending the reach of the global network. GMNS also manages loyalty coalition businesses in certain countries around the world and our reloadable prepaid and gift card businesses. Corporate functions and certain other businesses and operations are included in Corporate & Other. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 (the 2017 Form 10-K). If not materially different, certain footnote disclosures included therein have been omitted from this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The interim consolidated financial information in this report has not been audited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, which consist of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the interim period consolidated financial information, have been made. Results of operations reported for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire year. The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. These accounting estimates reflect the best judgment of management, but actual results could differ. Discount Revenue Discount revenue primarily represents the amount we earn on transactions occurring at merchants that have entered into a card acceptance agreement with us, or a Global Network Services (GNS) partner or other third-party merchant acquirer, for facilitating transactions between the merchants and Card Members. The amount of fees charged, or merchant discount, varies with, among other factors, the industry in which the merchant conducts business, the merchant overall American Express-related transaction volume, the timing and method of payment to the merchant, the method of submission of transactions and, in certain instances, the geographic scope of the card acceptance agreement signed with us (e.g., local or global) and the transaction amount. The merchant discount is generally deducted from the payment to the merchant and recorded as discount revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs. 6 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) The card acceptance agreements, which outline the agreed-upon terms for charging the merchant discount fee, vary in duration. Our contracts with small- and medium-sized merchants generally have no fixed contractual duration, while those with large merchants are generally for fixed periods, which typically range from three to seven years in duration. Our fixed-period agreements may include auto-renewal features, which may allow the existing terms to continue beyond the stated expiration date until a new agreement is reached. We satisfy our obligations under these agreements over the contract term, often on a daily basis, through the processing of Card Member transactions and the availability of our payment network. In cases where the merchant acquirer is a third party (which is the case, for example, under our OptBlue program, or with certain of our GNS partners), we receive a network rate fee in our settlement with the merchant acquirer, which is individually negotiated between us and that merchant acquirer and is recorded as discount revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs. In our role as the operator of the American Express network, we also settle with merchants on behalf of our GNS card issuing partners, who in turn receive an issuer rate that is individually negotiated between that issuer and us and is recorded as expense in Marketing and business development (see below) or as contra-revenue in Other revenue. In contrast with networks such as those operated by Visa Inc. and Mastercard Incorporated, there are no collectively set interchange rates or network rates on the American Express network, and no fees are agreed or due between the GNS partners on the network. Net Card Fees Net card fees represent revenue earned from annual card membership fees, which vary based on the type of card and the number of cards for each account. These fees, net of acquisition costs and a reserve for projected refunds for Card Member cancellations, are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the twelve-month card membership period as Net card fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The unamortized net card fee balance is reported in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Other Fees and Commissions Other fees and commissions includes certain fees charged to Card Members, including delinquency fees and foreign currency conversion fees, which are primarily recognized in the period in which they are charged to the Card Member. Other fees and commissions also includes Membership Rewards program fees, which are deferred and recognized over the period covered by the fee, typically one year, the unamortized portion of which is included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, Other fees and commissions includes loyalty coalition-related fees, travel commissions and fees and service fees earned from merchants, that are recognized when the service is performed, which is generally in the period the fee is charged. Refer to Note 13 for additional information. Contra-revenue P ayments made through contractual arrangements with our merchants, GNS partners, and other customers are classified as expense where we receive goods, services or other benefits, for which the fair value is determinable and measurable. If these conditions are not met, the payment is classified as contra-revenue with the related revenue transaction (e.g., Discount revenue or Other revenue) and recorded when incurred. Interest Income Interest on Card Member loans is assessed using the average daily balance method. Unless the loan is classified as non-accrual, interest is recognized based upon the principal amount outstanding, in accordance with the terms of the applicable account agreement, until the outstanding balance is paid, or written off. Interest and dividends on investment securities primarily relate to our performing fixed-income securities. Interest income is recognized as earned using the effective interest method, which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts, fees and other payments, so that a constant rate of return is recognized on the investment security outstanding balance. Amounts are recognized until securities are in default or when it becomes likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled. Interest on deposits with banks and other is recognized as earned, and primarily relates to the placement of cash, in excess of near-term funding requirements, in interest-bearing time deposits, overnight sweep accounts, and other interest-bearing demand and call accounts. 7 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Interest Expense Interest expense includes interest incurred primarily to fund Card Member loans and receivables, general corporate purposes and liquidity needs, and is recognized as incurred. Interest expense is divided principally into two categories: (i) deposits, which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions, and (ii) debt, which primarily relates to interest expense on our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, as well as the realized impact of derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk on our long-term debt. Marketing and Business Development As further described below under Recently Adopted Accounting Standards, effective January 1, 2018, in conjunction with the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, the previously disclosed Marketing and Promotion line on the Consolidated Statements of Income was changed to Marketing and Business Development to reflect the inclusion of certain reclassified costs from Contra-discount revenue and Other expenses. Marketing and business development provides a more comprehensive view of costs related to building and growing our business, including the reclassified costs. Marketing and business development expense includes costs incurred in the development and initial placement of advertising, which are expensed in the year in which the advertising first takes place. Also included in Marketing and business development expense are Card Member statement credits for qualifying charges on eligible card accounts, corporate incentive payments earned on achievement of preset targets, and certain payments to GNS card issuing partners. These costs are generally expensed as incurred. Card Member Rewards We issue charge and credit cards that allow Card Members to participate in various rewards programs (e.g., Membership Rewards, cobrand and cash back). Rewards expense is recognized in the period Card Members earn rewards, generally by spending on their enrolled card products. We record a Card Member rewards liability that represents the estimated cost of points earned that are expected to be redeemed. Card Member rewards liabilities are impacted over time by enrollment levels, attrition, the volume of points earned and redeemed, and the associated redemption costs. Changes in the Card Member rewards liabilities during the period are taken as a charge or release to the Card Member rewards line. Effective January 1, 2018, in conjunction with the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, Card Member rewards also includes cash-back rewards, which were reclassified from contra discount revenue. Classification of various items Certain reclassifications of prior period amounts have been made to conform to the current period presentation, including the reclassification of certain business development expenses from Other expenses to Marketing and business development, that were not directly attributable to the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new accounting guidance on leases. The standard, effective January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted, would have caused us to recognize virtually all leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheets upon adoption and in the comparative period. However, in July 2018, the FASB issued an update to its guidance providing companies with the option to adopt the provisions of the standard prospectively without adjusting comparative periods; we will elect this option and adopt the standard on January 1, 2019. While we continue to assess the potential impacts upon adoption, we do not expect a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows or regulatory risk-based capital. We are also in the process of upgrading our lease administration software and changing business processes and internal controls in preparation for the adoption. 8 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) In June 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance for the recognition of credit losses on financial instruments, effective January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted on January 1, 2019. The guidance introduces a new credit reserving model known as the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) model, which is based on expected losses, and differs significantly from the incurred loss approach used today. The CECL model requires measurement of expected credit losses not only based on historical experience and current conditions, but also by including reasonable and supportable forecasts incorporating forward-looking information. In addition, for available-for-sale debt securities, the new guidance replaces the other-than-temporary impairment model, and requires the recognition of an allowance for reductions in a security fair value attributable to declines in credit quality, instead of a direct write-down of the security when a valuation decline is determined to be other-than-temporary. The guidance also requires a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the reporting period of adoption. We do not intend to adopt the new standard early and are currently evaluating the impact the new guidance will have on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and regulatory risk-based capital; however, it is expected that the CECL model will alter the assumptions used in estimating credit losses on Card Member loans and receivables, and may result in material increases to our credit reserves as the new guidance involves earlier recognition of expected losses for the life of the assets. We have established an enterprise-wide, cross-discipline governance structure to implement the new standard, and continue to identify and conclude on key interpretive issues along with evaluating our existing credit loss forecasting models and processes in relation to the new guidance to determine what modifications may be required. In February 2018, as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act), the FASB issued new accounting guidance on the reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) to retained earnings. The optional guidance is effective January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating whether we will adopt the new guidance along with any impacts on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, none of which are expected to be material. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted new revenue recognition guidance issued by the FASB related to contracts with customers. The scope of the new guidance excludes financial instruments such as credit and charge card arrangements. We elected to adopt the standard using the full retrospective method, which we believe is most useful to our investors. Under the full retrospective method, we are applying the standard back to January 1, 2016. As shown below, the most significant impacts of adoption are changes to the classification of certain revenues and expenses, including certain credit and charge card related costs previously netted against discount revenue, such as Card Member cash-back reward costs and statement credits, corporate incentive payments, as well as payments to third-party GNS card issuing partners. Under the new revenue standard, these costs are not considered components of the transaction price of our card acceptance agreements with merchants and thus are not netted against discount revenue, but instead are recognized as expenses. Our payments to third-party GNS card issuing partners are presented net of related revenues earned from the partners. The impact to the 2017 fiscal quarters and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows: Increase (Decrease) Three months ended Year Ended December (Millions) December 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 June 30, 2017 March 31, 2017 2017 2016 Revenues Discount revenue $ 981 $ 930 $ 928 $ 868 $ 3,707 $ 3,699 Other (78 ) (71 ) (64 ) (65 ) (278 ) (253 ) Expenses Marketing and business development 617 591 593 549 2,350 2,420 Card Member rewards $ 286 $ 268 $ 271 $ 254 $ 1,079 $ 1,026 In addition, the cumulative impact to our retained earnings on January 1, 2016 was an increase of $55.2 million. The adoption of the new guidance also resulted in changes to the recognition timing of certain revenues, the impact of which is not material to net income. Similarly, the adoption did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Balance Sheets or Statements of Cash Flows. We had no material contract assets, contract liabilities or deferred contract costs recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. Contract assets and liabilities are reported in a net position on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. In adopting the guidance, we implemented changes to our accounting policies, business processes, systems and internal controls to support the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements under the new standard. Such changes were not material. 9 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) In January 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on the recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, which was effective and adopted by us as of January 1, 2018. The guidance makes targeted changes to GAAP; specifically to the classification and measurement of equity securities, and to certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial assets and liabilities. This applies to investments we make in non-public companies in the ordinary course of business, which historically were recognized under the cost method of accounting. These investments will be prospectively adjusted through earnings for observable price changes upon the identification of identical or similar transactions of the same company. The adoption of the guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We implemented changes to our accounting policies, business processes and internal controls in support of the new guidance. Such changes were not material. In August 2017, the FASB issued new accounting guidance providing targeted improvements to the accounting for hedging activities, effective January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted in any interim period or fiscal year before the effective date. The guidance introduces a number of amendments, several of which are optional, that are designed to simplify the application of hedge accounting, improve financial statement transparency and more closely align hedge accounting with an entity risk management strategies. Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the guidance, with no material impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, along with associated changes to our accounting policies, business processes and internal controls in support of the new guidance. Such changes were not material. 2. Business Events During the first quarter of 2018, we acquired from Citibank, N.A. its existing Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. cobrand credit card loan portfolio (the acquired Hilton portfolio). The acquired Hilton portfolio had an outstanding principal and interest balance of approximately $1 billion at acquisition. None of the credit card loans acquired were considered purchased credit impaired at acquisition date. The cash outflows related to this acquisition are reported within the investing section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as a net increase in Card Member receivables and loans. 10 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 3. Loans and Accounts Receivable Our lending and charge payment card products result in the generation of Card Member loans and Card Member receivables, respectively. Card Member loans by segment and Other loans as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 consisted of: (Millions) 2018 2017 Global Consumer Services Group (a) $ 65,400 $ 62,319 Global Commercial Services 12,203 11,080 Card Member loans 77,603 73,399 Less: Reserve for losses 1,937 1,706 Card Member loans, net $ 75,666 $ 71,693 Other loans, net (b) $ 3,431 $ 2,607 (a) Includes approximately $23.7 billion and $25.7 billion of gross Card Member loans available to settle obligations of a consolidated variable interest entity (VIE) as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The balance as of September 30, 2018 also includes loans related to the acquired Hilton portfolio (refer to Note 2).

The following table presents the aging of Card Member loans and receivables as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017: 2018 (Millions) Current 30-59 Days Past Due 60-89 Days Past Due 90+ Days Past Due Total Card Member Loans: Global Consumer Services Group $ 64,490 $ 271 $ 197 $ 442 $ 65,400 Global Commercial Services Global Small Business Services 12,018 46 30 63 12,157 Global Corporate Payments (a) (b) (b) (b) 46 Card Member Receivables: Global Consumer Services Group 18,681 79 48 108 18,916 Global Commercial Services Global Small Business Services $ 16,671 $ 90 $ 49 $ 103 $ 16,913 Global Corporate Payments (a) (b) (b) (b) $ 153 $ 19,687 2017 (Millions) Current 30-59 Days Past Due 60-89 Days Past Due 90+ Days Past Due Total Card Member Loans: Global Consumer Services Group $ 61,491 $ 238 $ 190 $ 400 $ 62,319 Global Commercial Services Global Small Business Services 10,892 43 31 59 11,025 Global Corporate Payments (a) (b) (b) (b) 55 Card Member Receivables: Global Consumer Services Group 20,696 82 54 114 20,946 Global Commercial Services Global Small Business Services $ 15,868 $ 91 $ 54 $ 106 $ 16,119 Global Corporate Payments (a) (b) (b) (b) $ 148 $ 16,982 (a) For Global Corporate Payments (GCP) Card Member loans and receivables in GCS, delinquency data is tracked based on days past billing status rather than days past due. A Card Member account is considered 90 days past billing if payment has not been received within 90 days of the Card Member billing statement date. In addition, if we initiate collection procedures on an account prior to the account becoming 90 days past billing, the associated Card Member loan or receivable balance is classified as 90 days past billing. These amounts are shown above as 90+ Days Past Due for presentation purposes. See also (b). (b) Delinquency data for periods other than 90 days past billing is not available due to system constraints. Therefore, such data has not been utilized for risk management purposes. The balances that are current to 89 days past due can be derived as the difference between the Total and the 90+ Days Past Due balances. 12 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Credit Quality Indicators for Card Member Loans and Receivables The following tables present the key credit quality indicators as of or for the nine months ended September 30: 2018 2017 Net Write-Off Rate Net Write-Off Rate Principal Only (a) Principal, Interest & Fees (a) 30+ Days Past Due as a % of Total Principal Only (a) Principal, Interest & Fees (a) 30+ Days Past Due as a % of Total Card Member Loans: Global Consumer Services Group 2.1 % 2.5 % 1.4 % 1.8 % 2.1 % 1.3 % Global Small Business Services 1.7 % 2.0 % 1.1 % 1.6 % 1.9 % 1.1 % Card Member Receivables: Global Consumer Services Group 1.7 % 1.8 % 1.2 % 1.6 % 1.7 % 1.3 % Global Small Business Services 1.8 % 2.1 % 1.4 % 1.6 % 1.8 % 1.4 % 2018 2017 Net Loss Ratio as a % of Charge Volume 90+ Days Past Billing as a % of Receivables Net Loss Ratio as a % of Charge Volume 90+ Days Past Billing as a % of Receivables Card Member Receivables: Global Corporate Payments 0.11 % 0.8 % 0.10 % 0.9 % (a) We present a net write-off rate based on principal losses only (i.e., excluding interest and/or fees) to be consistent with industry convention.

Investment Securities Investment securities principally include available-for-sale debt securities carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with unrealized gains and losses recorded in AOCI, net of income taxes. Realized gains and losses are recognized upon disposition of the securities using the specific identification method. Investment securities also include equity securities carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Effective January 1, 2018, the unrealized gains and losses on equity securities are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income; prior to January 1, 2018, the unrealized gains and losses on equity securities were recorded in AOCI, net of income taxes.

Overall, for the available-for-sale debt securities in gross unrealized loss positions, (i) we do not intend to sell the securities, (ii) it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the securities before recovery of the unrealized losses, and (iii) we expect that the contractual principal and interest will be received on the securities. As a result, we recognized no other-than-temporary impairment during the periods presented. Contractual maturities for investment securities with stated maturities as of September 30, 2018 were as follows: Estimated (Millions) Cost Fair Value Due within 1 year $ 3,613 $ 3,612 Due after 1 year but within 5 years 1,622 1,590 Due after 5 years but within 10 years 210 204 Due after 10 years 616 618 Total $ 6,061 $ 6,024 The expected payments on state and municipal obligations and mortgage-backed securities may not coincide with their contractual maturities because the issuers have the right to call or prepay certain obligations. 20 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 6. Asset Securitizations We periodically securitize Card Member loans and receivables arising from our card businesses through the transfer of those assets to securitization trusts, American Express Credit Account Master Trust (the Lending Trust) and American Express Issuance Trust II (the Charge Trust and together with the Lending Trust, the Trusts). The Trusts then issue debt securities collateralized by the transferred assets to third-party investors. We perform the servicing and key decision making for the Trusts, and therefore have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the Trusts economic performance, which are the collection of the underlying Card Member loans and receivables. In addition, we hold all of the variable interests in both Trusts, with the exception of the debt securities issued to third-party investors. As of September 30, 2018, our ownership of variable interests was $5.4 billion and $7.7 billion for the Lending Trust and the Charge Trust, respectively. These variable interests held by us provide us with the right to receive benefits and the obligation to absorb losses, which could be significant to both the Lending Trust and the Charge Trust. Based on these considerations, we are the primary beneficiary of the Trusts and therefore consolidate the Trusts. The following table provides information on the restricted cash held by the Lending Trust and the Charge Trust as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets: (Millions) 2018 2017 Lending Trust $ 783 $ 55 Charge Trust 7 Total $ 783 $ 62 These amounts relate to collections of Card Member loans and receivables to be used by the Trusts to fund future expenses and obligations, including interest on debt securities, credit losses and upcoming debt maturities. Under the respective terms of the Lending Trust and the Charge Trust agreements, the occurrence of certain triggering events associated with the performance of the assets of each Trust could result in payment of trust expenses, establishment of reserve funds, or, in a worst-case scenario, early amortization of debt securities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and the year ended December 31, 2017, no such triggering events occurred. 21 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 7.

Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we and our subsidiaries are subject to various pending and potential legal actions, arbitration proceedings, claims, investigations, examinations, information gathering requests, subpoenas, inquiries and matters relating to compliance with laws and regulations (collectively, legal proceedings). We disclose our material legal proceedings under Part II, Item 1. Legal Proceedings in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings in the 2017 Form 10-K. In addition to the matters disclosed under Legal Proceedings, we are being challenged in a number of countries regarding our application of value-added taxes (VAT) to certain of our international transactions, which are in various stages of audit, or are being contested in legal actions (collectively, VAT matters). While we believe we have complied with all applicable tax laws, rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions, the tax authorities may determine that we owe additional VAT. In certain jurisdictions where we are contesting the assessments, we were required to pay the VAT assessments prior to contesting. Our legal proceedings range from cases brought by a single plaintiff to class actions with millions of putative class members. These legal proceedings involve various lines of business and a variety of claims (including, but not limited to, common law tort, contract, application of tax laws, antitrust and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel factual allegations and/or unique legal theories. While some matters pending against us specify the damages claimed by the plaintiff or class, many seek an unspecified amount of damages or are at very early stages of the legal process. Even when the amount of damages claimed against us are stated, the claimed amount may be exaggerated and/or unsupported. As a result, some matters have not yet progressed sufficiently through discovery and/or development of important factual information and legal issues to enable us to estimate an amount of loss or a range of possible loss, while other matters have progressed sufficiently such that we are able to estimate an amount of loss or a range of possible loss. We have accrued for certain of our outstanding legal proceedings. An accrual is recorded when it is both (a) probable that a loss has occurred and (b) the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. There may be instances in which an exposure to loss exceeds the accrual. We evaluate, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the accrual that has been previously recorded, or a revision to the disclosed estimated range of possible losses, as applicable. For those disclosed material legal proceedings and VAT matters where a loss is reasonably possible in future periods, whether in excess of a recorded accrual for legal or tax contingencies, or where there is no such accrual, and for which we are able to estimate a range of possible loss, the current estimated range is zero to $390 million in excess of any accruals related to those matters. This range represents management estimate based on currently available information and does not represent our maximum loss exposure; actual results may vary significantly. As such legal proceedings evolve, we may need to increase our range of possible loss or recorded accruals. Based on our current knowledge, and taking into consideration our litigation-related liabilities, we believe we are not a party to, nor are any of our properties the subject of, any legal proceeding that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or liquidity. However, in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters, it is possible that the outcome of legal proceedings, including the possible resolution of merchant claims, could have a material impact on our results of operations. 23 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 9. Derivatives and Hedging Activities We use derivative financial instruments to manage exposures to various market risks. These instruments derive their value from an underlying variable or multiple variables, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity index or price, and are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These instruments enable end users to increase, reduce or alter exposure to various market risks and, for that reason, are an integral component of our market risk management. We do not transact in derivatives for trading purposes. In relation to our credit risk, under the terms of the derivative agreements we have with our various counterparties, we are not required to either immediately settle any outstanding liability balances or post collateral upon the occurrence of a specified credit risk-related event. Based on our assessment of the credit risk of our derivative counterparties as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, no credit risk adjustment to the derivative portfolio was required. The following table summarizes the total fair value, excluding interest accruals, of derivative assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017: Other Assets Fair Value Other Liabilities Fair Value (Millions) 2018 2017 2018 2017 Derivatives designated as hedging instruments: Fair value hedges - Interest rate contracts (a) $ $ 11 $ 180 $ 34 Net investment hedges - Foreign exchange contracts 247 117 85 89 Total derivatives designated as hedging instruments 247 128 265 123 Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Foreign exchange contracts, including certain embedded derivatives (b) 80 82 137 95 Total derivatives, gross 327 210 402 218 Less: Cash collateral netting (c)(d) (22 ) (6 ) (180 ) (45 ) Derivative asset and derivative liability netting (e) (122 ) (80 ) (122 ) (80 ) Total derivatives, net $ 183 $ 124 $ 100 $ 93 (a) For centrally cleared derivatives, variation margin payments are legally characterized as settlement payments as opposed to collateral. Accordingly, assets and liabilities are disclosed for centrally cleared derivatives, each net of variation margin. We also maintained several bilateral interest rate contracts that are shown gross of any collateral exchanged. (b) Includes foreign currency derivatives embedded in certain operating agreements. (c) Represents the offsetting of the fair value of bilateral interest rate contracts and certain foreign exchange contracts with the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral. (d) We posted $99 million and $146 million as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, as initial margin on our centrally cleared interest rate swaps; such amounts are recorded within Other receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are not netted against the derivative balances. (e) Represents the amount of netting of derivative assets and derivative liabilities executed with the same counterparty under an enforceable master netting arrangement. A majority of our derivative assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 are subject to master netting agreements with our derivative counterparties. We have no derivative amounts subject to enforceable master netting arrangements that are not offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 24 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Fair Value Hedges We are exposed to interest rate risk associated with our fixed-rate long-term debt obligations. At the time of issuance, certain fixed-rate debt obligations are designated in fair value hedging relationships, using interest rate swaps, to economically convert the fixed interest rate to a floating interest rate. We have $24.8 billion and $23.8 billion of fixed-rate debt obligations designated in fair value hedging relationships as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The following table represents the gains and losses associated with the fair value hedges of our fixed-rate long-term debt: Gains (losses) Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (Millions) 2018 2017 2018 2017 Interest expense (a) Other expenses Interest expense (a) Other expenses Fixed-rate long-term debt $ 63 $ 39 $ 331 $ 64 Derivatives designated as hedging instruments (65 ) (31 ) (323 ) (100 ) Total $ (2 ) $ 8 $ 8 $ (36 ) (a) We adopted new accounting guidance providing targeted improvements to the accounting for hedging activities effective January 1, 2018. In compliance with the standard, amounts previously recorded in Other expenses have been prospectively recorded in Total interest expense. Refer to Note 1 for additional information. The carrying values of the hedged liabilities, recorded within Long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, were $24.2 billion and $23.6 billion as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, including offsetting amounts of $513 million and $182 million for the respective periods, related to the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments. We recognized a net increase of $20 million and a net reduction of $24 million in Interest expense on Long-term debt for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and a net increase of $19 million and a net reduction of $105 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, primarily related to the net settlements (interest accruals) on our interest rate derivatives designated as fair value hedges. Net Investment Hedges The gain or loss on net investment hedges, net of taxes, recorded in AOCI as part of the cumulative translation adjustment, were losses of $22 million and $184 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and a gain of $136 million and a loss of $515 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Accumulated losses within AOCI of nil and $18 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and gains of $1 million and losses of $18 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were reclassified into Other expenses upon investment sales or liquidations. Derivatives Not Designated as Hedges The changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are intended to offset the related foreign exchange gains or losses of the underlying foreign currency exposures. The changes in the fair value of the derivatives and the related underlying foreign currency exposures resulted in net losses of $8 million and $15 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and a net gain of $26 million and a net loss of $36 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and are recognized in Other expenses. The changes in the fair value of an embedded derivative resulted in a loss of $5 million and a gain of $1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and losses of $11 million and $1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and are recognized in Card Member services expense. 25 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 10.

The fair values of these financial instruments are estimates based upon the market conditions and perceived risks as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, and require management judgment. These figures may not be indicative of future fair values, nor can our fair value be estimated by aggregating the amounts presented.

(c) Balances include amounts held by a consolidated VIE for which the fair values of Card Member loans were $23.6 billion and $25.6 billion as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, and the fair values of Long-term debt were $18.5 billion and $18.6 billion as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. (d) Presented as a component of Customer deposits on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements We have certain assets that are subject to measurement at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. For these assets, measurement at fair value in periods subsequent to their initial recognition is applicable if they are determined to be impaired. During the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and the year ended December 31, 2017, we did not have any material assets that were measured at fair value due to impairment. Equity investments previously held at cost that are adjusted through earnings for observable price changes are not material. 27 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 11. Guarantees As of September 30, 2018, the maximum potential undiscounted future payments and related liability resulting from guarantees and indemnifications provided by us in the ordinary course of business were $1 billion and $42 million, respectively, and related primarily to our real estate and business dispositions. As of December 31, 2017, the maximum potential undiscounted future payments and related liability were $1 billion and $52 million, respectively. To date we have not experienced any significant losses related to guarantees or indemnifications. Our recognition of these instruments is at fair value. In addition, we establish reserves when a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. 12. Changes In Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income AOCI is comprised of items that have not been recognized in earnings but may be recognized in earnings in the future when certain events occur.

The following is a detail of Other revenues: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, (Millions) 2018 2017 2018 2017 Global Network Services partner revenues $ 62 $ 82 $ 207 $ 261 Other (a) 272 290 853 851 Total Other revenues $ 334 $ 372 $ 1,060 $ 1,112 (a) Other includes revenues arising from net revenue earned on cross-border Card Member spending, merchant-related fees, insurance premiums earned from Card Member travel and other insurance programs, prepaid card and Travelers Cheque-related revenues, earnings from equity method investments (including the GBT JV), and other miscellaneous revenue and fees. Revenue expected to be recognized in future periods related to contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less and contracts with variable consideration (e.g. discount revenue) are not required to be disclosed. Non-interest revenue expected to be recognized in future periods through remaining contracts with customers is not material. The following is a detail of Other expenses: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, (Millions) 2018 2017 2018 2017 Occupancy and equipment $ 489 $ 567 $ 1,493 $ 1,525 Professional services 489 494 1,454 1,506 Other (a) 382 398 1,160 1,144 Total Other expenses $ 1,360 $ 1,459 $ 4,107 $ 4,175 (a) For all periods, Other expense includes general operating expenses, communication expenses, Card and merchant-related fraud losses, foreign currency-related gains and losses, and gains on the sale of equity investments. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, Other expense also includes the loss on a transaction involving the operations of our prepaid reloadable and gift card business. For both the three and nine month periods, Other expense also includes, for the current year, gains on the re-measurement of certain equity investments previously carried at cost, and for the prior year, charges related to our U.S. loyalty coalition and prepaid businesses. 30 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 14. Income Taxes The effective tax rate was 21.9 percent and 25.8 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 21.9 percent and 29.7 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The changes in tax rates for both periods primarily reflect the reduction in the U.S. federal statutory tax rate as a result of the Tax Act. The tax rates in the prior year also reflect the recognition of certain foreign tax credits and the resolution of certain prior years tax items. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded an estimated net discrete tax charge of $2.6 billion related to the Tax Act that was accounted for as a provisional charge under Staff Accounting Bulletin No.118. There were no material changes to this estimate for the current period. We continue to analyze the impacts of the Tax Act; therefore, the 2017 charge continues to be provisional. We are under continuous examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and tax authorities in other countries and states in which we have significant business operations. The tax years under examination and open for examination vary by jurisdiction. We are currently under examination with the IRS for tax years 2008 through 2014. We believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits could decrease within the next 12 months by as much as $330 million, principally as a result of potential resolutions of prior years tax items with various taxing authorities. The prior years tax items include unrecognized tax benefits relating to the deductibility of certain expenses or losses and the attribution of taxable income to a particular jurisdiction or jurisdictions. Of the $330 million of unrecognized tax benefits, approximately $294 million relates to amounts that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate in a future period. 15. Earnings Per Common Share (EPS) The computations of basic and diluted EPS were as follows: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, (Millions, except per share amounts) 2018 2017 2018 2017 Numerator: Basic and diluted: Net income $ 1,654 $ 1,359 $ 4,911 $ 3,954 Preferred dividends (20 ) (21 ) (61 ) (61 ) Net income available to common shareholders 1,634 1,338 4,850 3,893 Earnings allocated to participating share awards (a) (13 ) (11 ) (38 ) (32 ) Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 1,621 $ 1,327 $ 4,812 $ 3,861 Denominator: (a) Basic: Weighted-average common stock 858 878 859 889 Add: Weighted-average stock options (b) 2 3 2 3 Diluted 860 881 861 892 Basic EPS $ 1.89 $ 1.51 $ 5.60 $ 4.34 Diluted EPS $ 1.88 $ 1.51 $ 5.59 $ 4.33 (a) Our unvested restricted stock awards, which include the right to receive non-forfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents, are considered participating securities. Calculations of EPS under the two-class method exclude from the numerator any dividends paid or owed on participating securities and any undistributed earnings considered to be attributable to participating securities. The related participating securities are similarly excluded from the denominator. (b) The dilutive effect of unexercised stock options excludes from the computation of EPS 0.7 million and 0.5 million of options for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 0.7 million and 0.8 million of options for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, because inclusion of the options would have been anti-dilutive. 31 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 16. Regulatory Matters and Capital Adequacy We are supervised and regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve) and are subject to the Federal Reserve requirements for risk-based capital and leverage ratios. Our U.S. bank subsidiary, American Express National Bank (AENB), is the surviving entity that resulted from the conversion of American Express Centurion Bank, a Utah state-chartered industrial bank, into a national banking association, and the subsequent merger of American Express Bank, FSB, a federal savings bank, into the successor entity as of April 1, 2018. AENB is subject to supervision and regulation, including regulatory capital and leverage requirements, by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). Under the risk-based capital guidelines of the Federal Reserve, we are required to maintain minimum ratios of Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), Tier 1 and Total (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) capital to risk-weighted assets, as well as a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to average adjusted on-balance sheet assets) and a supplementary leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to both on-balance sheet and certain off-balance sheet exposures). Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional, discretionary actions by regulators, that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our operating activities. As of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we met all capital requirements to which we were subject and maintained regulatory capital ratios in excess of those required to qualify as well capitalized. The following table presents the regulatory capital ratios: (Millions, except percentages) CET 1 capital Tier 1 capital Total capital CET 1 capital ratio Tier 1 capital ratio Total capital ratio Tier 1 leverage ratio Supplementary leverage ratio September 30, 2018: (a) American Express Company $ 16,636 $ 18,208 $ 20,737 10.8 % 11.8 % 13.4 % 10.1 % 8.6 % American Express National Bank $ 11,504 $ 11,504 $ 13,465 12.5 % 12.5 % 14.6 % 10.0 % 8.3 % December 31, 2017: (a) American Express Company $ 13,189 $ 14,721 $ 17,142 9.0 % 10.1 % 11.8 % 8.6 % (b) % American Express Centurion Bank $ 5,954 $ 5,954 $ 6,547 12.7 % 12.7 % 14.0 % 10.2 % (b) % American Express Bank, FSB $ 6,065 $ 6,065 $ 6,653 12.9 % 12.9 % 14.2 % 11.7 % (b) % Well capitalized ratios (c) 6.5 % 8.0 % 10.0 % 5.0 % N/A Basel III Standards 2018 (d) 6.4 % 7.9 % 9.9 % 4.0 % 3.0 % Minimum capital ratios (e) 4.5 % 6.0 % 8.0 % 4.0 % 3.0 % (a) As a Basel III advanced approaches institution in parallel run, capital ratios are reported using Basel III capital definitions, inclusive of transition provisions for the capital ratios as of December 31, 2017, and risk-weighted assets using the Basel III standardized approach. (b) The minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) requirement of 3 percent became effective January 1, 2018. (c) Represents requirements for banking subsidiaries to be considered well capitalized pursuant to regulations issued under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act. There is no CET1 capital ratio, Tier 1 leverage ratio or SLR requirement for a bank holding company to be considered well capitalized. (d) Basel III minimum capital requirement and additional transitional capital conservation buffer as defined by the Federal Reserve and OCC for calendar year 2018 for advanced approaches institutions. The additional capital conservation buffer does not apply to Tier 1 leverage ratio or SLR. (e) As defined by the regulations issued by the Federal Reserve and OCC. 32 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 17. Reportable Operating Segments We are a globally integrated payments company that is principally engaged in businesses comprising three reportable operating segments: GCSG, GCS and GMNS. Corporate functions and certain other businesses and operations are included in Corporate & Other. Effective January 1, 2018, we changed the methodology used to allocate certain corporate overhead costs and interest income and expense to the operating segments.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&A) Business Introduction When we use the terms American Express, we, our or us, we mean American Express Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, unless we state or the context implies otherwise. We provide our customers with access to products, insights and experiences that enrich lives and build business success. Our principal products and services are charge and credit payment card products and travel-related services offered to consumers and businesses around the world. Our range of products and services includes: Charge card, credit card and other payment and financing products Merchant acquisition and processing, servicing and settlement, and point-of-sale marketing and information products and services for merchants Network services Other fee services, including fraud prevention services and the design and operation of customer loyalty programs Expense management products and services Travel-related services Stored-value/prepaid products Our various products and services are sold globally to diverse customer groups, including consumers, large corporations, mid-sized companies and small businesses. These products and services are sold through various channels, including mobile and online applications, direct mail, in-house sales teams, third-party vendors and direct response advertising. Business travel-related services are offered through our non-consolidated joint venture, American Express Global Business Travel (the GBT JV). We compete in the global payments industry with charge, credit and debit card networks, issuers and acquirers, paper-based transactions (e.g., cash and checks), bank transfer models (e.g., wire transfers and automated clearing house (ACH)), as well as evolving and growing alternative payment and financing providers. As the payments industry continues to evolve, we face increasing competition from non-traditional players that leverage new technologies and customer relationships to create payment or financing solutions. The following types of revenue are generated from our various products and services: Discount revenue, our largest revenue source, represents fees generally charged to merchants for accepting our cards as payment for goods or services sold; Interest on loans, principally represents interest income earned on outstanding balances; Net card fees, represent revenue earned from annual card membership fees, which varies based on the type of card and the number of cards for each account; Other fees and commissions, primarily represent Card Member delinquency fees, foreign currency conversion fees charged to Card Members, loyalty coalition-related fees, travel commissions and fees, and service fees; and Other revenue, primarily represents revenues arising from contracts with partners of our Global Network Services (GNS) business (including commissions and signing fees less issuer rate payments), cross-border Card Member spending, ancillary merchant-related fees, insurance premiums earned from Card Members, prepaid card and Travelers Cheque-related revenues, and earnings from equity method investments (including the GBT JV). Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted new revenue recognition guidance using the full retrospective method, which applies the new standard to each prior reporting period presented, starting January 1, 2016. The adoption changed the recognition timing and classification of certain revenues and expenses, including changes to the presentation of certain credit and charge card related costs that were previously netted against discount revenue. The adoption did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, net income, equity or cash flows. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In addition, we reclassified certain business development expenses, from Other expenses to Marketing and business development, which was not directly attributable to the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance. 34 Table of Contents Effective for the second quarter of 2018, we realigned our reportable segments to reflect the organizational changes announced during the first quarter of 2018. Prior periods have been revised to conform to the new reportable operating segments, which are: Global Consumer Services Group (GCSG), Global Commercial Services (GCS) and Global Merchant and Network Services (GMNS), with corporate functions and certain other businesses and operations included in Corporate & Other. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures Certain of the statements in this Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Refer to the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements section. We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). However, certain information included within this Form 10-Q constitutes non-GAAP financial measures. Our calculations of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the calculations of similarly titled measures by other companies. Bank Holding Company American Express is a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve) is our primary federal regulator. As such, we are subject to the Federal Reserve regulations, policies and minimum capital standards. Business Environment Our results for the third quarter reflect strong performance that continues the momentum from the first half of the year, as we progress against our four strategic imperatives expand our presence in the premium consumer space, build on our position in commercial payments, strengthen our global, integrated network and make American Express an essential part of our customers digital lives. The increases in net income and earnings per share versus the prior year reflected growth across our businesses, as well as a lower tax provision due to the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act). We also returned a significant amount of capital to our shareholders during the quarter through the resumption of our share buyback program and an increase in our dividend. Our worldwide billed business increased 8 percent over the prior year. Our U.S. and international proprietary consumer card issuing businesses saw continued double digit billings growth. The increase in U.S. consumer billings versus the prior year reflected growth in spending within our premium consumer base and strong acquisition of new Card Members through our digital channels. Commercial billings also had a double digit increase, reflecting growth across all of our commercial customer segments. Global Network Services billed business declined due to the impact of the regulatory environment in the European Union and Australia; excluding the billings from those geographies, Global Network Services billed business grew year-over-year. Revenues net of interest expense grew 9 percent, reflecting higher Card Member spending, fee income and net interest income, partially offset by a year-over-year decline in the average discount rate. This decline was less than in recent quarters, as several factors that drove larger declines in the average discount rate began to moderate. These factors included the impact of regulatory changes in Europe and Australia, the continued roll out of our Opt Blue program to drive towards parity merchant coverage in the U.S. and impacts from decisions we made with respect to certain strategic partners. We continue to be focused on driving discount revenue growth. Card Member loans grew year-over-year, in line with the first half of the year, as we continued to expand our lending relationships with existing customers and acquired new Card Members, including the acquisition from Citibank, N.A. of the portion of the Hilton cobrand portfolio that we did not previously own (the acquired Hilton portfolio). Provisions for losses increased, reflecting growth in the loan portfolio and a higher lending write-off rate, moderated by stable delinquency rates. Overall our credit performance has trended better than expected for this year, although we expect write-off rates to continue to gradually increase over time as we grow our loan portfolio. 35 Table of Contents Spending on customer engagement (the aggregate of rewards, Card Member services and marketing and business development expenses) increased year-over-year across all categories. Growth in rewards and Card Member services reflected the growth in billings and continued higher levels of usage across many of our premium travel services. Marketing and business development expense increased due to higher spending on growth initiatives, including on our global brand campaign, continued investments in our cobrand partnerships and higher corporate client incentives. Operating expenses remained well controlled. We plan to continue to make investments that we believe will drive share, scale and relevance and maintain our strong level of revenue growth. While we continue to see some headwinds from a rising interest rate environment, regulation in countries around the world and intense competition, we remain focused on delivering differentiated value to our merchants, customers and business partners and delivering appropriate returns to our shareholders. See Certain legislative, regulatory and other developments in Other Matters for information on certain matters that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 36 Table of Contents American Express Company Consolidated Results of Operations Refer to the Glossary of Selected Terminology for the definitions of certain key terms and related information appearing within this section. The discussions in both the Consolidated Results of Operations and Business Segment Results provide commentary on the variances for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to same periods in the prior year, as presented in the accompanying tables. Effective January 1, 2018, we changed the methodology used to allocate certain corporate overhead costs and interest income and expense to the operating segments. Effective April 1, 2018, we made additional changes to the methodology used to allocate certain corporate overhead costs to the operating segments. Prior period amounts have been revised to conform to the current period presentation. Table 1: Summary of Financial Performance Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, Change September 30, Change (Millions, except percentages and per share amounts) 2018 2017 2018 vs. 2017 2018 2017 2018 vs. 2017 Total revenues net of interest expense $ 10,144 $ 9,290 $ 854 9 % $ 29,864 $ 27,171 $ 2,693 10 % Provisions for losses 817 770 47 6 2,398 1,926 472 25 Expenses 7,209 6,689 520 8 21,175 19,618 1,557 8 Pretax income 2,118 1,831 287 16 6,291 5,627 664 12 Income tax provision 464 472 (8 ) (2 ) 1,380 1,673 (293 ) (18 ) Net income 1,654 1,359 295 22 4,911 3,954 957 24 Earnings per common share - diluted (a) $ 1.88 $ 1.51 $ 0.37 25 % $ 5.59 $ 4.33 $ 1.26 29 % Return on average equity (b) 18.1 % 22.6 % 18.1 % 22.6 % Effective tax rate 21.9 % 25.8 % 21.9 % 29.7 % (a) Earnings per common share diluted was reduced by the impact of (i) earnings allocated to participating share awards of $13 million and $11 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $38 million and $32 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and (ii) dividends on preferred shares of $20 million and $21 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $61 million for both the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017. (b) Return on average equity (ROE) is computed by dividing (i) one-year period net income ($3.7 billion and $4.8 billion for September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively) by (ii) one-year average total shareholders equity ($20.4 billion and $21.0 billion for September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively). Table 2: Total Revenue Net of Interest Expense Summary Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, Change September 30, Change (Millions, except percentages) 2018 2017 2018 vs. 2017 2018 2017 2018 vs. 2017 Discount revenue $ 6,181 $ 5,700 $ 481 8 % $ 18,264 $ 16,830 $ 1,434 9 % Net card fees 870 786 84 11 2,544 2,305 239 10 Other fees and commissions 798 755 43 6 2,365 2,212 153 7 Other 334 372 (38 ) (10 ) 1,060 1,112 (52 ) (5 ) Total non-interest revenues 8,183 7,613 570 7 24,233 22,459 1,774 8 Total interest income 2,738 2,245 493 22 7,740 6,244 1,496 24 Total interest expense 777 568 209 37 2,109 1,532 577 38 Net interest income 1,961 1,677 284 17 5,631 4,712 919 20 Total revenues net of interest expense $ 10,144 $ 9,290 $ 854 9 % $ 29,864 $ 27,171 $ 2,693 10 % 37 Table of Contents Total Revenues Net of Interest Expense Discount revenue increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily due to growth in billed business of 8 percent and 10 percent for the three and nine month periods, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in the average discount rate. U.S. billed business increased 10 percent for both periods. Non-U.S. billed business increased 5 percent and 10 percent for the three and nine month periods, respectively. See Tables 5, 6 and 7 for more details on billed business performance. The decreases in the average discount rate for both the three and nine month periods primarily reflected rate reductions related to merchant negotiations, including rate pressure resulting from recent regulatory changes affecting competitor pricing in certain international countries and the continued growth of the OptBlue program, and additionally for the nine month period, changes in industry and geographic mix. We expect the average discount rate will continue to decline over time due to a greater shift of existing merchants into OptBlue, merchant negotiations and competition, volume-related pricing discounts, certain pricing initiatives mainly driven by pricing regulation (including regulation of competitors interchange rates) and other factors. Net card fees increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by growth in the Platinum and Delta portfolios, as well as growth in certain key international countries. Other fees and commissions increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by growth in foreign exchange conversion revenue, and increases in delinquency fees and travel commissions and fees. Other revenues decreased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by a modification of one of our GNS arrangements, and additionally in the nine month period, by a decline in revenues related to the GBT JV. Interest income increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by higher average Card Member loans, and additionally in the nine month period, by higher yields. The growth in average Card Member loans was primarily driven by expanding relationships with existing customers, as well as the inclusion of the acquired Hilton portfolio. The increase in yields in the nine month period was primarily driven by a greater percentage of loans at higher rate buckets and specific pricing actions. Interest expense increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by higher interest rates, higher average deposits and higher average long-term debt. Table 3: Provisions for Losses Summary Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, Change September 30, Change (Millions, except percentages) 2018 2017 2018 vs. 2017 2018 2017 2018 vs. 2017 Charge card $ 214 $ 214 $ % $ 701 $ 590 $ 111 19 % Card Member loans 560 531 29 5 1,587 1,272 315 25 Other 43 25 18 72 110 64 46 72 Total provisions for losses $ 817 $ 770 $ 47 6 % $ 2,398 $ 1,926 $ 472 25 % Provisions for Losses Charge card provision for losses was flat and increased for the three and nine month periods, respectively. The increase in the nine month period was primarily driven by growth in receivables due to increased billed business and higher net write-offs, largely in the corporate and small business portfolios. In the three month period, the growth in receivables was offset by an increase in reserves in the prior year, in part related to the hurricanes. Card Member loans provision for losses increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by continued strong loan growth and higher net write-offs, in part due to the seasoning of recent loan vintages. Over the past several quarters, delinquency rates have stabilized, resulting in a smaller increase in provision in the three month period. Other provision for losses increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily due to growth in the non-card lending portfolio. 38 Table of Contents Table 4: Expenses Summary Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, Change September 30, Change (Millions, except percentages) 2018 2017 2018 vs. 2017 2018 2017 2018 vs. 2017 Marketing and business development (a) $ 1,642 $ 1,446 $ 196 14 % $ 4,650 $ 4,187 $ 463 11 % Card Member rewards 2,400 2,168 232 11 7,180 6,425 755 12 Card Member services 457 351 106 30 1,282 1,009 273 27 Total marketing, business development, rewards and Card Member services 4,499 3,965 534 13 13,112 11,621 1,491 13 Salaries and employee benefits 1,350 1,265 85 7 3,956 3,822 134 4 Other, net (a) 1,360 1,459 (99 ) (7 ) 4,107 4,175 (68 ) (2 ) Total expenses $ 7,209 $ 6,689 $ 520 8 % $ 21,175 $ 19,618 $ 1,557 8 % (a) Effective January 1, 2018, includes reclassification of certain business development expenses from Other expenses to Marketing and business development that are not directly attributable to the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance. Prior periods have been conformed to the current period presentation. Expenses Marketing and business development expense increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily due to higher spending on growth initiatives including our new global brand campaign, continued investments in partnerships, and increased corporate client incentives driven by higher volumes. Card Member rewards expense increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by increases in cobrand rewards expense of $91 million and $371 million and Membership Rewards and cash-back reward expenses of $141 million and $384 million, for the three and nine month periods, respectively, all of which were primarily driven by higher spending volumes. The Membership Rewards Ultimate Redemption Rate (URR) for current program participants increased to 96 percent (rounded up) at September 30, 2018 from 95 percent (rounded down) at September 30, 2017. The increase in the URR reflects continued higher engagement in our Membership Rewards program. Card Member services expense increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by higher usage of travel-related benefits, in addition to enhanced Platinum card benefits in the nine month period. Salaries and employee benefits expense increased for both the three and nine month periods, respectively, in part driven by increases in incentive compensation, partially offset in the nine month period by lower restructuring costs. Other expenses decreased for both the three and nine month periods. The decrease in both periods was primarily driven by charges in the prior year related to our U.S. loyalty coalition and prepaid businesses and current-year gains on certain equity investments, partially offset by a foreign exchange loss in the current period related to the devaluation of the Argentine peso, which was deemed a highly inflationary currency as of July 1, 2018. In addition, the decrease in the nine month period was further partially offset by a benefit in the prior year from a change in the liability related to non-delivery of goods and services by merchants and a loss in the current year on a transaction involving the operations of our prepaid reloadable and gift card business. Income Taxes The effective tax rate decreased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily reflecting the reduction in the U.S. federal statutory tax rate as a result of the Tax Act.

(b) We present a net write-off rate based on principal losses only (i.e., excluding interest and/or fees) to be consistent with industry convention. In addition, as our practice is to include uncollectible interest and/or fees as part of our total provision for losses, a net write-off rate including principal, interest and/or fees is also presented. The net write-off rates and 30+ days past due as a percentage of total for Card Member receivables relate to GCSG and Global Small Business Services (GSBS) Card Member receivables. (c) Global Corporate Payments (GCP) reflects global, large and middle market corporate accounts. For GCP Card Member receivables, delinquency data is tracked based on days past billing status rather than days past due. A Card Member account is considered 90 days past billing if payment has not been received within 90 days of the Card Member billing statement date. In addition, if we initiate collection procedures on an account prior to the account becoming 90 days past billing, the associated Card Member receivable balance is classified as 90 days past billing. These amounts are shown above as 90+ Days Past Due for presentation purposes. GCP delinquency data for periods other than 90 days past billing is not available due to system constraints. 43 Table of Contents Table 9: Net Interest Yield on Average Card Member Loans Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, (Millions, except percentages and where indicated) 2018 2017 2018 2017 Net interest income $ 1,961 $ 1,677 $ 5,631 $ 4,712 Exclude: Interest expense not attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio (a) 390 309 1,051 852 Interest income not attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio (b) (274 ) (174 ) (723 ) (460 ) Adjusted net interest income (c) $ 2,077 $ 1,812 $ 5,959 $ 5,104 Average Card Member loans (billions) $ 76.4 $ 67.1 $ 74.5 $ 65.4 Net interest income divided by average Card Member loans (c) 10.3 % 10.0 % 10.1 % 9.6 % Net interest yield on average Card Member loans (c) 10.8 % 10.7 % 10.7 % 10.4 % (a) Primarily represents interest expense attributable to maintaining our corporate liquidity pool and funding Card Member receivables. (b) Primarily represents interest income attributable to Other loans, interest-bearing deposits and the fixed income investment portfolios. (c) Adjusted net interest income and net interest yield on average Card Member loans are non-GAAP measures. Refer to Glossary of Selected Terminology for the definitions of these terms. We believe adjusted net interest income is useful to investors because it represents the interest expense and interest income attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio and is a component of net interest yield on average Card Member loans, which provides a measure of profitability of our Card Member loan portfolio. Net interest yield on average Card Member loans reflects adjusted net interest income divided by average Card Member loans, computed on an annualized basis. Net interest income divided by average Card Member loans, computed on an annualized basis, a GAAP measure, includes elements of total interest income and total interest expense that are not attributable to the Card Member loan portfolio, and thus is not representative of net interest yield on average Card Member loans. 44 Table of Contents Business Segment Results Global Consumer Services Group Table 10: GCSG Selected Income Statement Data Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, Change September 30, Change (Millions, except percentages) 2018 2017 2018 vs. 2017 2018 2017 2018 vs. 2017 Revenues Non-interest revenues $ 3,680 $ 3,361 $ 319 9 % $ 10,849 $ 9,843 1,006 10 % Interest income 2,140 1,781 359 20 6,083 4,941 1,142 23 Interest expense 404 281 123 44 1,101 741 360 49 Net interest income 1,736 1,500 236 16 4,982 4,200 782 19 Total revenues net of interest expense 5,416 4,861 555 11 15,831 14,043 1,788 13 Provisions for losses 609 568 41 7 1,704 1,355 349 26 Total revenues net of interest expense after provisions for losses 4,807 4,293 514 12 14,127 12,688 1,439 11 Expenses Marketing, business development, rewards and Card Member services 2,711 2,351 360 15 7,852 6,754 1,098 16 Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses 1,118 1,026 92 9 3,288 3,146 142 5 Total expenses 3,829 3,377 452 13 11,140 9,900 1,240 13 Pretax segment income 978 916 62 7 2,987 2,788 199 7 Income tax provision 199 236 (37 ) (16 ) 612 820 (208 ) (25 ) Segment income $ 779 $ 680 $ 99 15 % $ 2,375 $ 1,968 407 21 % Effective tax rate 20.3 % 25.8 % 20.5 % 29.4 % GCSG primarily issues a wide range of proprietary consumer cards globally. GCSG also provides services to consumers, including travel services and non-card financing products, and manages certain international joint ventures and our partnership agreements in China. Non-interest revenues increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by discount revenue, which increased $228 million, or 10 percent, and $698 million, or 11 percent, for the three and nine month periods, respectively, reflecting increases in proprietary consumer billed business of 11 percent and 13 percent, respectively, partially offset by declines in the average discount rate. U.S. proprietary consumer billed business increased 10 percent and 11 percent for the three and nine month periods, respectively. Non-U.S. proprietary consumer billed business increased 14 percent and 20 percent for the three and nine month periods, respectively. The increases in billed business reflected higher cards-in-force and higher average spend per card. Net card fees increased in both periods, driven primarily by growth in the Platinum and Delta portfolios, as well as growth across certain key international countries. Other fees and commissions increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by increases in travel commissions, delinquency fees and foreign exchange conversion revenue. Net interest income increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by growth in average Card Member loans, and additionally in the nine month period, by higher yields, partially offset by higher interest expense, primarily driven by higher cost of funds. The growth in average Card Member loans was primarily driven by expanding relationships with existing customers, as well as the inclusion of the acquired Hilton portfolio. The increase in yields in the nine month period was primarily driven by a greater percentage of loans at higher rate buckets and specific pricing actions. Provisions for losses increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by continued strong growth in both card and non-card lending and higher write-offs, in part due to the seasoning of recent loan vintages. Over the past several quarters, delinquency rates have stabilized, resulting in a smaller increase in provision in the three month period. 45 Table of Contents Marketing, business development, rewards and Card Member services expenses increased for both the three and nine month periods across all expense categories. Card Member rewards expense increased $154 million and $545 million for the three and nine month periods, respectively, driven by increased spending volumes. The increase in marketing and business development expenses was primarily due to higher spending on growth initiatives and higher cobrand partner payments as a result of recent cobrand agreements. The increase in Card Member services expenses was primarily driven in both periods by higher usage of travel-related benefits and, in the nine month period, by the enhanced Platinum card benefits. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by increases in payroll costs, partially offset, in the nine month period, by gains on certain equity investments. The effective tax rate was lower for both the three and nine month periods, primarily reflecting the reduction in the U.S. federal statutory tax rate as a result of the Tax Act. The tax rates in the prior year also reflect the recognition of certain foreign tax credits and the resolution of certain prior years tax items.

GCS primarily issues a wide range of proprietary corporate and small business cards and provides payment and expense management services globally. In addition, GCS provides commercial financing products. Non-interest revenues increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by higher discount revenue due to increases in billed business, partially offset by declines in the average discount rate. The increase in non-interest revenues in both periods was also driven by higher net card fees and higher other fees and commissions, primarily due to growth in the U.S. small business Platinum portfolio and increases in delinquency fees, respectively. Net interest income increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by an increase in average Card Member loans, and additionally in the nine month period, by higher yields, partially offset in both periods by higher interest expense, reflecting an increase in the cost of funds. Provisions for losses increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by growth in the commercial financing portfolio and additionally in the nine month period, by growth in both Card Member loans and receivables and higher net write-offs across both corporate and small business portfolios. Marketing, business development, rewards and Card Member services expenses increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by increases in Card Member rewards expenses and marketing and business development expenses, both of which were due to higher spending volumes, as well as an increase in spending on growth initiatives. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by higher technology and other servicing-related costs. The effective tax rate was lower for both the three and nine months, primarily reflecting the reduction in the U.S. federal statutory tax rate as a result of the Tax Act. 49 Table of Contents Table 14: GCS Selected Statistical Information As of or for the Change As of or for the Change Three Months Ended 2018 Nine Months Ended 2018 September 30, vs. September 30, vs. (Millions, except percentages and where indicated) 2018 2017 2017 2018 2017 2017 Proprietary billed business (billions) $ 121.6 $ 109.7 11 % $ 359.3 $ 321.5 12 % Proprietary cards-in-force 14.4 13.9 4 14.4 13.9 4 Average Card Member spending (dollars) $ 8,469 $ 7,907 7 $ 25,297 $ 23,364 8 Total segment assets (billions) (a) $ 54.0 $ 49.3 10 $ 54.0 $ 49.3 10 Card Member loans (billions) $ 12.2 $ 10.7 14 $ 12.2 $ 10.7 14 Card Member receivables (billions) $ 36.6 $ 33.8 8 $ 36.6 $ 33.8 8 GSBS Card Member loans: (b) Total loans (billions) $ 12.2 $ 10.7 14 $ 12.2 $ 10.7 14 Average loans (billions) $ 11.9 $ 10.5 13 $ 11.5 $ 10.1 14 Net write-off rate - principal only (c) 1.7 % 1.6 % 1.7 % 1.6 % Net write-off rate - principal, interest and fees (c) 2.0 % 1.9 % 2.0 % 1.9 % 30+ days past due as a % of total 1.1 % 1.1 % 1.1 % 1.1 % Calculation of Net Interest Yield on Average Card Member loans: Net interest income $ 198 $ 192 $ 593 $ 577 Exclude: Interest expense not attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio (d) 161 122 439 333 Interest income not attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio (e) (42 ) (29 ) (117 ) (84 ) Adjusted net interest income (f) $ 317 $ 285 $ 915 $ 826 Average Card Member loans (billions) $ 12.0 $ 10.5 $ 11.6 $ 10.1 Net interest income divided by average Card Member loans (f) 6.6 % 7.3 % 6.8 % 7.6 % Net interest yield on average Card Member loans (f) 10.5 % 10.7 % 10.6 % 10.9 % GCP Card Member receivables: Total receivables (billions) $ 19.7 $ 17.9 10 $ 19.7 $ 17.9 10 90+ days past billing as a % of total (g) 0.8 % 0.9 % 0.8 % 0.9 % Net loss ratio (as a % of charge volume) (h) 0.12 % 0.09 % 0.11 % 0.10 % GSBS Card Member receivables: Total receivables (billions) $ 16.9 $ 15.9 6 % $ 16.9 $ 15.9 6 % Net write-off rate - principal only (c) 1.8 % 1.5 % 1.8 % 1.6 % Net write-off rate - principal and fees (c) 2.0 % 1.7 % 2.1 % 1.8 % 30+ days past due as a % of total 1.4 % 1.4 % 1.4 % 1.4 % (a) Includes changes in certain corporate allocations that are not directly attributable to our new segment structure.

GMNS operates a global payments network that processes and settles card transactions, acquires merchants and provides multi-channel marketing programs and capabilities, services and data analytics, leveraging our global integrated network. GMNS enters into partnership agreements with third-party card issuers and acquirers, licensing the American Express brand and extending the reach of the global network. GMNS also manages loyalty coalition businesses in certain countries around the world and our reloadable prepaid and gift card businesses. Non-interest revenues were flat and increased for the three and nine month periods, respectively, primarily driven by billed business growth, partially offset by a decline in the average discount rate and a modification of one of our GNS arrangements. Net interest income increased for both the three and nine month periods, reflecting a higher interest expense credit relating to internal transfer pricing, which results in a net benefit for GMNS due to its merchant payables. Marketing, business development, rewards and Card Member services expenses increased for the three month period and decreased for the nine month period. The increase in the three month period was primarily driven by payments related to our new prepaid partner arrangement, which was more than offset in the nine month period by lower levels of network partnership payments in certain countries. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses decreased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by prior-year charges related to our U.S. loyalty coalition and prepaid businesses, partially offset in the nine month period, by a prior year benefit from a change in the liability related to non-delivery of goods and services by merchants. The effective tax rate decreased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily reflecting the reduction in the U.S. federal statutory tax rate as a result of the Tax Act. The tax rates in the prior year also reflect the recognition of certain foreign tax credits and the resolution of certain prior years tax items. 51 Table of Contents Corporate & Other Corporate functions and certain other businesses are included in Corporate & Other. Corporate & Other net expense was $311 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018, compared to $246 million in the same period a year ago and $819 million for the nine month period compared to $730 million in the same period a year ago. The increase in net expense for both periods was driven in part by increases in incentive compensation and a foreign exchange loss related to the devaluation of the Argentine peso, which was deemed a highly inflationary currency as of July 1, 2018, partially offset by gains on certain equity investments. CONSOLIDATED CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Our balance sheet management objectives are to maintain: A solid and flexible equity capital profile; A broad, deep and diverse set of funding sources to finance our assets and meet operating requirements; and Liquidity programs that enable us to continuously meet expected future financing obligations and business requirements for at least a twelve-month period, even in the event we are unable to continue to raise new funds under our traditional funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions. Basel III The following table presents our regulatory risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios as of September 30, 2018. Effective April 1, 2018, our bank subsidiaries, American Express Centurion Bank and American Express Bank, FSB, were merged to become American Express National Bank (AENB). Refer to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

(c) We became subject to the minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) requirement of 3 percent effective January 1, 2018. 52 Table of Contents Table 17: Regulatory Risk-Based Capital Components and Risk Weighted Assets American Express Company September 30, ($ in Billions) 2018 Risk-Based Capital Common Equity Tier 1 $ 16.6 Tier 1 Capital 18.2 Tier 2 Capital (a) 2.5 Total Capital 20.7 Risk-Weighted Assets 154.7 Average Total Assets to calculate the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio 179.8 Total Leverage Exposure to calculate supplementary leverage ratio $ 210.7 (a) Tier 2 capital is the sum of the allowance for loan and receivable losses (limited to 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets) and $600 million of subordinated notes adjusted for capital held by insurance subsidiaries. We seek to maintain capital levels and ratios in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements and finance such capital in a cost efficient manner; failure to maintain minimum capital levels could affect our status as a financial holding company and cause regulatory agencies to take actions that could limit our business operations. Our primary source of equity capital has been the generation of net income. Capital generated through net income and other sources, such as the exercise of stock options by employees, is used to maintain a strong balance sheet, support asset growth and engage in acquisitions, with excess available for distribution to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We currently expect that the portion of generated capital we allocate to support asset growth will be greater going forward than it has been historically due to projected asset growth. We maintain certain flexibility to shift capital across our businesses as appropriate. For example, we may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements. These infused amounts can affect the capital profile and liquidity levels at the American Express parent company level. The following are definitions for our regulatory risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratio, which are calculated as per standard regulatory guidance: Risk-Weighted Assets Assets are weighted for risk according to a formula used by the Federal Reserve to conform to capital adequacy guidelines. On- and off-balance sheet items are weighted for risk, with off-balance sheet items converted to balance sheet equivalents, using risk conversion factors, before being allocated a risk-adjusted weight. Off-balance sheet exposures comprise a minimal part of the total risk-weighted assets. Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio Calculated as Common Equity Tier 1 capital (CET1), divided by risk-weighted assets. CET1 is the sum of common shareholders equity, adjusted for ineligible goodwill and intangible assets, certain deferred tax assets, as well as certain other comprehensive income items as follows: net unrealized gains/losses on securities and derivatives, and net unrealized pension and other postretirement benefit/losses, all net of tax. Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio Calculated as Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 capital is the sum of CET1, our perpetual preferred stock and third-party non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries adjusted for capital held by insurance subsidiaries and deferred tax assets from net operating losses not deducted from CET1. The minimum requirement for the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is 1.5 percent higher than the minimum for the CET1 risk-based capital ratio. We have $1.6 billion of preferred shares outstanding to help address a portion of the Tier 1 capital requirements in excess of common equity requirements. Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio Calculated as the sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 2 capital is the sum of the allowance for loan and receivable losses (limited to 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets), a portion of the unrealized gains on equity securities and $600 million of subordinated notes, adjusted for capital held by insurance subsidiaries. Tier 1 Leverage Ratio Calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by our average total consolidated assets for the most recent quarter. Supplementary Leverage Ratio Calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by total leverage exposure under Basel III. Leverage exposure, which reflects average total consolidated assets with adjustments for Tier 1 capital deductions, average off-balance sheet derivatives exposures, securities purchased under agreements to resell and credit equivalents of undrawn commitments that are both conditionally and unconditionally cancellable. 53 Table of Contents Share Repurchases and Dividends We return capital to common shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The share repurchases reduce common shares outstanding and more than offset the issuance of new shares as part of employee compensation plans. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, we returned $1.1 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, to our shareholders in the form of common stock dividends ($0.3 billion and $0.9 billion, respectively) and share repurchases ($0.8 billion in the three-month period; we suspended our share buyback program for the first half of 2018 in order to rebuild our capital levels and ratios). We repurchased 7 million common shares at an average price of $105.06 in the third quarter of 2018. These dividend and share repurchase amounts collectively represent approximately 66 percent and 35 percent of total capital generated during the three and nine-month periods, respectively. In addition, during the three months ended September 30, 2018, we had $750 million of non-cumulative perpetual preferred shares (the Series B Preferred Shares) and $850 million of non-cumulative perpetual preferred shares (the Series C Preferred Shares) outstanding. Dividends declared and paid on Series C Preferred Shares during the third quarter of 2018 were $20 million. Funding Strategy Our principal funding objective is to maintain broad and well-diversified funding sources to allow us to meet our maturing obligations, cost-effectively finance current and future asset growth in our global businesses as well as to maintain a strong liquidity profile. We meet our funding needs through a variety of sources, including direct and third-party distributed deposits and debt instruments, such as senior unsecured debentures, asset securitizations, borrowings through secured borrowing facilities and a long-term committed bank borrowing facility. While we diversify our funding sources by maintaining scale and relevance in unsecured debentures, asset securitizations and deposits, we currently expect that the Personal Savings High Yield Savings Account direct retail deposit program will become a larger proportion over time. Summary of Consolidated Debt We had the following consolidated debt and customer deposits outstanding as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017: Table 18: Summary of Consolidated Debt and Customer Deposits (Billions) September 30, 2018 December 31, 2017 Short-term borrowings $ 2.3 $ 3.3 Long-term debt 55.3 55.8 Total debt 57.6 59.1 Customer deposits 69.3 64.5 Total debt and customer deposits $ 126.9 $ 123.6 We may redeem from time to time certain debt securities within 31 days prior to the original contractual maturity dates in accordance with the optional redemption provisions of those debt securities. During the three months ended September 30, 2018, we issued (i) $3.0 billion of asset-backed securities from the American Express Credit Account Master Trust (the Lending Trust) consisting of $1.2 billion of three year Class A Certificates at a fixed rate of 3.06 percent, $525 million of five year Class A Certificates at a floating rate of 1-month LIBOR plus 36 basis points, $800 million of three year Class A Certificates at a fixed rate of 3.18 percent, and $500 million of five year Class A Certificates at a floating rate of 1-month LIBOR plus 38 basis points, and (ii) $2.4 billion of senior unsecured notes from American Express Company consisting of $1.9 billion of five year notes at a fixed rate of 3.70 percent and $500 million of five year notes at a floating rate of 3-month LIBOR plus 75 basis points. 54 Table of Contents Our equity capital and funding strategies are designed, among other things, to maintain appropriate and stable unsecured debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies: Moody Investor Services (Moody s), Standard & Poor (S&P), Fitch Ratings (Fitch) and Dominion Bond Rating Services (DBRS). Such ratings help support our access to cost-effective unsecured funding as part of our overall funding strategy. Our asset securitization activities are rated separately. Table 19: Unsecured Debt Ratings Credit Agency American Express Entity Short-Term Ratings Long-Term Ratings Outlook DBRS All rated entities R-1 (middle) A (high) Positive Fitch All rated entities F1 A Stable Moody TRS and rated operating subsidiaries (a) Prime-1 A2 Stable Moody's American Express Company Prime-2 A3 Stable S&P TRS (a) N/A A- Stable S&P Other rated operating subsidiaries A-2 A- Stable S&P American Express Company A-2 BBB+ Stable (a) American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. Downgrades in the ratings of our unsecured debt or asset securitization program securities could result in higher funding costs, as well as higher fees related to borrowings under our unused lines of credit. Declines in credit ratings could also reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets. We believe our funding mix, including the proportion of U.S. retail deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on our funding capacity and costs. Liquidity Management Our liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of on- and off-balance sheet liquidity sources. We seek to maintain liquidity sources in amounts sufficient to meet our expected future financial obligations and business requirements for liquidity for a period of at least twelve months in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions. Our liquidity management strategy includes a number of elements, including, but not limited to: Maintaining diversified funding sources (refer to the Funding Strategy section for more details); Maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and off-balance sheet liquidity sources; Projecting cash inflows and outflows under a variety of economic and market scenarios; Establishing clear objectives for liquidity risk management, including compliance with regulatory requirements; and Incorporating liquidity risk management as appropriate into our capital adequacy framework. The amount and type of liquidity resources we maintain can vary over time, based upon the results of stress scenarios required under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and other various regulatory liquidity requirements, such as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio, as well as additional stress scenarios required under our liquidity risk policy. The investment income we receive on liquidity resources, such as cash, is less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances. The net interest costs to maintain these resources have been substantial. The level of future net interest costs depends on the amount of liquidity resources we maintain and the difference between our cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields. Securitized Borrowing Capacity As of September 30, 2018, we maintained a committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility, with a maturity date of July 15, 2020, which gives us the right to sell up to $3.0 billion face amount of eligible AAA notes from the American Express Issuance Trust II (the Charge Trust). We also maintained a committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility, with a maturity date of September 15, 2020, which gives us the right to sell up to $2.0 billion face amount of eligible AAA certificates from the Lending Trust. Both facilities are used in the ordinary course of business to fund seasonal working capital needs, as well as to further enhance our contingent funding resources. As of September 30, 2018, $35 million was drawn on the Charge Trust facility, and no amounts were drawn on the Lending Trust facility. 55 Table of Contents Federal Reserve Discount Window As an insured depository institution, AENB may borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, subject to the amount of qualifying collateral that it may pledge. The Federal Reserve has indicated that both credit and charge card receivables are a form of qualifying collateral for secured borrowings made through the discount window. Whether specific assets will be considered qualifying collateral and the amount that may be borrowed against the collateral, remain at the discretion of the Federal Reserve. We had approximately $76.6 billion as of September 30, 2018 in U.S. credit card loans and charge card receivables that could be sold over time through our securitization trusts or pledged in return for secured borrowings to provide further liquidity, subject in each case to applicable market conditions and eligibility criteria. Committed Bank Credit Facility In addition to the secured borrowing facilities described above, we maintained a committed syndicated bank credit facility as of September 30, 2018 of $3.5 billion, which expires on October 16, 2020. As of September 30, 2018, no amounts were drawn on this facility. Unused Credit Outstanding As of September 30, 2018, we had approximately $300 billion of unused credit outstanding as part of established lending product agreements. Total unused credit does not represent potential future cash requirements, as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn. Our charge card products generally have no pre-set limit, and therefore are not reflected in unused credit available to Card Members. Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the nine months ended September 30: Table 20: Cash Flows (Billions) 2018 2017 Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 10.2 $ 8.6 Investing activities (14.2 ) (8.7 ) Financing activities 1.9 2.6 Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents 0.1 0.3 Net (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ (2.0 ) $ 2.8 Cash Flows from Operating Activities Our cash flows from operating activities primarily include net income adjusted for (i) non-cash items included in net income and (ii) changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities, which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of payments. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was driven by net income adjusted for non-cash items, including changes in provisions for losses, depreciation and amortization, deferred taxes and stock-based compensation, and changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily accounts payable and other liabilities as a result of normal business operations. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Our cash flows from investing activities primarily include changes in Card Member receivables and loans, as well as changes in our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. The increase in net cash used in investing activities was driven by higher growth in Card Member receivables and loans due in part to the acquired Hilton portfolio and a larger net increase in the investment securities portfolio. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Our cash flows from financing activities primarily include changes in long-term debt, short-term borrowings and customer deposits, as well as dividend payments and share repurchases. The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily driven by a lower increase in customer deposits, partially offset by a smaller decrease in debt and a lower level of share repurchases. 56 Table of Contents OTHER MATTERS Certain Legislative, Regulatory and Other Developments We are subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world, and the costs of compliance are substantial. In recent years, the financial services industry has been subject to rigorous scrutiny, high regulatory expectations, and a stringent and unpredictable enforcement environment. Reviews to assess compliance with laws and regulations have been and will continue to be a focus of governmental authorities, as well as for the Company itself. Such reviews have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, changes to our practices, products and procedures, substantial restitution to our customers, civil money penalties and increased costs related to regulatory oversight, supervision and examination. We have also been subject to regulatory actions and may continue to be the subject of such actions, including governmental inquiries, investigations and enforcement proceedings, in the event of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with laws or regulations. For example, we have been cooperating with certain governmental authorities that have requested information from, or served subpoenas on, us, seeking information relating to a small, specialized part of our business, known as foreign exchange international payments (FXIP), which offers cross-border payments services primarily to small and middle market business customers in five countries, including the United States. In particular, we received investigative subpoenas from both the civil and criminal divisions of the U.S. Department of Justice as well as inquiries from the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and others. FXIP accounts for less than one half of one percent of our total revenue net of interest expense and is unrelated to our card businesses. Relatedly, we are conducting a review with an outside law firm of FXIP pricing practices. We do not believe this matter will have a material adverse impact on our operations or results. Please see the Supervision and Regulation and Risk Factors sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 (the 2017 Form 10-K) for further information. Payments Regulation Legislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the operation of card networks, including through antitrust actions, legislation and regulations to change certain practices or pricing of card issuers, merchant acquirers and payment networks, and, in some cases, to establish broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes for payment systems. The European Union, Australia and other jurisdictions have focused on the fees merchants pay to accept cards, including the way bankcard network members collectively set the interchange (that is, the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in four party networks like Visa and Mastercard), as well as the rules, contract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance. Although, unlike the Visa and Mastercard networks, we do not have interchange fees, regulation relating to merchant pricing or terms of merchant rules and contracts could affect all networks directly or indirectly, as well as adversely impact consumers and merchants. Among other things, regulation of bankcard fees has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact the discount revenue derived from our business, including as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees. In some cases, such regulation extends to certain aspects of our business. For more information on the European Union and Australian payments regulation, as well as the potential impacts on our results of operations and business, please see the Supervision and Regulation and Risk Factors sections of the 2017 Form 10-K. Broad regulatory oversight over payment systems can also include, in some cases, requirements for international card networks to localize aspects of their operations, such as processing infrastructure and data storage, which could increase our costs and diminish the value of our closed loop. The development and enforcement of payment system regulatory regimes generally continue to grow and may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and maintain and extend our global network. 57 Table of Contents Surcharging In certain countries, such as certain Member States in the European Union and Australia, merchants are permitted by law to surcharge card purchases. While surcharging continues to be actively considered in certain jurisdictions, the benefits to customers have not been apparent in countries that have allowed it, and in some cases regulators are addressing concerns about excessive surcharging by merchants. For example, the Reserve Bank of Australia amended its rules to limit surcharging in Australia to the actual cost of card acceptance paid to the merchant acquirer. Surcharging, particularly where it disproportionately impacts American Express Card Members, which is known as differential surcharging, as well as other steering practices that are permitted by regulation in some countries, could have a material adverse effect on us if it becomes widespread. As revisions to the Payment Services Directive in the European Union are transposed into national law by each Member State, there may be increased instances of differential surcharging of our cards, customer and merchant confusion as to which transactions may be surcharged and Card Member dissatisfaction. In addition, the laws of a number of states in the United States that prohibit surcharging are being challenged in litigation brought by merchant groups and some such laws have been struck down. For more information on the potential impacts of surcharging and other actions that could impair the Card Member experience, please see the Risk Factors section of the 2017 Form 10-K. Consumer Financial Products Regulation In the United States, our marketing, sale and servicing of consumer financial products and our compliance with certain federal consumer financial laws are supervised and examined by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, which has broad rulemaking and enforcement authority over providers of credit, savings and payment services and products and authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices. In addition, a number of U.S. states have significant consumer credit protection, disclosure and other laws (in certain cases more stringent than U.S. federal laws). U.S. federal law also regulates abusive debt collection practices, which along with bankruptcy and debtor relief laws, can affect our ability to collect amounts owed to us or subject us to regulatory scrutiny. For more information on consumer financial products regulation, as well as the potential impacts on our results of operations and business, please see the Supervision and Regulation and Risk Factors sections of the 2017 Form 10-K. Antitrust Litigation The U.S. Department of Justice and certain states attorneys general brought an action against us in 2010 alleging that the provisions in our card acceptance agreements with merchants that prohibit merchants from engaging in various actions to discriminate against our card products violate the U.S. antitrust laws. On June 25, 2018, the Supreme Court found in favor of American Express in that case. We continue to vigorously defend similar antitrust claims initiated by merchants in court and arbitration proceedings. See Part II, Item 1. Legal Proceedings below and the Legal Proceedings section in our 2017 Form 10-K for descriptions of the cases. It is possible that actions impairing the Card Member experience, or the resolution of one or any combination of these merchant claims for damages, could have a material adverse effect on our business. For more information on the potential impacts of an adverse decision in the merchant litigations on our business, please see the Risk Factors section of the 2017 Form 10-K. Privacy, Data Protection, Information and Cyber Security Regulatory and legislative activity in the areas of privacy, data protection and information and cyber security continues to increase worldwide. We have established and continue to maintain policies that provide a framework for compliance with applicable laws, meet evolving customer expectations and support and enable business innovation and growth. Global financial institutions like us have experienced a significant increase in information and cyber security risk in recent years and will likely continue to be the target of increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks, including computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, ransomware, social engineering attacks (including phishing and impersonation), hacking, denial-of-service attacks and other attacks and similar disruptions from the unauthorized use of or access to computer systems.

Glossary of Selected Terminology Adjusted net interest income A non-GAAP measure that represents net interest income attributable to our Card Member loans (which includes, on a GAAP basis, interest that is deemed uncollectible), excluding the impact of interest expense and interest income not attributable to our Card Member loans. We believe adjusted net interest income is useful to investors because it represents the interest expense and interest income attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio and it is a component of net interest yield on average Card Member loans. Asset securitizations Asset securitization involves the transfer and sale of loans or receivables to a special-purpose entity created for the securitization activity, typically a trust. The trust, in turn, issues securities, commonly referred to as asset-backed securities that are secured by the transferred loans and receivables. The trust uses the proceeds from the sale of such securities to pay the purchase price for the underlying loans or receivables. The loans and receivables of our Lending Trust and Charge Trust (collectively, the Trusts) securitized are reported as assets and the securities issued by the Trusts are reported as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Average discount rate This calculation is generally designed to reflect the average pricing at all merchants accepting American Express cards and represents the percentage of proprietary and GNS billed business retained by us from merchants we acquire, or from merchants acquired by third parties on our behalf, net of amounts retained by such third parties. Billed business Represents transaction volumes (including cash advances) on cards and other payment products issued by American Express (proprietary billed business) and cards issued under network partnership agreements with banks and other institutions, including joint ventures (GNS billed business). In-store spending activity within GNS retail cobrand portfolios, from which we earn no revenue, is not included in billed business. Billed business is reported as in the United States or outside the United States based on the location of the issuer. Capital ratios Represents the minimum standards established by the regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether the regulated entity has sufficient capital to absorb on- and off-balance sheet losses beyond current loss accrual estimates. Refer to the Capital Strategy section under Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity for further related definitions under Basel III. Cards-in-force Represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding by American Express (proprietary cards-in-force) and cards issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements with banks and other institutions, including joint ventures (GNS cards-in-force), except for GNS retail cobrand cards that have no out of store spend activity during the prior 12 months. Basic cards-in-force excludes supplemental cards issued on consumer accounts. Card Member The individual holder of an issued American Express-branded charge, credit and certain prepaid cards. Card Member loans Represents the outstanding amount due from Card Members for charges made on their American Express credit cards, as well as any interest charges and card-related fees. Card Member loans also include revolving balances on certain American Express charge card products. Card Member receivables Represents the outstanding amount due from Card Members for charges made on their American Express charge cards, as well as any card-related fees, other than revolving balances on certain American Express charge cards with Pay Over Time features. Such revolving balances are included within Card Member loans. Charge cards Represents cards that generally carry no pre-set spending limits and are primarily designed as a method of payment and not as a means of financing purchases. Charge Card Members generally must pay the full amount billed each month. No finance charges are assessed on charge cards. Each charge card transaction is authorized based on its likely economics reflecting a Card Member most recent credit information and spend patterns. Some charge card accounts have additional Pay Over Time feature(s) that allow revolving of certain charges. Cobrand cards Cards issued under cobrand agreements with selected commercial firms. Pursuant to the cobrand agreements, we make payments to our cobrand partners, which can be significant, based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained. In some cases, the partner is liable for providing rewards to the Card Member under the cobrand partner own loyalty program. 59 Table of Contents Credit cards Represents cards that have a range of revolving payment terms, grace periods, and rate and fee structures. Discount revenue Represents revenue earned from fees generally charged to merchants who have entered into a card acceptance agreement. The discount fee generally is deducted from our payment for Card Member purchases. Interest expense Includes interest incurred primarily to fund Card Member loans and receivables, general corporate purposes and liquidity needs, and is recognized as incurred. Interest expense is divided principally into two categories: (i) deposits, which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions, and (ii) debt, which primarily relates to interest expense on our long-term financing and short-term borrowings (e.g., commercial paper, federal funds purchased, bank overdrafts and other short-term borrowings), as well as the realized impact of derivatives hedging interest rate risk on our long-term debt. Interest income Includes (i) interest on loans, (ii) interest and dividends on investment securities and (iii) interest income on deposits with banks and other. Interest on loans Assessed using the average daily balance method for Card Member loans. Unless the loan is classified as non-accrual, interest is recognized based upon the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the terms of the applicable account agreement until the outstanding balance is paid or written off. Interest and dividends on investment securities Primarily relates to our performing fixed-income securities. Interest income is recognized as earned using the effective interest method, which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts, fees and other payments, so a constant rate of return is recognized on the outstanding balance of the related investment security throughout its term. Amounts are recognized until securities are in default or when it is likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled. Interest income on deposits with banks and other Recognized as earned, and primarily relates to the placement of cash in excess of near-term funding requirements in interest-bearing time deposits, overnight sweep accounts, and other interest-bearing demand and call accounts. Liquidity Coverage Ratio Represents the minimum standards established by regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether the regulated entity has sufficient liquidity to meet liquidity needs in periods of financial and economic stress. Merchant acquisition Represents our process of entering into agreements with merchants to accept American Express-branded cards. Net card fees Represents the card membership fees earned during the period. These fees are recognized as revenue over the covered card membership period (typically one year), net of the provision for projected refunds for card membership cancellation and deferred acquisition costs. Net interest yield on average Card Member loans A non-GAAP measure that is computed by dividing adjusted net interest income by average Card Member loans, computed on an annualized basis. Reserves and net write-offs related to uncollectible interest are recorded through provisions for losses, and are thus not included in the net interest yield calculation. We believe net interest yield on average Card Member loans is useful to investors because it provides a measure of profitability of our Card Member loan portfolio. Net loss ratio Represents the ratio of GCP charge card write-offs, consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions) and fee components, less recoveries, on Card Member receivables expressed as a percentage of gross amounts billed to corporate Card Members. Net write-off rate principal only Represents the amount of proprietary consumer or small business Card Member loans or receivables written off, consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions), less recoveries, as a percentage of the average loan or receivables balance during the period. Net write-off rate principal, interest and fees Includes, in the calculation of the net write-off rate, amounts for interest and fees in addition to principal for Card Member loans and fees in addition to principal for Card Member receivables. Operating expenses Represents salaries and employee benefits, professional services, occupancy and equipment, and other expenses. Return on average equity Calculated by dividing one-year period net income by one-year average total shareholders equity. 60 Table of Contents
