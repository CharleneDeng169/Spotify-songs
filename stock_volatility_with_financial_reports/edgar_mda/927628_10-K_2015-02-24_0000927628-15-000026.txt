Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A ) This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based upon management current expectations and are subject to significant uncertainties and changes in circumstances. Please review Forward-Looking Statements for more information on the forward-looking statements in this 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K ( this Report ). Our actual results may differ materially from those included in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to, those described in Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Report. Unless otherwise specified, references to notes to our consolidated financial statements refer to the notes to our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2014 included in this Report. Management monitors a variety of key indicators to evaluate our business results and financial condition. The following MD&A is intended to provide the reader with an understanding of our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity by focusing on changes from year to year in certain key measures used by management to evaluate performance, such as profitability, growth and credit quality metrics. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014 and accompanying notes. MD&A is organized in the following sections: Executive Summary and Business Outlook Capital Management Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Risk Management Accounting Changes and Developments Credit Risk Profile Consolidated Results of Operations Liquidity Risk Profile Business Segment Financial Performance Market Risk Profile Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis Supplemental Tables Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Variable Interest Entities Glossary and Acronyms EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND BUSINESS OUTLOOK In 2014, all three of our business segments delivered strong underlying performance and grew our loan portfolios. We continue to deliver risk-adjusted returns while investing to improve profitability. We remain focused on creating value and sustained performance. Financial Highlights We reported net income of $4.4 billion ( $7.59 per diluted common share) on total net revenue of $22.3 billion for 2014 , with each of our three business segments contributing to our earnings. In comparison, we reported net income of $4.1 billion ( $6.89 per diluted common share) on total net revenue of $22.4 billion for 2013 and $3.5 billion ( $6.11 per diluted share) on total net revenue of $21.4 billion for 2012 . Beginning on January 1, 2014, we calculate our regulatory capital under the Basel III Standardized Approach subject to transition provisions. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, as calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach, including transition provisions, was 12.46% as of December 31, 2014 . Our Tier 1 common ratio, as calculated under Basel I, was 12.19% as of December 31, 2013 . These numbers are not directly comparable due to methodological differences in the calculation of the ratios. We formally entered parallel run for Basel III Advanced Approaches as of January 1, 2015. See Capital Management below for additional information. On March 26, 2014, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of shares of our common stock ( 2014 Stock Repurchase Program ). During 2014, we repurchased approximately $2.0 billion of common stock and expect to complete the 2014 Stock Repurchase Program by the end of the first quarter of 2015. See Capital Management below for additional information. Below are additional highlights of our performance in 2014 . These highlights generally are based on a comparison between the results of 2014 and 2013 , except as otherwise noted. The changes in our financial condition and credit performance are generally based on our financial condition and credit performance as of December 31, 2014 compared to our financial condition and credit 35 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents performance as of December 31, 2013 . We provide a more detailed discussion of our financial performance in the sections following this Executive Summary and Business Outlook . Total Company Earnings: Our net income increased by $307 million , or 7% , to $4.4 billion in 2014 , compared to $4.1 billion in 2013 . The increase in net income was driven by (i) a $342 million change driven by a net benefit of $33 million for mortgage representation and warranty losses (which includes a benefit of $26 million before taxes in continuing operations and a benefit of $7 million before taxes in discontinued operations) in 2014 , as compared to a net provision of $309 million (which includes a benefit of $24 million before taxes in continuing operations and a provision of $333 million before taxes in discontinued operations) in 2013 ; (ii) a decrease in non-interest expense due to lower amortization of intangibles, acquisition-related costs and the provision for litigation matters; and (iii) an increase in net interest income due to lower funding costs. These items were partially offset by a decrease in net interest income attributable to the Portfolio Sale and higher marketing expenses associated with loan growth. Loans Held for Investment: Period-end loans held for investment increased by $11.1 billion , or 6% , to $208.3 billion as of December 31, 2014 from $197.2 billion as of December 31, 2013 . Average loans held for investment increased by $5.3 billion, or 3%, to $197.9 billion in 2014 , compared to $192.6 billion in 2013 . The increases were due to growth in our credit card and commercial loan portfolios, and continued strong auto loan originations outpacing the run-off of the acquired home loan portfolio in our Consumer Banking business. Net Charge-off and Delinquency Statistics: Our net charge-off rate decreased by 32 basis points to 1.72% in 2014 from 2.04% in 2013 . The low net charge-off rates observed during 2014, compared to our historical trends, were largely due to continued economic improvement and portfolio seasoning. Our 30+ day delinquency rate declined to 2.91% as of December 31, 2014 from 2.96% as of December 31, 2013 . The decrease was primarily due to strong credit performance. We provide additional information on our credit quality metrics below under Business Segment Financial Performance and Credit Risk Profile. Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses: Our allowance for loan and lease losses increased by $68 million to $4.4 billion as of December 31, 2014 , from $4.3 billion as of December 31, 2013 . The increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses was primarily driven by loan growth in our domestic card, auto and commercial loan portfolios, in addition to portfolio specific risks in our commercial loan portfolio, offset by credit improvement driving allowance releases related to our international card portfolio. The allowance coverage ratio declined by 9 basis points to 2.10% as of December 31, 2014 from 2.19% as of December 31, 2013 primarily resulting from the increase in the outstanding balances in loans held for investment outpacing the allowance build. Representation and Warranty Reserve: The mortgage representation and warranty reserve decreased by $441 million to $731 million as of December 31, 2014 , from $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2013 . We recorded a net benefit for mortgage representation and warranty losses of $33 million (which includes a benefit of $26 million before taxes in continuing operations and a benefit of $7 million before taxes in discontinued operations) in 2014 . The decrease in the representation and warranty reserve was primarily driven by claims paid and legal developments including settlements. 36 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Business Segment Financial Performance Table 1 summarizes our business segment results, which we report based on income from continuing operations, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.

See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional information. Prior periods have been recast to conform to this presentation. (2) Total net revenue consists of net interest income and non-interest income. (3) Net income (loss) for our business segments is based on income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax. (4) Some of our tax-related commercial investments generate tax-exempt income or tax credits. Accordingly, we make certain reclassifications within our Commercial Banking business results to present revenues and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated assuming an effective tax rate approximately equal to our federal statutory tax rate of 35%. (5) Includes the residual impact of the allocation of certain items, our centralized Corporate Treasury group activities, as well as other items as described in Note 19 Business Segments . Credit Card: Our Credit Card business generated net income from continuing operations of $2.5 billion in 2014 , compared to net income from continuing operations of $2.6 billion in 2013 . The decrease in net income was driven by lower net revenue associated with the Portfolio Sale in 2013, partially offset by a decrease in non-interest expenses and a lower provision for credit losses driven by lower net charge-offs. Period-end loans held for investment in our Credit Card business increased by $4.6 billion to $85.9 billion as of December 31, 2014 from $81.3 billion as of December 31, 2013 . The increase was primarily due to growth in the domestic card loan portfolio in 2014. Consumer Banking: Our Consumer Banking business generated net income from continuing operations of $1.2 billion in 2014 , compared to net income from continuing operations of $1.5 billion in 2013 . The decrease in net income was primarily attributable to compression in deposit spreads in retail banking, declining home loan portfolio balances and margin compression in our auto loan portfolio. The decrease was partially offset by higher net interest income generated by growth in our auto loan portfolio. Period-end loans held for investment in our Consumer Banking business increased by $677 million to $71.4 billion as of December 31, 2014 , from $70.8 billion as of December 31, 2013 , due to growth in our auto loan portfolio outpacing the run-off in our acquired home loan portfolio. Commercial Banking: Our Commercial Banking business generated net income from continuing operations of $659 million in 2014 , compared to net income from continuing operations of $731 million in 2013 . The decrease in net income was primarily due to a higher provision for credit losses, reflecting an allowance build in 2014 compared to an allowance release in 2013. This was partially offset by higher revenue net of related operating expenses, driven by the growth in our commercial loan portfolio, fee-based services and products attributable to the Beech Street business. Period-end loans held for investment in our Commercial Banking business increased by $5.9 billion to $50.9 billion as of December 31, 2014 , from $45.0 billion as of December 31, 2013 . The increase was driven by loan growth in the commercial and industrial and commercial and multifamily real estate portfolios. 37 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Business Outlook We discuss below our current expectations regarding our total company performance and the performance of each of our business segments over the near-term based on market conditions, the regulatory environment and our business strategies as of the time we filed this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The statements contained in this section are based on our current expectations regarding our outlook for our financial results and business strategies. Our expectations take into account, and should be read in conjunction with, our expectations regarding economic trends and analysis of our business as discussed in Part I Item 1. Business and Part II Item 7. MD&A of this Report. Certain statements are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results could differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements. Except as otherwise disclosed, forward-looking statements do not reflect: (i) any change in current dividend or repurchase strategies; (ii) the effect of any acquisitions, divestitures or similar transactions that have not been previously disclosed; or (iii) any changes in laws, regulations or regulatory interpretations, in each case after the date as of which such statements are made. See Part I Item 1. Business Forward Looking Statements in this Report for more information on the forward-looking statements included in this Report and Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Report for factors that could materially influence our results. Total Company Expectations Our strategies and actions are designed to deliver and sustain strong returns and capital generation through the acquisition and retention of franchise-enhancing customer relationships across our businesses. We believe that franchise-enhancing customer relationships create and sustain significant long-term value through low risk-adjusted credit costs, long and loyal customer relationships and a gradual build in loan balances and revenues over time. Examples of franchise-enhancing customer relationships include rewards customers and partnerships in our Credit Card business, retail deposit customers in our Consumer Banking business and primary banking relationships with commercial customers in our Commercial Banking business. We intend to grow these customer relationships by continuing to invest in scalable infrastructure and operating platforms, so that we can meet the heightened risk management expectations facing all banks and deliver a brand-defining customer experience that builds and sustains a valuable, long-term customer franchise. We delivered attractive risk-adjusted returns in 2014, and we expect that will continue. In 2015, we expect growth in full-year revenues, driven by growth in average loans. We also expect that full-year marketing and operating expenses will both be higher in 2015 than they were in 2014. We expect the full-year 2015 efficiency ratio to be between 53.5% and 54.5%, excluding non-recurring items. We also expect that efficiency ratio will vary, perhaps significantly, from quarter to quarter based on factors such as day count, the timing of growth and associated revenues, and the timing of investments throughout the year. We believe our actions have created a well-positioned balance sheet with strong capital and liquidity. Pursuant to our approved 2014 capital plan, we expect to complete our previously announced $2.5 billion 2014 Stock Repurchase Program in the first quarter of 2015. The timing and exact amount of any common stock repurchases will depend on various factors, including market conditions, our capital position and amount of our retained earnings. Our 2014 Stock Repurchase Program does not include specific price targets, may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including utilizing Rule 10b5-1 programs, and may be suspended at any time. See MD&A Capital Management Capital Planning and Regulatory Stress Testing for more information. Business Segment Expectations Credit Card: In our Domestic Card business, we continue to expect the quarterly charge-off rate throughout 2015 to be in the mid-to-high three percent range. We expect normal seasonal patterns throughout the year, including an increase in the charge-off rate in the first quarter of 2015, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. In addition to seasonality, we continue to expect that loan growth will impact the charge-off rate. As new loan balances season, we expect them to put upward pressure on losses. While this impact on the charge-off rate will likely be modest at first, we expect that the impact will grow throughout 2015 and beyond. In addition to rising charge-offs, we expect loan growth to drive allowance additions. We continue to believe that our Domestic Card business continues to be well-positioned. Consumer Banking: In our Consumer Banking business, we continue to experience a change in product mix as a result of continued growth in auto originations and loans offset by the planned run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio. While our auto business remains well-positioned, we remain cautious and continue to closely monitor pricing, underwriting 38 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents practices, used vehicle prices and other competitor and market factors. Returns on new auto originations are lower than returns in the overall auto loan portfolio, but remain resilient and within ranges that support an attractive business. In addition, in our retail banking business, we expect the impact of the prolonged low interest rate environment will continue to pressure returns, even if rates rise in 2015. Commercial Banking: Our Commercial Banking business is well-positioned to navigate current market conditions. Competition in the Commercial Banking business remains intense, pressuring margin and returns. Although we expect the pace of our commercial loan portfolio growth to be slower in 2015, we expect our Commercial Banking business to continue to deliver solid results. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make a number of judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses on the consolidated financial statements. Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We provide a summary of our significant accounting policies under Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . We have identified the following accounting policies as critical because they require significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. These critical accounting policies govern: Loan loss reserves Asset impairment Fair value of financial instruments Representation and warranty reserves Customer rewards reserves We evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and update them, as necessary, based on changing conditions. Management has discussed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Loan Loss Reserves We maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses that represents management estimate of incurred loan and lease losses inherent in our held-for-investment credit card, consumer banking and commercial banking loan portfolios as of each balance sheet date. We also separately reserve for binding unfunded lending commitments, letters of credit and financial guarantees. We build our allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments through the provision for credit losses. Our provision for credit losses in each period is driven by charge-offs, changes to allowance for loan and lease losses, and changes to unfunded lending commitments. We recorded a provision for credit losses of $3.5 billion in both 2014 and 2013 , and $4.4 billion in 2012 . We have an established process, using analytical tools and management judgment, to determine our allowance for loan and lease losses. Losses are inherent in our loan portfolio and we calculate the allowance for loan and lease losses by estimating incurred losses for segments of our loan portfolio with similar risk characteristics and record a provision for credit losses. The allowance totaled $4.4 billion as of December 31, 2014 , compared to $4.3 billion as of December 31, 2013 . We review and assess our allowance methodologies and adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses on a quarterly basis. Our assessment involves evaluating many factors including, but not limited to, historical loss and recovery experience, recent trends in delinquencies and charge-offs, risk ratings, the impact of bankruptcy filings, the value of collateral underlying secured loans, account seasoning, changes in our credit evaluation, underwriting and collection management policies, seasonality, general economic conditions, changes in the legal and regulatory environment and uncertainties in forecasting and modeling techniques 39 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents used in estimating our allowance for loan and lease losses. Key factors that have a significant impact on our allowance for loan and lease losses include assumptions about unemployment rates, home prices, and the valuation of commercial properties and other collateral, consumer real estate, and automobiles. In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we review and assess our estimate of probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments, such as letters of credit and financial guarantees, and unfunded loan commitments on a quarterly basis. The factors impacting our assessment generally align with those considered in our evaluation of the allowance for loan and lease losses for the Commercial Banking business. Changes to the reserve for losses on unfunded lending commitments are recorded through the provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of income and to other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Although we examine a variety of externally available data, as well as our internal loan performance data, to determine our allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments, our estimation process is subject to risks and uncertainties, including a reliance on historical loss and trend information that may not be representative of current conditions and indicative of future performance. Accordingly, our actual credit loss experience may not be in line with our expectations. We provide additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used in determining our allowance for loan and lease losses for each of our loan portfolio segments in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . We provide information on the components of our allowance, disaggregated by impairment methodology, and changes in our allowance in Note 5 Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses . Finance Charge and Fee Reserves Finance charges and fees on credit card loans, net of amounts that we consider uncollectible, are included in loan receivables and revenue when the finance charges and fees are earned. We continue to accrue finance charges and fees on credit card loans until the account is charged-off; however, when we do not expect full payment of billed finance charges and fees, we reduce the balance of our credit card loan receivables by the amount of finance charges and fees billed but not expected to be collected and exclude this amount from revenue. Total net revenue was reduced by $645 million, $796 million and $937 million in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively, for the estimated uncollectible amount of billed finance charges and fees. The finance charge and fee reserve totaled $216 million as of December 31, 2014 , compared to $190 million as of December 31, 2013 . We review and assess the adequacy of the uncollectible finance charge and fee reserve on a quarterly basis. Our methodology for estimating the uncollectible portion of billed finance charges and fees is consistent with the methodology we use to estimate the allowance for incurred losses on the principal portion of our credit card loan receivables. Asset Impairment In addition to our loan portfolio, we review other assets for impairment on a regular basis in accordance with applicable impairment accounting guidance. This process requires significant management judgment and involves various estimates and assumptions. Our investment securities, goodwill and intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total assets excluding loans. Accordingly, below we describe our process for assessing impairment of these assets and the key estimates and assumptions involved in this process. Investment Securities We regularly review our investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ) using both quantitative and qualitative criteria. If we intend to sell a security in an unrealized loss position or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, the entire difference between the amortized cost basis of the security and its fair value is recognized in earnings. If we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost, we evaluate other qualitative criteria to determine whether a credit loss exists. Our evaluation requires significant management judgment and a consideration of many factors, including, but not limited to, the extent and duration of the impairment; the health of and specific prospects for the issuer, including whether the issuer has failed to make scheduled interest or principal payments; recent events specific to the issuer and/or industry to which the issuer belongs; the payment structure of the security; external credit ratings; the value of underlying collateral and current market conditions. Quantitative criteria include assessing whether there has been an adverse change in expected future cash flows. See Note 3 Investment Securities for additional information. 40 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill resulting from business combinations prior to January 1, 2009 represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill resulting from business combinations after January 1, 2009, is generally determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Goodwill totaled $14.0 billion as of both December 31, 2014 and 2013 . Intangible assets, which we report on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other assets, consist primarily of purchased credit card relationships ( PCCR ) and core deposit intangibles. The net carrying amount of intangible assets decreased to $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2014 , from $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2013 . Goodwill and intangible assets together represented 5% of our total assets as of both December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. We did not recognize impairment on goodwill or intangible assets in 2014 , 2013 or 2012 . Goodwill Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, on an annual basis or in interim periods if events or circumstances indicate potential impairment. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below. The goodwill impairment test, performed at October 1 of each year, is a two-step test. The first step identifies whether there is potential impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the second step of the impairment test is required to measure the amount of any potential impairment loss. Estimating the fair value of reporting units and the assets, liabilities and intangible assets of a reporting unit is a subjective process that involves the use of estimates and judgments. The fair value of reporting units is calculated using a discounted cash flow model, a form of the income approach. The model uses projected cash flows based on each reporting unit internal forecast and use the perpetuity growth method to calculate terminal values. These cash flows and terminal values are then discounted using discount rates based on our external cost of equity with adjustments for risk inherent in each reporting unit. Cash flows are adjusted, as necessary, in order to maintain each reporting unit equity capital requirements. Our discounted cash flow analysis requires management to make judgments about future loan and deposit growth, revenue growth, credit losses, and capital rates. Discount rates used in 2014 for the reporting units ranged from 8% to 13% . The key inputs into the discounted cash flow analysis were consistent with market data, where available, indicating that assumptions used were within a reasonable range of observable market data. We do not maintain separate balance sheets at the reporting unit level; therefore, we calculate the carrying amounts of our reporting units using an allocated capital approach based on each reporting unit specific regulatory capital, economic capital requirements, and underlying risks. We compare the total reporting unit carrying amounts to our total consolidated stockholders equity, as discussed further in Note 7 Goodwill and Intangible Assets , to assess the appropriateness of our methodology. If the second step of goodwill impairment testing is required for a reporting unit, we undertake an extensive effort to build the specific reporting unit balance sheet for the test based on applicable accounting guidance. Based on our analysis, the current fair value exceeded the carrying amount of all reporting units as of our annual testing date; therefore, the second step of impairment testing was unnecessary. As part of the annual goodwill impairment test, we also assessed our market capitalization based on the average market price relative to the aggregate fair value of our reporting units and determined any excess fair value in our reporting units at the date of testing. The excess fair value attributed to a reasonable control premium was compared to historical control premiums seen in the industry. Intangible Assets Intangible assets with definitive useful lives are amortized over their estimated lives and evaluated for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset or asset group carrying value may not be fully recoverable. An impairment loss, generally calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying amount of an asset or asset group, is recognized if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset or asset group is less than the corresponding carrying value. See Note 7 Goodwill and Intangible Assets for additional information. 41 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents M ortgage Servicing Rights Mortgage servicing rights ( MSR ) are initially recorded at fair value when mortgage loans are sold or securitized in the secondary market and the right to service these loans is retained for a fee. Subsequently, our consumer MSRs are carried at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair value recognized in non-interest income. Our commercial MSRs are subsequently measured under the amortization method and are periodically evaluated for impairment, which is recognized as a reduction in non-interest income. See Note 7 Goodwill and Intangible Assets and Note 18 Fair Value Measurement for additional information. Fair Value Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date (also referred to as an exit price). The fair value accounting guidance provides a three-level fair value hierarchy for classifying financial instruments. This hierarchy is based on the markets in which the assets or liabilities trade and whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable. Fair value measurement of a financial asset or liability is assigned a level based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2: Observable market-based inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 3: Unobservable inputs The degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted prices in active markets or observable market parameters. When quoted prices and observable data in active markets are not fully available, management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. Changes in market conditions, such as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities, may reduce the availability and reliability of quoted prices or observable data used to determine fair value. We have developed policies and procedures to determine when markets for our financial assets and liabilities are inactive if the level and volume of activity has declined significantly relative to normal conditions. If markets are determined to be inactive, it may be appropriate to adjust price quotes received. When significant adjustments are required to price quotes or inputs, it may be appropriate to utilize an estimate based primarily on unobservable inputs. Significant judgment may be required to determine whether certain financial instruments measured at fair value are classified as Level 2 or Level 3. In making this determination, we consider all available information that market participants use to measure the fair value of the financial instrument, including observable market data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs used. Based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category, judgments are made regarding the significance of the Level 3 inputs to the instruments fair value measurement in its entirety. If Level 3 inputs are considered significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3. The process for determining fair value using unobservable inputs is generally more subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and assumptions. Our financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis represented approximately 13% and 14% of our total assets as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Financial assets for which the fair value was determined using significant Level 3 inputs represented approximately 4% and 8% of these financial instruments as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. We discuss changes in the valuation inputs and assumptions used in determining the fair value of our financial instruments, including the extent to which we have relied on significant unobservable inputs to estimate fair value and our process for corroborating these inputs, in Note 18 Fair Value Measurement . Fair Value Measurement We have a governance framework and a number of key controls that are intended to ensure that our fair value measurements are appropriate and reliable. Our governance framework provides for independent oversight and segregation of duties. Our control processes include review and approval of new transaction types, price verification and review of valuation judgments, methods, models, process controls and results. Groups independent from our trading and investing functions, including our Corporate 42 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Valuations Group ( CVG ), Fair Value Committee ( FVC ) and Model Validation Group, participate in the review and validation process. The fair valuation governance process is set up in a manner that allows the Chairperson of the FVC to escalate valuation disputes that cannot be resolved at the FVC to a more senior committee called the Valuations Advisory Committee ( VAC ) for resolution. The VAC is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and includes other senior management. The VAC is only required to convene to review escalated valuation disputes; however, it met once during 2014 for a general update on the valuation process. The CVG performs periodic verification of fair value measurements to determine if assigned fair values are reasonable. For example, in cases where we rely on third party pricing services to obtain fair value measures, we analyze pricing variances among different pricing sources and validate the final price used by comparing the information to additional sources, including dealer pricing indications in transaction results and other internal sources, where necessary. Additional validation procedures performed by the CVG include reviewing (either directly or indirectly through the reasonableness of assigned fair values) valuation inputs and assumptions, and monitoring acceptable variances between recommended prices and validation prices. The CVG and the Trade Analytics and Valuation team ( TAV ) perform due diligence reviews of the third party pricing services by comparing their prices with prices from other sources and reviewing other control documentation. Additionally, when necessary, the CVG and TAV challenge prices from third-party vendors to ensure reasonableness of prices through a pricing challenge process. This may include a request for a transparency of the assumptions used by the third party. The FVC, which includes representation from business areas, our Risk Management division and our Finance division, is a forum for discussing fair market valuations, inputs, assumptions, methodologies, variance thresholds, valuation control environment and material risks or concerns related to fair market valuations. Additionally, the FVC is empowered to resolve valuation disputes between the primary valuation providers and the CVG. It provides guidance and oversight to ensure an appropriate valuation control environment. The FVC regularly reviews and approves our valuation methodologies to ensure that our methodologies and practices are consistent with industry standards and adhere to regulatory and accounting guidance. The Chief Financial Officer determines when material issues or concerns regarding valuations shall be raised to the Audit Committee or other delegated committee of the Board of Directors. We have a model policy, established by an independent Model Risk Office, which governs the validation of models and related supporting documentation to ensure the appropriate use of models for pricing. The Model Validation Group is part of the Model Risk Office and validates all models and provides ongoing monitoring of their performance, including the validation and monitoring of the performance of all valuation models. Representation and Warranty Reserve In connection with their sales of mortgage loans, certain subsidiaries entered into agreements containing varying representations and warranties about, among other things, the ownership of the loan, the validity of the lien securing the loan, the loan compliance with any applicable loan criteria established by the purchaser, including underwriting guidelines and the ongoing existence of mortgage insurance, and the loan compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws. We may be required to repurchase the mortgage loan, indemnify the investor or insurer, or reimburse the investor for loan and lease losses incurred on the loan in the event of a material breach of contractual representations or warranties. We have established representation and warranty reserves for losses that we consider to be both probable and reasonably estimable associated with the mortgage loans sold by each subsidiary, including both litigation and non-litigation liabilities. The reserve-setting process relies heavily on estimates, which are inherently uncertain, and requires the application of judgment. In establishing the representation and warranty reserves, we rely on historical data and consider a variety of factors, depending on the category of purchaser. These factors include, but are not limited to, the historical relationship between loan losses and repurchase outcomes; the percentage of current and future loan defaults that we anticipate will result in repurchase requests over the lifetime of the loans; the percentage of those repurchase requests that we anticipate will result in actual repurchases; and estimated collateral valuations. We evaluate these factors and update our loss forecast models on a quarterly basis to estimate our lifetime liability. Our aggregate representation and warranty mortgage reserve, which we report as a component of other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, totaled $731 million and $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. The adequacy of the reserve and the ultimate amount of losses incurred by us or one of our subsidiaries will depend on, among other things, actual future mortgage loan performance, the actual level of future repurchase and indemnification requests, the actual success rates of claimants, developments in litigation, actual recoveries on the collateral and macroeconomic conditions (including unemployment levels and housing prices). 43 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents As part of our business planning processes, we have considered various outcomes relating to the potential future representation and warranty liabilities of our subsidiaries that are possible but do not rise to the level of being both probable and reasonably estimable outcomes justifying an incremental accrual under applicable accounting standards. Our current best estimate of reasonably possible future losses from representation and warranty claims beyond what was in our reserve as of December 31, 2014 is approximately $2.1 billion , a decline from our estimate of $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2013 . Notwithstanding our ongoing attempts to estimate a reasonably possible amount of future losses beyond our current accrual levels based on current information, it is possible that actual future losses will exceed both the current accrual level and our current estimate of the amount of reasonably possible losses. This estimate involves considerable judgment, and reflects that there is still significant uncertainty regarding the numerous factors that may impact the ultimate loss levels, including, but not limited to, anticipated litigation outcomes, future repurchase and indemnification claim levels, ultimate repurchase and indemnification rates, future mortgage loan performance levels, actual recoveries on the collateral and macroeconomic conditions (including unemployment levels and housing prices). In light of the significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability our subsidiaries may incur from these matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period. See Note 20 Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others for additional information. Customer Rewards Reserve We offer products, primarily credit cards, which provide reward program members with various rewards, such as cash, statement credits, gift cards, airline tickets or merchandise. The majority of our rewards do not expire and there is no limit on the number of reward points an eligible card member can earn. Customer rewards costs, which we generally record as an offset to interchange income, are driven by various factors, such as card member charge volume, customer participation in the rewards program and contractual arrangements with redemption partners. We establish a customer rewards reserve that reflects management judgment regarding rewards earned that are expected to be redeemed and the estimated redemption cost. We use financial models to estimate ultimate redemption rates of rewards earned to date by current card members based on historical redemption trends, current enrollee redemption behavior, card product type, year of program enrollment, enrollment tenure and card spend levels. Our current assumption is that the vast majority of all rewards earned will eventually be redeemed. We use a weighted-average cost per reward redeemed during the previous twelve months, adjusted as appropriate for recent changes in redemption costs, including mix of rewards redeemed, to estimate future redemption costs. We continually evaluate our reserve and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns, cost per point redeemed, contract changes and other factors. Changes in the ultimate redemption rate and weighted-average cost per point have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the reserve through the current period provision by an amount estimated to cover the cost of all points previously earned but not yet redeemed by card members as of the end of the reporting period. We recognized customer rewards expense of $2.0 billion, $1.6 billion and $1.3 billion in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. Our customer rewards liability, which is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, totaled $2.7 billion and $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. ACCOUNTING CHANGES AND DEVELOPMENTS Accounting for Investments in Qualified Affordable Housing Projects In January 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued guidance permitting an entity to account for Investments in Qualified Affordable Housing Projects using the proportional amortization method, if certain criteria are met. The proportional method amortizes the cost of the investment over the period in which the investor expects to receive tax credits and other tax benefits, and the resulting amortization is recognized as a component of income taxes attributable to continuing operations. Historically, these investments were accounted for under the equity method and the passive losses related to the investments were recognized within non-interest expense. We adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2014 with retrospective application. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for more information. 44 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The section below provides a comparative discussion of our consolidated financial performance for 2014 , 2013 and 2012 . Following this section, we provide a discussion of our business segment results. You should read this section together with our Executive Summary and Business Outlook where we discuss trends and other factors that we expect will affect our future results of operations. Net Interest Income Net interest income represents the difference between the interest income, including certain fees, earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense on our interest-bearing liabilities. Interest-earning assets include loans, investment securities and other interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing deposits, securitized debt obligations, senior and subordinated notes, and other borrowings. Generally, we include in interest income any past due fees on loans that we deem collectible. Our net interest margin, based on our consolidated results, represents the difference between the yield on our interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities, including the notional impact of non-interest bearing funding. We expect net interest income and our net interest margin to fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 45 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 2 below presents, for each major category of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the average outstanding balances, interest income earned, interest expense incurred, average yield and rate for 2014 , 2013 and 2012 .

See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional information. Prior periods have been recast to conform to this presentation. (2) Past due fees included in interest income totaled approximately $1.4 billion in 2014 , and $1.7 billion in both 2013 and 2012 . (3) Interest income and interest expense and the calculation of average yields on interest-earning assets and average rates on interest-bearing liabilities include the impact of hedge accounting. 46 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Net interest income decreased by $288 million , or 2% , to $17.8 billion in 2014 , compared to $18.1 billion in 2013. These decreases were primarily driven by the Portfolio Sale in 2013, partially offset by growth in commercial, auto and credit card loan portfolios, lower funding costs and higher yielding investment securities in 2014. Average Interest-Earning Assets: The increase in average interest-earning assets in 2014 , compared to 2013 , was due to continued strong growth in commercial, auto and credit card loans (excluding the impact from the Portfolio sale in 2013), partially offset by the run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio within our Consumer Banking business. The decrease in average investment securities was due to sales and paydowns outpacing purchases. Net Interest Margin: The decrease in our net interest margin in 2014 , compared to 2013 , was primarily due to lower average loan yields driven by the Portfolio Sale in 2013 and a shift in the mix of the loan portfolio to lower yielding commercial and auto loans, partially offset by a reduction in our cost of funds and higher yielding investment securities. Net interest income increased by $1.5 billion, or 9%, to $18.1 billion in 2013 , compared to $16.6 billion in 2012. The increases were primarily driven by higher average interest-earning assets, lower funding costs and higher yielding investment securities in 2013. Average Interest-Earning Assets: The increase in average interest-earning assets in 2013, compared to 2012, reflects the full year impact of loans and investment securities from the ING Direct acquisition and the addition of loans from the 2012 U.S. card acquisition. Growth in average interest-earning assets was also driven by continued strong growth in commercial and auto loans, which was partially offset by the run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio in our Consumer Banking business, the expected run-off of higher-margin, higher-loss receivables acquired in the 2012 U.S. card acquisition and installment loans in our Credit Card business, as well as the Portfolio Sale in the third quarter of 2013. Net Interest Margin: The increase in our net interest margin in 2013, compared to 2012, was primarily attributable to a reduction in our cost of funds, which was due in part to the redemption of $3.65 billion of our trust preferred securities on January 2, 2013, which generally carried a higher coupon than other funding sources available to us. Our lowered cost of funds also reflects the continued benefit from the shift in the mix of our funding to lower cost consumer and commercial banking deposits from higher cost wholesale sources and a decline in deposit interest rates as a result of the continued overall low interest rate environment. 47 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 3 displays the change in our net interest income between periods and the extent to which the variance is attributable to: (i) changes in the volume of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities; or (ii) changes in the interest rates related to these assets and liabilities. Table 3 : Rate/Volume Analysis of Net Interest Income (1) 2014 vs. 2013 2013 vs. 2012 (Dollars in millions) Total Variance Volume Rate Total Variance Volume Rate Interest income: Loans: Credit card $ (741 ) $ (576 ) $ (165 ) $ 726 $ 408 $ 318 Consumer banking 19 (93 ) 112 (88 ) 37 (125 ) Commercial banking 62 251 (189 ) 59 190 (131 ) Other 100 (9 ) 109 (19 ) 4 (23 ) Total loans, including loans held for sale (560 ) (427 ) (133 ) 678 639 39 Investment securities 53 (24 ) 77 246 147 99 Cash equivalents and other interest-earning assets 6 (1 ) 7 10 (35 ) 45 Total interest income (501 ) (452 ) (49 ) 934 751 183 Interest expense: Deposits (153 ) (43 ) (110 ) (162 ) 33 (195 ) Securitized debt obligations (38 ) (38 ) (88 ) (61 ) (27 ) Senior and subordinated notes (16 ) 74 (90 ) (30 ) 41 (71 ) Other borrowings and liabilities (6 ) (8 ) 2 (303 ) 44 (347 ) Total interest expense (213 ) 23 (236 ) (583 ) 57 (640 ) Net interest income $ (288 ) $ (475 ) $ 187 $ 1,517 $ 694 $ 823 __________ (1) We calculate the change in interest income and interest expense separately for each item. The portion of interest income or interest expense attributable to both volume and rate is allocated proportionately when the calculation results in a positive value. When the portion of interest income or interest expense attributable to both volume and rate results in a negative value, the total amount is allocated to volume or rate, depending on which amount is positive. Non-Interest Income Non-interest income primarily consists of interchange income net of rewards expense, service charges and other customer-related fees, other non-interest income and, in 2012 , the bargain purchase gain attributable to the ING Direct acquisition in the amount of $594 million. Other non-interest income includes the pre-tax net benefit (provision) for mortgage representation and warranty losses related to continuing operations. It also includes gains and losses from the sale of investment securities, gains and losses on derivatives not accounted for in hedge accounting relationships, and hedge ineffectiveness, which we generally do not allocate to our business segments because they relate to centralized asset/liability and market risk management activities undertaken by our Corporate Treasury group. 48 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 4 displays the components of non-interest income for 2014 , 2013 and 2012 . Table 4 : Non-Interest Income Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2014 2013 2012 Service charges and other customer-related fees $ 1,867 $ 2,118 $ 2,106 Interchange fees, net 2,021 1,896 1,647 Bargain purchase gain (1) 594 Net other-than-temporary impairment recognized in earnings (24 ) (41 ) (52 ) Other non-interest income: Benefit (provision) for mortgage representation and warranty losses (2) 26 24 (42 ) Net gains from the sale of investment securities 21 7 45 Net fair value gains (losses) on free-standing derivatives (3) 52 3 (36 ) Other (4) 509 271 545 Total other non-interest income 608 305 512 Total non-interest income $ 4,472 $ 4,278 $ 4,807 __________ (1) Represents the amount by which the fair value of the net assets acquired in the ING Direct acquisition, as of the acquisition date, exceeded the consideration transferred. (2) Represents the benefit (provision) for mortgage representation and warranty losses recorded in continuing operations. For the total impact to the net benefit (provision) for mortgage representation and warranty losses, including the portion recognized in our consolidated statements of income as a component of discontinued operations, see MD&A Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis Table 13 : Changes in Representation and Warranty Reserve. (3) Includes mark-to-market derivative losses of $78 million in 2012 related to interest-rate swaps we entered into in 2011 to partially hedge the interest rate risk of the net assets associated with the ING Direct acquisition. (4) Includes income of $162 million in 2012 related to the sale of Visa stock shares. Non-interest income increased by $194 million , or 5% , to $4.5 billion in 2014 , compared to $4.3 billion in 2013 . The main drivers for the increase in non-interest income were an increase in interchange fees, net, due to strong purchase volume in our credit card loan portfolio, partially offset by a decline in our service charges and other customer-related fees due to strategic choices we made related to our Domestic Card business. Non-interest income decreased by $529 million , or 11% , to $4.3 billion in 2013, compared to $4.8 billion in 2012. The decrease in non-interest income reflected the combined impact of the absence of the bargain purchase gain of $594 million recognized at acquisition of ING Direct and income of $162 million from the sale of Visa stock shares, both of which were recorded in 2012 . The impact of these items was partially offset by the favorable impact of increased customer related fees and interchange fees from purchase volume growth, due in part to the acquisitions, fee based products and services revenue, a change to a benefit from a provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses and a reduction in fair value losses on free-standing derivatives. Provision for Credit Losses Our provision for credit losses in each period is driven by net charge-offs, changes to the allowance for loan and lease losses and changes to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. We recorded a provision for credit losses of $3.5 billion in both 2014 and 2013 , and a provision for credit losses of $4.4 billion in 2012 . The provision for credit losses as a percentage of net interest income was 19.9% , 19.1% , and 26.6% in 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , respectively. The increase in the provision for credit losses of $88 million in 2014 , from 2013 , was primarily driven by a small allowance build of $68 million in 2014 due to loan growth in our domestic card, auto and commercial portfolios, as compared to a release of $552 million in 2013 due to an improved credit outlook coupled with improvements in delinquency inventories in our domestic card, which were observed in 2014; partially offset by lower net charge-offs of $520 million in 2014, as compared to 2013, mainly due to continued economic improvement and portfolio seasoning in our credit card loan portfolio. The decrease in the provision for credit losses of $962 million in 2013 , from 2012 , was driven by the absence of the provision for credit losses of $1.2 billion recorded in the second quarter of 2012 to establish an allowance for credit card loans acquired in the 49 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents 2012 U.S. card acquisition, and lower provision for credit losses in our non-acquired portfolio as underlying credit improved. This was partially offset by (i) an increase in charge-offs on the portfolio of Acquired Loans, as the Acquired Loans have run-off and have been replaced with originated loans which do not have a credit mark to absorb the charge-offs; (ii) a lower allowance release in our Commercial Banking business due to stabilization of the credit outlook in 2013 compared to 2012; and (iii) higher charge- offs on our auto loan portfolio in our Consumer Banking segment reflecting portfolio growth and increased charge off rates from historically low levels. We provide additional information on the provision for credit losses and changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses within Credit Risk Profile Summary of Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses, Note 4 Loans and Note 5 Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses . For information on the allowance methodology for each of our loan categories, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . Non-Interest Expense Non-interest expense consists of ongoing operating costs, such as salaries and associate benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, professional services, communications and data processing expenses and other miscellaneous expenses, as well as marketing costs, acquisition-related expenses and amortization of intangibles. Table 5 displays the components of non-interest expense for 2014 , 2013 and 2012 . Table 5 : Non-Interest Expense (1)(2) Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2014 2013 2012 Salaries and associate benefits $ 4,593 $ 4,480 $ 3,991 Occupancy and equipment 1,745 1,541 1,358 Marketing 1,561 1,373 1,366 Professional services 1,216 1,347 1,417 Communications and data processing 798 897 807 Amortization of intangibles 532 671 609 Other non-interest expense: Collections 372 470 544 Fraud losses 275 218 190 Bankcard, regulatory and other fee assessments 465 562 525 Other 623 794 990 Other non-interest expense 1,735 2,044 2,249 Total non-interest expense $ 12,180 $ 12,353 $ 11,797 __________ (1) As of January 1, 2014, we adopted the proportional amortization method of accounting for Investments in Qualified Affordable Housing Projects. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional information. Prior periods have been recast to conform to this presentation. (2) Includes acquisition-related costs of $ 64 million , $193 million and $336 million in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. These amounts are comprised of transaction costs, legal and other professional or consulting fees, restructuring costs, and integration expense. Non-interest expense decreased by $173 million , or 1% , to $12.2 billion in 2014 , compared to $12.4 billion in 2013 . The decrease reflects a decline in the amortization of intangibles and a reduction in acquisition-related costs and provision for litigation matters. These were partially offset by (i) higher operating expenses attributable to growth in our commercial and auto loan portfolios; (ii) the change to include auto repossession-related expenses as a component of operating expenses (prior to January 1, 2014 these costs were reported as a component of net charge-offs); and (iii) higher marketing expenses associated with loan growth, partially offset by lower bankcard, regulatory and other fee assessments and communications and data processing expenses. Non-interest expense increased by $556 million , or 5% , to $12.4 billion in 2013 , compared to $11.8 billion in 2012 . The increase reflects higher operating expenses attributable to the acquired businesses and the growth in our auto loan and commercial loan portfolios. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in acquisition-related costs and other non-interest expenses. 50 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Income Taxes We recorded income tax provisions of $2.1 billion ( 32.7 % effective income tax rate), $2.2 billion ( 33.8% effective income tax rate) and $1.5 billion (28.5% effective income tax rate) in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. Our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations varies between periods due, in part, to fluctuations in our pre-tax earnings, which affects the relative tax benefit of tax-exempt income, tax credits and other permanent tax items. The decrease in our effective income tax rate in 2014 , from 2013 , was primarily attributable to increased net tax credits and tax exempt income, and reductions in state rates, partially offset by increased discrete tax expenses. The increase in our effective income tax rate in 2013, from 2012, was primarily attributable to increased pre-tax income, which reduced the relative benefit of tax-exempt income, tax credits and other permanent items, and the absence of discrete tax benefits of $251 million recorded in 2012 for the non-taxable bargain purchase gain of $594 million related to the acquisition of ING Direct, a deferred tax benefit for changes in our state tax position resulting from the 2012 U.S. card acquisition and consolidation of ING Bank, fsb with our existing banking operations, and the resolution of certain tax issues and audits. In comparison, we recorded $16 million of discrete tax expense in 2013 primarily related to adjustments to acquired tax attributes based upon the final tax returns filed, changes to enacted statutory tax rates, and resolution of certain tax issues and audits. Our effective income tax rate, excluding the impact of discrete tax items discussed above, was 32.2% in 2014 and 33.6% in both 2013 and 2012 . The lower effective income tax rate before discrete items in 2014 in comparison to 2013 was primarily due to higher affordable housing and other business tax credits as a percentage of pre-tax earnings. We provide additional information on items affecting our income taxes and effective tax rate under Note 17 Income Taxes . Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax Income (loss) from discontinued operations reflects ongoing costs, which primarily consist of mortgage loan repurchase representation and warranty charges, related to the mortgage origination operations of GreenPoint wholesale mortgage banking unit that we closed in 2007. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $5 million in 2014 , compared to a loss from discontinued operations of $233 million and $217 million in 2013 and 2012 , respectively. We recorded a total pre-tax benefit for mortgage representation and warranty losses of $7 million ( $4 million net of tax) in 2014 , compared to a pre-tax provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses of $333 million ($210 million net of tax) in 2013 and $307 million ($194 million net of tax) in 2012 . We provide additional information on the net provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses and the related reserve for representation and warranty claims in Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis Mortgage Representation and Warranty Reserve and Note 20 Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others . BUSINESS SEGMENT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE Our principal operations are currently organized into three major business segments, which are defined based on the products and services provided or the type of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability management by our centralized Corporate Treasury group, are included in the Other category. The results of our individual businesses, which we report on a continuing operations basis, reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources. We may periodically change our business segments or reclassify business segment results based on modifications to our management reporting methodologies and changes in organizational alignment. Our business segment results are intended to reflect each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. We use an internal management and reporting process to derive our business segment results. Our internal management and reporting process employs various allocation methodologies, including funds transfer pricing, to assign certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses directly or indirectly attributable to each business segment. Total interest income and net fees are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported. The net interest income of each segment reflects the results of our funds transfer pricing process, which is primarily based on a matched maturity method that takes into consideration market rates. Our funds transfer pricing process provides a funds credit for sources 51 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents of funds, such as deposits generated by our Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking businesses, and a funds charge for the use of funds by each segment. The allocation process is unique to each business segment and acquired businesses. We regularly assess the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, which may result in the implementation of refinements or changes in future periods. We refer to the business segment results derived from our internal management accounting and reporting process as our managed presentation, which differs in some cases from our reported results prepared based on U.S. GAAP. There is no comprehensive authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to U.S. GAAP; therefore, the managed presentation of our business segment results may not be comparable to similar information provided by other financial service companies. In addition, our individual business segment results should not be used as a substitute for comparable results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Below we summarize our business segment results for 2014 , 2013 and 2012 and provide a comparative discussion of these results. We also discuss changes in our financial condition and credit performance statistics as of December 31, 2014 compared to December 31, 2013 . We provide a reconciliation of our total business segment results to our reported consolidated results in Note 19 Business Segments . Additionally, we provide information on the outlook for each of our business segments as described above under Executive Summary and Business Outlook. Credit Card Business The primary sources of revenue for our Credit Card business are interest income, fees collected from customers and interchange fees. Expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating costs such as salaries and associate benefits, occupancy and equipment, professional services, communications and data processing expenses and marketing expenses. Rewards costs are generally netted against interchange fees. Our Credit Card business generated net income from continuing operations of $2.5 billion , $2.6 billion and $1.5 billion in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. 52 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 6 summarizes the financial results of our Credit Card business, which is comprised of Domestic Card and International Card, and displays selected key metrics for the periods indicated.

The estimated uncollectible amount of billed finance charges and fees is reflected as a reduction in revenue and is not included in our net charge-offs. Total net revenue was reduced by $645 million , $796 million and $937 million in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively, for the estimated uncollectible amount of billed finance charges and fees. The finance charge and fee reserve totaled $216 million and $190 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.

The decrease in net interest income was primarily driven by the Portfolio Sale in the third quarter of 2013. Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income was $3.3 billion in both 2014 and 2013 . During 2014 there was an increase in interchange fees, net driven by higher purchase volumes, offset by a reduction in service charges and other customer-related fees due to strategic choices we made in our Domestic Card business. Provision for Credit Losses: The provision for credit losses decreased by $74 million , or 3% , to $2.8 billion in 2014 . The decrease was due to lower net charge-offs, partially offset by an absence of a release in the allowance for loan and lease losses that was incurred in 2013 related to the domestic card loan portfolio. Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense decreased by $376 million , or 5% , to $7.1 billion in 2014 , compared to $7.4 billion in 2013 . The decrease was largely due to (i) lower acquisition related costs; (ii) lower operating expenses driven by the Portfolio Sale; (iii) operating efficiencies; and (iv) lower provision for litigation matters; partially offset by higher marketing expenses. Non-interest expense also included PCCR intangible amortization of $369 million in 2014 , compared to $434 million in 2013 . Loans Held for Investment: Period-end loans held for investment increased by $4.6 billion , or 6% , to $85.9 billion as of December 31, 2014 , from $81.3 billion as of December 31, 2013 . This increase was primarily driven by growth in the domestic card loan portfolio. Average loans held for investment decreased by $261 million, or less than 1%, to $78.9 billion in 2014 , compared to $79.2 billion in 2013 due to the run-off of certain loans acquired in the 2012 U.S. card acquisition, as well as the Portfolio Sale in 2013, partially offset by growth in the second half of 2014. Net Charge-off and Delinquency Statistics: Our net charge-off rate decreased to 3.46% in 2014 , compared to 4.15% in 2013 , largely due to continued economic improvement and portfolio seasoning. The 30+ day delinquency rate decreased to 3.30% as of December 31, 2014 , compared to 3.54% as of December 31, 2013 , due to lower delinquency inventories. Key factors affecting the results of our Credit Card business for 2013, compared to 2012, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 include the following: Net Interest Income: Net interest income increased by $785 million, or 8%, to $11.0 billion in 2013, compared to $10.2 billion in 2012. The increase in net interest income is primarily driven by (i) higher average yield on loans held for investment; (ii) the increase in interest and non-interest income in 2013 due to the full year impact of 2012 U.S. card acquisition; and (iii) the absence of the charge recorded in the second quarter of 2012 to establish the finance charge and fee reserve for the loans acquired in the 2012 U.S card acquisition. The higher average yield on loans held for investment was driven largely by the transfer of the Best Buy loan portfolio to the loans held for sale category in the first quarter of 2013. This was partially offset by a decrease in average loans held for investment due to the Portfolio Sale and expected continued run-off of our installment loan portfolio and other credit card loans acquired in the 2012 U.S. card acquisition. Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income increased by $242 million, or 8%, to $3.3 billion in 2013, compared to $3.1 billion in 2012. The increase was primarily driven by higher net interchange fees from growth in purchase volume due in part to the 2012 U.S. card acquisition. Purchase volume increased by $20.5 billion, or 11%, in 2013. Other factors included increased customer-related fees from the addition of acquired credit card accounts and the absence of charges incurred in the first and second quarters of 2012 for expected refunds to customers affected by certain cross-sell sales practices in our Domestic Card business. Provision for Credit Losses: The provision for credit losses related to our Credit Card business decreased by $1.3 billion, or 30%, to $2.8 billion in 2013, compared to $4.1 billion in 2012. The decrease was primarily driven by the absence of the provision for credit losses of $1.2 billion recorded in the second quarter of 2012 to establish an allowance for credit card loans acquired in the 2012 U.S. card acquisition. Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense increased by $585 million, or 9%, to $7.4 billion in 2013, compared to $6.9 billion in 2012. The increase was largely due to higher operating expenses resulting from the 2012 U.S. card acquisition. This includes PCCR intangible amortization expense of $434 million in 2013, compared to $350 million in 2012. 54 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Loans Held for Investment : Period-end loans held for investment in our Credit Card business decreased by $10.5 billion, or 11%, to $81.3 billion as of December 31, 2013, from $91.8 billion as of December 31, 2012, and average loans held for investment decreased by $802 million, or 1%, to $79.2 billion in 2013 , compared to $80.0 billion in 2012. The decreases were due in part to the Portfolio Sale in 2013, as well as the expected continued run-off of our installment loan portfolio and certain other credit card loans acquired in the 2012 U.S. card acquisition, partially offset by growth in certain other credit card segments. Net Charge-off and Delinquency Statistics: Our net charge-off rate increased to 4.15% in 2013, compared to 3.68% in 2012. The 30+ day delinquency rate decreased to 3.54% as of December 31, 2013, compared to 3.69% as of December 31, 2012. The increase in net charge-off rates in 2013 were largely due to the impact of charge-offs from the 2012 U.S. card acquisition which was recorded at fair value. Domestic Card Business Domestic Card generated net income from continuing operations of $2.2 billion , $2.4 billion and $1.4 billion in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. Domestic Card accounted for 90% of total net revenues for our Credit Card business in 2014 , compared to 90% and 89% in 2013 and 2012 , respectively, for our Credit Card business. Income attributable to Domestic Card represented 90% of net income for our Credit Card business in 2014 , compared to 91% and 92% in 2013 and 2012 , respectively.

Because our Domestic Card business accounts for the substantial majority of our Credit Card business, the key factors driving the results discussed above are similar to the key factors affecting our total Credit Card business. The primary driver of the decline in net income for our Domestic Card business in 2014 , compared to 2013 , was a decrease in revenue primarily driven by the Portfolio Sale and higher marketing expenses, partially offset by lower acquisition-related costs and provision for litigation matters, as well as lower operating expenses attributable to the Portfolio Sale in 2013 and operating efficiencies. The primary drivers of the improvement in results for our Domestic Card business in 2013, compared to 2012, included: (i) higher interest income primarily driven by a higher average yield on loans held for investment driven largely by the transfer of the Best Buy loan portfolio to the held for sale category in the first quarter of 2013, as well as the absence of the charge recorded in the second quarter of 2012 to establish the finance charge and fee reserve for the acquired credit card loans; (ii) the increase in interest and non-interest income in 2013 due to the full year impact of 2012 U.S. card acquisition; and (iii) the absence of the provision for credit losses of $1.2 billion recorded in the second quarter of 2012 to establish an allowance for acquired credit card loans. These impacts were partially offset by higher operating expenses attributable to the addition of loans and increased amortization of intangibles and other assets associated with the 2012 U.S. card acquisition. International Card Business International Card generated net income from continuing operations of $240 million , $234 million and $126 million in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. International Card accounted for 10% of total net revenues in 2014 , compared to 10% and 11% in 2013 and 2012 , respectively, for our Credit Card business. Income attributable to International Card represented 10% of net income for our Credit Card business in 2014 , compared to 9% and 8% of net income for 2013 and 2012 , respectively. 56 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 6.2 summarizes the financial results for International Card and displays selected key metrics for the periods indicated.

Our International Card business generated net income from continuing operations of $240 million in 2014 , compared to net income from continuing operations of $234 million in 2013 . The increase was primarily due to a lower provision for credit losses, attributable to lower net charge-offs resulting from credit improvement, partially offset by lower non-interest income due to a decrease in service charges and other customer-related fees. Our International Card business generated net income from continuing operations of $234 million in 2013 , compared to net income from continuing operations of $126 million in 2012 . The primary drivers of the improvement in results for our International Card business in 2013, compared to 2012, included: (i) the absence of charges recorded in the second quarter of 2012 associated with refunds to U.K. customers due to retrospective regulatory requirements pertaining to Payment Protection Insurance, which had an unfavorable impact on total net revenue and non-interest expense in 2012; and (ii) a reduction in the provision for credit losses attributable to lower net charge-offs, reflecting the improvement in the credit environment in Canada and the U.K. 57 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Consumer Banking Business The primary sources of revenue for our Consumer Banking business are net interest income from loans and deposits and non-interest income from service charges and customer-related fees. Expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, ongoing operating costs, such as salaries and associate benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, professional services, communications and data processing expenses, as well as marketing expenses.

(3) Includes Acquired Loans in our consumer banking loan portfolio with carrying values of $23.3 billion and $28.2 billion as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. (4) Calculation of ratio adjusted to exclude the impact from Acquired Loans. See Credit Risk Profile and Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional information on the impact of Acquired Loans on our credit quality metrics. (5) Calculated by dividing nonperforming assets as of the end of the period by the sum of period-end loans held for investment, foreclosed properties, and other foreclosed assets. (6) Calculated by dividing the allowance for loan and lease losses as of the end of the period by period-end loans held for investment. Key factors affecting the results of our Consumer Banking business for 2014 , compared to 2013 , and changes in financial condition and credit performance between December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 include the following: Net Interest Income: Net interest income decreased by $157 million or 3% , to $5.7 billion in 2014 , compared to $5.9 billion in 2013 . The decrease in net interest income was primarily attributable to compression in deposit spreads in retail banking, declining home loan portfolio balances, and margin compression in our auto loan portfolio. The decreases were partially offset by higher net interest income generated by growth in our auto loan portfolio. Consumer Banking yields increased to 6.3% in 2014 , as compared to 6.1% in 2013 . The increase in 2014 from 2013 was driven by changes in the product mix in Consumer Banking as a result of growth in our auto loan portfolio and the run-off of the acquired home loan portfolio. The increase in our auto loans in relation to our total consumer banking loan portfolio drove an increase in the total Consumer Banking yield, even as the average yield on auto loans decreased to 8.7% in 2014 as compared to 9.8% in 2013 . This decrease was primarily attributable to a shift to a higher portion of prime auto loans and increased competition in the auto business. The average yield on home loans was 3.8% and 3.4% in 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The higher yield in the home loan portfolio was driven by an increase in expected cash flows as a result of credit improvement on the acquired home loan portfolio. Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income decreased by $65 million , or 9% , to $684 million in 2014 , compared to $749 million in 2013 . The decrease in non-interest income in 2014 was primarily attributable to the sale of certain MSRs in 2013 . Provision for Credit Losses: The provision for credit losses increased by $47 million , or 7% , to $703 million in 2014 , compared to $656 million in 2013 . The increase in 2014 , as compared to 2013 , was driven by higher net charge-offs due 59 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents to the growth in our auto loan portfolio and a smaller release of the allowance for loan and lease losses in the retail banking and home loan portfolios, offset by a smaller allowance build in the auto loan portfolio. Non-Interest Expense : Non-interest expense increased by $124 million , or 3% , to $3.9 billion in 2014 , compared to $3.7 billion in 2013 . The increase was largely due to the growth in our auto loan portfolio and to a smaller degree, the change to include the auto repossession-related expenses as a component of operating expenses. Prior to January 1, 2014, these costs were reported as a component of net charge-offs. Loans Held for Investment : Period-end loans held for investment increased by $677 million , or 1% , to $71.4 billion as of December 31, 2014 , from $70.8 billion as of December 31, 2013 , primarily due to the growth in the auto loan portfolio, mostly offset by the run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio. Average loans held for investment decreased by $1.5 billion, or 2%, to $71.0 billion in 2014 , compared to $72.5 billion in 2013 due to the run-off in our acquired home loan portfolio outpacing growth in our auto loan portfolio. Deposits : Period-end deposits increased by $426 million , or less than 1%, to $168.1 billion as of December 31, 2014 , from $167.7 billion as of December 31, 2013 . Net Charge-off and Delinquency Statistics : The net charge-off rate increased 10 basis points to 0.95% in 2014 , compared to 0.85% in 2013 . The increase in the net charge-off rate reflected a shift in the mix of the portfolio toward auto loans (which typically carry higher net charge-off rates than our home loan portfolio), as the home loan portfolio runs off. The 30+ day delinquency rate increased to 4.23% as of December 31, 2014 , from 3.89% as of December 31, 2013 . Key factors affecting the results of our Consumer Banking business for 2013, compared to 2012, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 include the following: Net Interest Income: Net interest income increased by $117 million, or 2%, to $5.9 billion in 2013, compared to $5.8 billion in 2012. The increase in net interest income is primarily attributable to growth in our auto loans portfolio, partially offset by lower auto and deposits margins. While average loan balances grew in 2013 as compared to 2012, we saw a decline in gross interest income due to overall lower average yields on loans. The decrease in auto yields was primarily attributable to a shift in the credit quality mix of our portfolio, as well as increased competition in the marketplace. The average yield on auto loans was 9.8% in 2013, as compared to 11.0% in 2012. The decrease in home loans was largely driven by the run-off of the acquired home loans portfolio. The average yield on home loans was 3.4% in 2013 compared to 3.6% in 2012. Average deposit balances increased to $169.7 billion in 2013, from $162.6 billion in 2012, while the average deposit interest rate declined to 0.63% in 2013, from 0.70% in 2012. Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income decreased by $33 million, or 4%, to $749 million in 2013, compared to $782 million in 2012, related to the mark-to-market gains on retained interests in interest-only strips and negative amortization mortgage securities recognized in the third quarter of 2012. Provision for Credit Losses : The provision for credit losses increased by $67 million, or 11%, to $656 million in 2013, reflecting higher auto loan charge-offs attributable to auto portfolio growth and an increase in the auto charge-off rate from historically low levels. Non-Interest Expense : Non-interest expense decreased by $126 million, or 3%, to $3.7 billion in 2013. The decrease was largely due to the absence of ING Direct acquisition-related costs and other one-time items incurred in 2012, which were partially offset by increased expenses related to the growth in our auto loan portfolio. Loans Held for Investment: Period-end loans held for investment in our Consumer Banking business declined by $4.4 billion, or 6%, to $70.8 billion as of December 31, 2013, due to the run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio, partially offset by higher period-end auto loan balances due to the continued high volume of auto loan originations. Average loans held for investment increased by $631 million, or 1%, to $72.5 billion in 2013 , compared to $71.8 billion in 2012 due to growth in our auto loan portfolio outpacing the run-off in our acquired home loan portfolio. Deposits: Period-end deposits in our Consumer Banking business declined by $4.7 billion, or 3%, to $167.7 billion as of December 31, 2013, primarily due to the expected run-off of our legacy National Direct Bank deposits. 60 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Net Charge-off and Delinquency Statistics : The net charge-off rate increased to 0.85% in 2013, compared to 0.74% in 2012. The 30+ day delinquency rate increased to 3.89% as of December 31, 2013, from 3.34% as of December 31, 2012. The increase in the net charge-off rates reflect moderately higher auto loan charge-offs, partially offset by improved home loan performance. The overall delinquency rates increased moderately largely due to the run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio, which were included in the denominator in calculating the delinquency rates. Commercial Banking Business The primary sources of revenue for our Commercial Banking business are net interest income from loans and deposits and non-interest income from customer fees and related transactions. Because we have some investments that generate tax-exempt income or tax credits, we make certain reclassifications to our Commercial Banking business results to present revenues on a taxable-equivalent basis. Expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, ongoing operating costs, such as salaries and associate benefits, occupancy, equipment, professional services, communications and data processing expenses, as well as marketing expenses. As of January 1, 2014, we adopted the proportional amortization method of accounting for Investments in Qualified Affordable Housing Projects. The proportional amortization method amortizes the cost of the investment over the period in which we will receive tax credits and other tax benefits, and the resulting amortization is recognized as a component of income taxes attributable to continuing operations. Historically, these investments were accounted for under the equity method of accounting and the passive losses related to the investments were recognized within non-interest expense. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for more information. Our Commercial Banking business generated net income from continuing operations of $659 million , $731 million and $810 million in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. 61 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 8 summarizes the financial results of our Commercial Banking business and displays selected key metrics for the periods indicated.

(7) Represents our portfolio of loans serviced for third parties related to the Beech Street business. Key factors affecting the results of our Commercial Banking business for 2014 , compared to 2013 , and changes in financial condition and credit performance between December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 include the following: Net Interest Income: Net interest income increased by $77 million , or 5% , to $1.8 billion in 2014 , compared to $1.7 billion in 2013 . The increase was driven by growth in commercial and multifamily real estate and commercial and industrial loans, partially offset by lower loan yields driven by market and competitive pressures. Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income increased by $55 million , or 14% , to $450 million in 2014 , compared to $395 million in 2013 , primarily driven by increased revenue related to fee-based services and products attributable to the Beech Street business. Provision for Credit Losses: The provision for credit losses increased by $117 million , to $93 million in 2014 , compared to a benefit of $24 million in 2013 , primarily due to the change from an allowance release in 2013 driven by credit improvements, to an allowance build in 2014 attributable to loan growth and portfolio specific risks. The above impact was partially offset by a smaller reserve build due to lower growth in unfunded lending commitments. Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense increased by $125 million , or 13% , to $1.1 billion in 2014 , compared to $958 million in 2013 , driven by operating expenses associated with continued investments in business growth. Loans Held for Investment: Period-end loans held for investment increased by $5.9 billion , or 13% , to $50.9 billion as of December 31, 2014 , from $45.0 billion as of December 31, 2013 , and average loans held for investment increased by $7.1 billion, or 17%, to $47.9 billion in 2014 , compared to $40.8 billion in 2013 . The increases were driven by loan growth in the commercial and industrial and commercial and multifamily real estate businesses. Deposits: Period-end deposits increased by $1.4 billion , or 5% , to $32.0 billion as of December 31, 2014 , from $30.6 billion as of December 31, 2013 , driven by our strategy to deepen and expand relationships with commercial customers. Net Charge-off Statistics: The net charge-off rate decreased to 0.02% in 2014 , from 0.03% in 2013 . The nonperforming loans rate increased to 0.34% as of December 31, 2014 , from 0.33% as of December 31, 2013 . The continued strength in the credit metrics in our Commercial Banking business reflects stable credit trends. Key factors affecting the results of our Commercial Banking business for 2013, compared to 2012, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 include the following: Net Interest Income: Net interest income increased by $123 million, or 8%, to $1.7 billion in 2013. The increase was primarily driven by growth in our commercial lending business and higher deposit balances. Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income increased by $55 million, or 16%, to $395 million in 2013, driven by increased revenue related to fee-based products and services from the Beech Street Capital acquisition. Provision for Credit Losses: The benefit for credit losses decreased by $246 million, or 91% , to $24 million in 2013, compared to $270 million in 2012 due to the stabilization of the credit outlook which resulted in a lower release of the allowance for loan and lease losses in 2013. Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense increased by $48 million, or 5%, to $958 million in 2013, driven by investments in business growth and infrastructure enhancements and the costs associated with Beech Street Capital. Loans Held for Investment: Period-end loans held for investment in our Commercial Banking business increased by $6.2 billion, or 16%, in 2013, to $45.0 billion as of December 31, 2013, and average loans held for investment increased by $4.9 63 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents billion, or 14%, to $40.8 billion in 2013 , compared to $35.9 billion in 2012. The increases were driven by strong loan originations in the commercial lending business, which was partially offset by the continued run-off of the small-ticket commercial real estate loan portfolio. Deposits: Period-end deposits in the Commercial Banking business increased by $701 million, or 2%, to $30.6 billion as of December 31, 2013, from $29.9 billion as of December 31, 2012, driven by our strategy to strengthen existing relationships and increase liquidity from commercial customers. Net Charge-off Statistics: The net charge-off rate decreased to 0.03% in 2013, from 0.12% in 2012. The nonperforming loan rate decreased to 0.33% as of December 31, 2013, from 0.73% as of December 31, 2012. The continued strength in the credit metrics in our Commercial Banking business reflected stable credit trends and underlying collateral values. Other Category Other includes unallocated amounts related to our centralized Corporate Treasury group activities, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability management, gains and losses on our investment securities portfolio and certain trading activities. Other also includes foreign exchange-rate fluctuations on foreign currency-denominated transactions; certain gains and losses on the sale and securitization of loans; unallocated corporate expenses that do not directly support the operations of the business segments or for which the business segments are not considered financially accountable in evaluating their performance, such as certain acquisition and restructuring charges; a portion of the net provision for representation and warranty losses related to continuing operations; certain material items that are non-recurring in nature; and offsets related to certain line-item reclassifications.

Net income from continuing operations recorded in Other was $90 million in 2014 , compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $443 million in 2013 . The shift to a net profit from a net loss was primarily due to lower funding costs, as well as the absence of the one-time charge associated with our redemption of trust preferred securities in January 2013. The shift in the Other category to a net loss from continuing operations of $443 million in 2013, from net income from continuing operations of $6 million in 2012, was primarily due to three non-recurring items recognized in 2012 related to the ING Direct acquisition. We recognized a bargain purchase gain of $594 million related to the ING Direct acquisition and a gain of $162 million from the sale of Visa stock shares during the first quarter of 2012, which was partially offset by a derivative loss of $78 million recognized in the first quarter of 2012 related to the interest rate swaps we entered into in 2011 to partially hedge the interest rate risk of the net assets associated with the ING Direct acquisition. 64 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS ANALYSIS Total assets increased by $12.0 billion to $308.9 billion as of December 31, 2014 , from $296.9 billion , as of December 31, 2013 . The predominant area of asset growth was in loans held for investment, which increased $11.1 billion . Total liabilities increased by $8.5 billion to $263.8 billion as of December 31, 2014 , from $255.3 billion as of December 31, 2013 , primarily driven by issuances of long-term debt. Stockholders equity increased by $3.5 billion to $45.1 billion as of December 31, 2014 , from $41.6 billion as of December 31, 2013 . The increase in stockholders equity was primarily attributable to our net income of $4.4 billion in 2014 and $969 million in preferred stock issuances during 2014 , partially offset by $2.0 billion of share repurchases under the 2014 Stock Repurchase Program and dividend payments of $747 million . The following is a discussion of material changes in the major components of our assets and liabilities during 2014 . Period-end balance sheet amounts may vary from average balance sheet amounts due to liquidity and balance sheet management activities that are intended to ensure the adequacy of capital while managing our liquidity requirements for the Company and our customers and our market risk exposure in accordance with our risk appetite. Investment Securities Our investment portfolio consists primarily of the following: U.S. Treasury and agency debt; corporate debt securities guaranteed by U.S. government agencies; U.S. government-sponsored enterprise or agency ( Agency ) and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities ( RMBS ) and commercial mortgage-backed securities ( CMBS ); other asset-backed securities ( ABS ); and other investments. The carrying value of our investments in U.S. Treasury, Agency securities and other securities guaranteed by the U.S. government or agencies of the U.S. government represented 86% and 77% of our total investment securities portfolio as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The increase in our investment in U.S. Treasury and Agency securities is primarily due to our preparation for the final rules implementing the Basel III liquidity coverage ratio, for which we provide additional information in Part I Item 1. Business Supervision and Regulation . During 2014 , the fair value of our investment portfolio increased by $2.1 billion , or 4% , to $63.1 billion as of December 31, 2014 from $61.0 billion as of December 31, 2013 . This increase was primarily driven by lower market interest rates. During 2013, the fair value of our investment portfolio decreased by $3.0 billion, or 5%, to $61.0 billion as of December 31, 2013 from $64.0 billion as of December 31, 2012. The fair value of our securities available for sale portfolio was $41.8 billion as of December 31, 2013, a $22.2 billion decrease from $64.0 billion as of December 31, 2012. This decrease was primarily driven by the transfer of securities available for sale to securities held to maturity with a fair value of $18.3 billion as of the date of the transfer. We transferred these securities to held to maturity in consideration of changes to regulatory capital requirements under the final Basel III capital standards, and to reduce the impact of price volatility on AOCI. The transferred securities included net pre-tax unrealized losses of $1.5 billion at the date of transfer. Excluding the change on the held to maturity securities subsequent to the transfer, the fair value of our securities decreased $4 billion in 2013 driven by the rise in interest rates and normal portfolio activity. We had gross unrealized gains of $886 million and gross unrealized losses of $237 million on available-for sale investment securities as of December 31, 2014 , compared to gross unrealized gains of $799 million and gross unrealized losses of $631 million as of December 31, 2013 . The decrease in gross unrealized losses in 2014 was primarily driven by lower interest rates. Of the $237 million in gross unrealized losses as of December 31, 2014 , $206 million was related to securities that had been in a loss position for more than 12 months. We provide information on OTTI recognized in earnings on our investment securities above in Consolidated Results of Operations Non-Interest Income. 65 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 10 presents the amortized cost, carrying value and fair value for the major categories of our portfolio of investment securities as of December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 .

Credit Ratings Our portfolio of investment securities continues to be concentrated in securities that generally have high credit ratings and low credit risk, such as securities issued and guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury and Agencies. Approximately 93% and 92% of our total investment securities portfolio was rated AA+ or its equivalent, or better, as of December 31, 2014 , and 2013 , respectively, while approximately 6% and 5% was below investment grade as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. We categorize the credit ratings of our investment securities based on the lowest credit rating as issued by the following rating agencies: Standard & Poor Ratings Services ( S&P ), Moody Investors Service ( Moody ) and Fitch Ratings ( Fitch ).

The increase was primarily due to commercial and industrial, and commercial and multifamily real estate loan growth in our Commercial Banking business, strong growth in our domestic card loan portfolio in our Credit Card business, and strong auto loan originations outpacing the run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio in our Consumer Banking business. We provide additional information on the composition of our loan portfolio and credit quality below in Credit Risk Profile , MD&A Consolidated Results of Operations and Note 4 Loans . Loans Held for Sale Loans held for sale, which are carried at lower of cost or fair value, increased to $626 million as of December 31, 2014 , from $218 million as of December 31, 2013 . The increase was primarily driven by higher originations in the Commercial Banking business and timing of sales of loans. Deposits Our deposits represent our largest source of funding for our operations, providing a consistent source of low-cost funds. Total deposits increased by $1.0 billion to $205.5 billion as of December 31, 2014 , from $204.5 billion as of December 31, 2013 . The increase in deposits was primarily driven by the growth in our Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking businesses as a result of our continued focus on deepening deposit relationships with existing customers and our continued marketing strategy to attract new business. We provide information on the composition of our deposits, average outstanding balances, interest expense and yield below in Liquidity Risk Profile . 67 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Securitized Debt Obligations Securitized debt obligations increased by $1.3 billion during 2014 , to $11.6 billion as of December 31, 2014 , from $10.3 billion as of December 31, 2013 . The increase was driven by issuances of $4.3 billion of securitized debt obligations during 2014 , partially offset by maturities of $3.0 billion . We provide additional information on our borrowings below in Liquidity Risk Profile . Other Debt Other debt, which consists primarily of federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, senior and subordinated notes and FHLB advances, totaled $36.8 billion as of December 31, 2014 , of which $17.1 billion represented short-term borrowings and $19.7 billion represented long-term debt. Other debt totaled $30.4 billion as of December 31, 2013 , of which $16.2 billion represented short-term borrowings and $14.2 billion represented long-term debt. The increase in other debt of $6.4 billion in 2014 was primarily attributable to the issuance of $7.8 billion of unsecured senior notes, as well as net increases of $1.0 billion in FHLB advances, partially offset by maturities of $2.4 billion in unsecured senior notes. We provide additional information on our borrowings below in Liquidity Risk Profile and in Note 9 Deposits and Borrowings . Mortgage Representation and Warranty Reserve We acquired three subsidiaries that originated residential mortgage loans and sold these loans to various purchasers, including purchasers who created securitization trusts. These subsidiaries are Capital One Home Loans, LLC, which was acquired in February 2005; GreenPoint, which was acquired in December 2006 as part of the North Fork Bancorporation, Inc. ( North Fork ) acquisition; and CCB, which was acquired in February 2009 and subsequently merged into CONA. We have established representation and warranty reserves for losses associated with the mortgage loans sold by each subsidiary that we consider to be both probable and reasonably estimable, including both litigation and non-litigation liabilities. These reserves are reported on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other liabilities. The reserve setting process relies heavily on estimates, which are inherently uncertain, and requires the application of judgment. We evaluate these estimates on a quarterly basis. We build our representation and warranty reserves through the provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses, which we report in our consolidated statements of income as a component of non-interest income for loans originated and sold by CCB and Capital One Home Loans, LLC and as a component of discontinued operations for loans originated and sold by GreenPoint. The aggregate reserve for all three entities totaled $731 million as of December 31, 2014 , compared to $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2013 . The table below summarizes changes in our representation and warranty reserve in 2014 and 2013 . Table 13 : Changes in Representation and Warranty Reserve (1) Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2014 2013 Representation and warranty reserve, beginning of period $ 1,172 $ 899 (Benefit) provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses: Recorded in continuing operations (26 ) (24 ) Recorded in discontinued operations (7 ) 333 Total (benefit) provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses (33 ) 309 Net realized losses (408 ) (36 ) Representation and warranty reserve, end of period $ 731 $ 1,172 __________ (1) Reported on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other liabilities. As part of our business planning processes, we have considered various outcomes relating to the future representation and warranty liabilities of our subsidiaries that are possible but do not rise to the level of being both probable and reasonably estimable outcomes justifying an incremental accrual under applicable accounting standards. Our current best estimate of reasonably possible future losses from representation and warranty claims beyond what was in our reserve as of December 31, 2014 , is approximately $2.1 billion , a decline from our estimate of $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2013 . The decrease in the reasonably possible estimate of the representation and warranty reserve was primarily driven by claims paid and legal developments including settlements. 68 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents We provide additional information related to the representation and warranty reserve, including factors that may impact the adequacy of the reserve and the ultimate amount of losses incurred by our subsidiaries, in Note 20 Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others . Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent decreases or increases in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of future reversals of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management judgment that realization is more likely than not. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of expected taxable income from all sources, including taxable income in carryback years, reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates. We use our historical experience and our short and long-range business forecasts to provide insight. As of December 31, 2014 , we have recorded deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities and valuation allowances, of approximately $3.3 billion, which is a decrease of $400 million from $3.7 billion at December 31, 2013 . We have recorded a valuation allowance of $148 million and $139 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. We expect to fully realize the 2014 net deferred tax asset amounts in future periods. If changes in circumstances lead us to change our judgment about our ability to realize deferred tax assets in future years, we will adjust our valuation allowances in the period that our change in judgment occurs and record a corresponding increase or charge to income. We provide additional information on income taxes in Consolidated Results of Operations and in Note 17 Income Taxes . OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various types of arrangements with limited liability companies, partnerships or trusts that often involve special purpose entities and variable interest entities ( VIE ). Some of these arrangements are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or may be recorded in amounts different from the full contract or notional amount of the arrangements, depending on the nature or structure of, and accounting required to be applied to, the arrangement. These arrangements may expose us to potential losses in excess of the amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. Our involvement in these arrangements can take many forms, including securitization and servicing activities, the purchase or sale of mortgage-backed or other asset-backed securities in connection with our home loan portfolio and loans to VIEs that hold debt, equity, real estate or other assets. Our continuing involvement in unconsolidated VIEs primarily consists of certain mortgage loan trusts and community reinvestment and development entities. We provide a discussion of our activities related to these VIEs in Note 6 Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations . CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The level and composition of our capital are determined by multiple factors, including our consolidated regulatory capital requirements and internal risk-based capital assessments such as internal stress testing and economic capital. The level and composition of our capital may also be influenced by rating agency guidelines, subsidiary capital requirements, the business environment, conditions in the financial markets and assessments of potential future losses due to adverse changes in our business and market environments. Capital Standards and Prompt Corrective Action Bank holding companies and national banks are subject to capital adequacy standards adopted by the Federal Reserve and the OCC, respectively. The capital adequacy standards set forth minimum risk-based and leverage capital requirements that are based on quantitative and qualitative measures of assets and off-balance sheet items. National banks, as insured depository institutions, are also subject to Prompt Corrective Action ( PCA ) capital regulations, which require the U.S. federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action for banks that do not meet established minimum capital requirements. 69 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents In July 2013, the Federal Banking Agencies finalized a new capital rule that implements the Basel III capital accord (the Final Basel III Capital Rules ) developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ( Basel Committee ) and certain Dodd-Frank Act capital provisions and updates the PCA capital requirements. Prior to being revised in the Final Basel III Capital Rules, the minimum risk-based capital requirements adopted by the U.S. federal banking agencies followed the Basel I framework, originally promulgated pursuant to the Basel Committee Basel I accord, and the advanced approaches capital rules ( Advanced Approaches ), based upon the framework originally promulgated as a result of the Basel II accord. The Final Basel III Capital Rules amended both the Basel I and Advanced Approaches frameworks, establishing a new common equity Tier 1 capital requirement and setting higher minimum capital ratio requirements. The Company refers to the amended Basel I framework as the Basel III Standardized Approach, and the amended Advanced Approaches framework as the Basel III Advanced Approaches. At the end of 2012, the Company met one of the two independent eligibility criteria set by banking regulators for becoming subject to the Advanced Approaches capital rules. As a result, the Company has undertaken a multi-year process of implementing the Advanced Approaches regime for calculating risk-weighted assets and regulatory capital levels. Certain provisions of the Final Basel III Capital Rules began to take effect on January 1, 2014 for Advanced Approaches banking organizations, including the Company. The Company entered parallel run under Advanced Approaches on January 1, 2015, during which it will calculate capital ratios under both the Basel III Standardized Approach and the Basel III Advanced Approaches, though it will continue to use the Basel III Standardized Approach for purposes of meeting regulatory capital requirements. By rule, the parallel run must last at least four consecutive quarters. Therefore, the first quarter of 2016 is the earliest possible date on which the Company would use the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework in calculating its regulatory capital and risk-weighted assets for purposes of risk-based capital requirements. Consistent with the experience of other U.S. banks, it is possible that our parallel run will last longer than the four quarter minimum. Under the Dodd-Frank Act and the Final Basel III Capital Rules, organizations subject to Basel III Advanced Approaches may not hold less capital than would be required under the Basel III Standardized Approach. Therefore, even after we exit parallel run, we will continue to calculate regulatory capital and risk-weighted assets under the Basel III Standardized Approach. As of January 1, 2014, the new minimum risk-based and leverage capital requirements for Advanced Approaches banking organizations include a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 4.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 5.5%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0%, and a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 4.0%. On January 1, 2015, the minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements increased to 4.5% for the common equity Tier 1 capital ratio and to 6.0% for the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio. The minimum requirements for the total risk-based capital ratio and the Tier 1 leverage capital ratio did not change from 2014 to 2015. The Final Basel III Capital Rules also introduced a new supplementary leverage ratio of 3.0% for all Advanced Approaches banking organizations. On September 3, 2014 the Federal Banking Agencies issued a final rule that revised the calculation of total leverage exposures and implemented the supplementary leverage ratio. The supplementary leverage ratio compares Tier 1 capital to total leverage exposures, and includes all on-balance sheet assets and many off-balance sheet assets, including derivatives and unused commitments. The new supplementary leverage ratio becomes effective on January 1, 2018, however as an Advanced Approaches banking organization, we are required to calculate and publicly disclose our supplementary leverage ratio beginning in the first quarter of 2015. Insured depository institutions are also subject to PCA capital regulations. Under current PCA regulations, an insured depository institution is considered to be well-capitalized if it maintains a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.0%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0%, a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 5.0%, and is not subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or PCA directive issued by its regulator. While the Final Basel III Capital Rules increased some of the thresholds for the PCA capital categories and add the new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio to the PCA regulations, those changes are not effective until January 1, 2015. Beginning on January 1, 2015, the well-capitalized level for the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio will increase to 8.0%, and the well-capitalized level for the common equity Tier 1 capital ratio will be established at 6.5%. The well-capitalized levels for the total risk-based capital ratio and the Tier 1 leverage capital ratio will not change. Prior to 2014, we also disclosed a Tier 1 common capital ratio for our bank holding company, which is a regulatory capital measure widely used by investors, analysts, rating agencies and bank regulatory agencies to assess the capital position of financial services companies. There was no mandated minimum or well-capitalized standard for the Tier 1 common capital ratio. We disclose a non-GAAP TCE ratio in Part II Item 6. Summary of Selected Financial Data . While the TCE ratio is a capital measure widely used by investors, analysts, rating agencies, and bank regulatory agencies to assess the capital position of financial services companies, it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We provide information 70 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents on the calculation of this ratio in MD&A Table F Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures and Calculation of Regulatory Capital Measures. Table 14 provides a comparison of our regulatory capital ratios under the Federal Banking Agencies capital adequacy standards as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 . Under the Final Basel III Capital Rules, beginning on January 1, 2014, as an Advanced Approaches banking organization that had yet to enter or exit parallel run, we began using the Basel III Standardized Approach for calculating our regulatory capital, subject to applicable transition provisions. Throughout 2014, we continued to use Basel I for calculating our risk-weighted assets in our regulatory capital ratios, as required under the Final Basel III Capital Rules. On January 1, 2015, we began using the Basel III Standardized Approach for calculating our risk-weighted assets in our regulatory capital ratios.

See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional information. Prior periods have been recast to conform to this presentation. (2) Capital ratios are calculated based on the Basel III Standardized Approach framework, subject to applicable transition provisions, as of December 31, 2014 and are calculated based on the Basel I capital framework as of December 31, 2013. Capital ratios that are not applicable are denoted by N/A. See MD&A Table F Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures and Calculation of Regulatory Capital Measures for additional information. (3) Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio is a regulatory capital measure under Basel III calculated based on common equity Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets. (4) Tier 1 common capital ratio is calculated based on Tier 1 common capital divided by Basel I risk-weighted assets. (5) Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets. (6) Total risk-based capital ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on total risk-based capital divided by risk-weighted assets. (7) Tier 1 leverage ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by average assets, after certain adjustments. Capital One Financial Corporation exceeded Federal Banking Agencies minimum capital requirements and the Banks exceeded minimum regulatory requirements and were well-capitalized under PCA requirements as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 . Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, as calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach, subject to transition provisions, was 12.46% as of December 31, 2014 . Our Tier 1 common capital ratio, as calculated under Basel I, was 12.19% as of December 31, 2013 . These numbers are not directly comparable due to methodological differences in the calculation of the ratios and the transition requirements under the Final Basel III Capital Rules. For purposes of our capital plan that was submitted to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve on January 5, 2015, we will be assessed on our ability to maintain specified minimum levels of capital under our currently effective Basel III Standardized Approach regime, along with a Tier 1 common ratio of 5.0% on a pro forma 71 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents basis as calculated under Basel I, under baseline and stressful conditions. We estimate that our Tier 1 common ratio, as calculated under Basel I, was approximately 12.46% as of December 31, 2014 . See MD&A Table F Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures and Calculation of Regulatory Capital Measures for additional information about our Tier 1 common ratio as calculated under Basel I. As described above, we currently are using the Basel III Standardized Approach for calculating our regulatory capital, subject to transition provisions. The calculation of our Basel III Standardized Approach common equity Tier 1 capital under the Final Basel III Capital Rules includes additional adjustments and deductions not included in the Tier 1 common capital calculation under Basel I, such as the inclusion of the unrealized gains and losses on available for sale investment securities included in AOCI and adjustments related to intangibles. The inclusion of AOCI and the adjustments related to intangibles are phased-in at 20% for 2014, 40% for 2015, 60% for 2016, 80% for 2017 and 100% for 2018. The following table compares our common equity Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets as of December 31, 2014 , calculated based on the Final Basel III Capital Rules, subject to applicable transition provisions, to our estimated common equity Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets as of December 31, 2014 , calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach, as it applies when fully phased-in. Our estimated common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under fully phased-in Basel III Standardized Approach is based on our interpretations, expectations and assumptions of relevant regulations, interpretations provided by our regulators, and is subject to change based on changes to future regulations and interpretations. In November 2014, our regulators informed us that they had updated their interpretation guidance regarding the prospective capital treatment for certain securitization exposures. This guidance resulted in a reduction of approximately 20 basis points to our estimated fully phased-in Basel III Standardized Approach common equity Tier 1 capital ratio. As we continue to engage with our regulators during our parallel run, we anticipate that there could be further changes to the calculation. See the table and notes below for further discussion on our interpretations, expectations and assumptions used in calculating this ratio. Table 15 : Estimated Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio under Fully Phased-In Basel III Standardized Approach (1) (Dollars in millions) December 31, 2014 Common equity Tier 1 capital under Basel III Standardized $ 29,534 Adjustments related to AOCI (2) (362 ) Adjustments related to intangibles (2) (973 ) Other adjustments (2) (1 ) Estimated common equity Tier 1 capital under fully phased-in Basel III Standardized $ 28,198 Risk-weighted assets under Basel I $ 236,944 Adjustments for Basel III Standardized (3) 9,075 Estimated risk-weighted assets under Basel III Standardized $ 246,019 Estimated common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under fully phased-in Basel III Standardized (4) 11.5 % __________ (1) Estimated common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under fully phased-in Basel III Standardized Approach is a non-GAAP financial measure. (2) Assumes adjustments are fully phased-in. (3) Adjustments to the Basel I approach to calculating risk-weighted assets include higher risk weights for exposures 90 days or more past due or in nonaccrual, high volatility commercial real estate, securitization exposures and corresponding adjustments to PCCR intangibles, deferred tax assets and certain other assets in the calculation of common equity Tier 1 capital under the Basel III Standardized Approach. (4) Calculated by dividing estimated common equity Tier 1 capital under the fully phased-in Basel III Standardized Approach by estimated risk-weighted assets under the Basel III Standardized Approach. Under the Final Basel III Capital Rules, when we complete our parallel run for the Advanced Approaches, our minimum risk-based capital requirement will be the greater requirement of the Basel III Standardized Approach and the Basel III Advanced Approaches. See Part 1 Item 1 Supervision and Regulation Basel III and U.S. Capital Rules for additional information. Based on our business mix, we anticipate that we will need to hold more regulatory capital under the Basel III Advanced Approaches than under the Basel III Standardized Approach to meet our minimum required regulatory capital ratios. 72 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Capital Planning and Regulatory Stress Testing In November 2011, the Federal Reserve finalized capital planning rules applicable to large bank holding companies like us. Under these rules, bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more must submit a capital plan to the Federal Reserve on an annual basis that contains a description of all planned capital actions, including dividends or stock repurchases, over a nine-quarter planning horizon beginning with the fourth quarter of the calendar year prior to the submission of the capital plan ( CCAR cycle ). The bank holding company may take the capital actions in its capital plan if the Federal Reserve provides a non-objection to the plan. For the 2014 CCAR cycle, the Federal Reserve objection or non-objection applies specifically to capital actions during the four quarters beginning with the second quarter of 2014 in the planning horizon ( approval window ). On October 17, 2014, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule to modify the regulations for capital planning and stress testing. The final rule changes the annual capital plan and stress test cycle start date from October 1 to January 1, effective for the cycle beginning January 1, 2016. To allow for a transition to the change in timing, the Federal Reserve objection or non-objection applies to the capital actions spanning the five quarters starting with the second quarter of 2015 for the 2015 CCAR cycle. Subsequent submissions each would cover a four-quarter period. For additional information on the Final Rule, see Part 1 Item 1. Business Supervision and Regulation. After the Federal Reserve non-objection to our 2014 capital plan, we maintained our quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share for all four quarters in 2014. In addition, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of shares of common stock through the end of the first quarter of 2015. During 2014, we repurchased approximately $2.0 billion of common stock and expect to complete the 2014 Stock Repurchase Program by the end of the first quarter of 2015. We expect to complete this repurchase program by the end of the first quarter of 2015. On January 5, 2015 we submitted our capital plan to the Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve as part of the 2015 CCAR cycle. Equity Offerings and Transactions On June 12, 2014, the Company issued and sold 20 million depositary shares ( Depositary Shares ), each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of 6.25% fixed-rate non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series C, $0.01 par value, with a liquidation preference of $25 per Depositary Share (equivalent to $1,000 per share of Series C Preferred Stock) (the Series C Preferred Stock ). The net proceeds of the offering of Series C Preferred Stock were approximately $484 million , after deducting underwriting commissions and offering expenses. On October 31, 2014, the Company issued and sold 20 million Depositary Shares, each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of 6.70% fixed-rate non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series D, $0.01 par value, with a liquidation preference of $25 per Depositary Share (equivalent to $1,000 per share of Series D Preferred Stock) (the Series D Preferred Stock ). The net proceeds of the offering of Series D Preferred Stock were approximately $485 million , after deducting underwriting commissions and offering expenses. Under the terms of the Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock, the ability of the Company to pay dividends on, make distributions with respect to, or to repurchase, redeem or acquire its common stock or any preferred stock ranking on parity with or junior to the preferred stock, is subject to restrictions in the event that the Company does not declare and either pay or set aside a sum sufficient for payment of dividends on the related series of preferred stock for the immediately preceding dividend period. Dividend Policy and Stock Purchases We paid common stock dividends of $0.30 per share in each quarter of 2014. We paid preferred stock dividends of $15.00 per share on the outstanding shares of our 6.00% fixed-rate non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series B (the Series B Preferred Stock ) in each quarter of 2014. We also paid preferred stock dividends of $13.7153 per share and $15.625 per share in the third and fourth quarters of 2014, respectively, on the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock. On January 29, 2015, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share, payable on February 20, 2015 and quarterly dividends on our Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, and Series D Preferred Stock payable on March 2, 2015. Based on these declarations, the Company will pay approximately $166 million in common equity dividends and approximately $32 million in total preferred dividends in the first quarter of 2015. The declaration and payment of dividends to our stockholders, as well as the amount thereof, are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, capital levels, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors. As a bank holding company, our ability to pay dividends is largely 73 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents dependent upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries. Regulatory restrictions exist that limit the ability of the Banks to transfer funds to our bank holding company. Funds available for dividend payments from COBNA and CONA were $1.6 billion and $281 million , respectively, as of December 31, 2014. There can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends to stockholders. The timing and exact amount of any future common stock repurchases will depend on various factors, including market conditions, our capital position and amount of retained earnings. Our stock repurchase program does not include specific price targets, may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including utilizing Rule 10b5-1 programs, and may be suspended at any time. For additional information on dividends and stock repurchases, see Part I Item 1. Business Supervision and Regulation Dividends, Stock Repurchases and Transfer of Funds. RISK MANAGEMENT Risk Framework We use a risk framework to provide an overall enterprise-wide approach for effectively managing risk. We execute against our risk framework with the Three Lines of Defense risk management model to demonstrate and structure the roles, responsibilities and accountabilities in the organization for taking and managing risk. The First Line of Defense is comprised of the business areas that through their day-to-day business activities take risk on our behalf. As the business owner, the first line is responsible for identifying, assessing, managing and controlling that risk, and for mitigating our overall risk exposure. The first line formulates strategy and operates within the risk appetite and framework. The Second Line of Defense provides oversight of first line risk taking and management, and is comprised primarily of our Risk Management organization. The second line assists in determining risk capacity, risk appetite, and the strategies, policies and structure for managing risks. The second line owns the risk framework. The second line is both an expert advisor to the first line and an effective challenger of first line risk activities. The Third Line of Defense is comprised of our Internal Audit and Credit Review functions. The third line provides independent and objective assurance to senior management and to the Board of Directors that first and second line risk management and internal control systems and its governance processes are well-designed and working as intended. Our risk framework, which is built around governance, processes and people, consists of the following eight key elements: Establish Governance Processes, Accountabilities and Risk Appetites The starting point of our risk framework is the establishment of governance processes, accountabilities and risk appetites. Our Board of Directors and senior management establish the tone at the top regarding the importance of internal control, including standards of conduct and the integrity and ethical values of the Company. Management reinforces the expectations at the various levels of the organization. This portion of the framework sets the foundation for the methods that govern risk taking, the interactions within and among the lines of defense and the risk appetites and tolerances. Identify and Assess Risks and Ownership Identifying and assessing risks and ownership is the beginning of the more detailed day-to-day process of managing risk. This portion of the framework clarifies the importance of strong first-line management and accountability for identifying and assessing risk while specifying the roles of the second line to identify and assess risk, particularly when taking on new initiatives. Develop and Operate Controls, Monitoring and Mitigation Plans We develop, operate and monitor controls to manage risk within tolerance levels. The first line develops controls to oversee and manage identified risks. Controls may prevent risks from occurring (e.g., ensuring compliance with a law or regulation), discover when a risk has been realized, or measure the amount of risk being taken so that the amount may be proactively managed. Whenever possible, plans are implemented to mitigate risks or reduce them to lower levels to reduce exposure. The first line leads mitigation, control and monitoring actions. The second line is a consultant on control design when needed. 74 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Test and Detect Control Gaps and Perform Corrective Action While the first line is principally accountable for taking, controlling and monitoring risk, the second line oversees and monitors first line risk taking, including the effectiveness of first line controls, and the third line independently tests first and second line controls. These activities provide the second and third lines of defense with the ability to reduce the likelihood of unauthorized or unplanned risk taking within the organization. Identified control gaps are closed by first line corrective action. Escalate Key Risks and Gaps to Executive Management and, when Appropriate, the Board of Directors Escalation is an important component of our overall risk framework. Use of escalation is encouraged and doesn t necessarily indicate a failure on the part of first, second or third line risk management. Through escalation in the first line, decisions requiring judgment can be raised to executives who have the broadest possible context and experience to make challenging choices. Escalation in the second and third lines of defense can also demonstrate part of their core responsibilities of effective challenge. Risks are escalated to the Board of Directors to ensure their alignment with material risk decisions and/or transparency to the largest risks facing the organization and to enable Board of Directors engagement when needed. Calculate and Allocate Capital in Alignment with Risk Management and Measurement Processes (including Stress Testing) Capital is held to protect the Company from unforeseen risks or unexpected risk severity. As such, it is important that capital planning processes be well linked with risk management practices to ensure the appropriate capital protections are in place for the safety and soundness of the Company. Stress testing and economic capital measurement, both of which incorporate inputs from across the risk spectrum, are key tools for evaluating our capital position and risk adjusted returns. Support with the Right Culture, Talent and Skills The right culture, talent and skills are critical to effective risk management. The activities and actions specified in our risk framework are supported with the right culture to ensure that both the spirit and the letter of the risk management action are pursued. Skills necessary to effectively manage risk are reinforced through performance management systems. When needed, risk talent is augmented through recruitment of industry experts as well as training and development of internal associates. Enable with the Right Data, Infrastructure and Programs Data, infrastructure and programs are key enablers of our overall risk management processes and practices. These core requirements enable effective risk modeling, efficient first, second and third line risk activity performance and cross-line interaction. In addition, effective program design of each risk category is regularly assessed to ensure risk practices continue to evolve with leading industry practice and continue to interact across categories as desired for a strong overall risk management program. Risk Appetite Risk appetite refers to the level of risk our business is willing to take in pursuit of our corporate business objectives. The Board of Directors approves our risk appetite including specific risk limits where applicable. While first line executives manage risk on a day-to-day basis, the Chief Risk Officer provides effective challenge and independent oversight to ensure that risks are within the appetite and specific limits established by the Board of Directors. The Chief Risk Officer reports to the Board of Directors regularly on the nature and level of risk across all eight risk categories. In addition to his broader management responsibilities, our Chief Executive Officer is responsible for developing the strategy and mission of our organization, determining and leading our culture, and reviewing and providing input into our risk appetite. We have a defined risk appetite for each of our eight risk categories that is approved by our Board of Directors. Stated risk appetites define the parameters for taking and accepting risks and are used by management and our Board of Directors to make business decisions. We communicate risk appetite statements, limits and thresholds to the appropriate levels in the organization and monitor adherence. Risk Categories We apply our Risk Framework to protect our company from the eight major categories of risk that we are exposed to through our business activities. Our eight major categories of risk are: 75 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Compliance Risk: Compliance risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from violations of laws, rules, or regulations. Compliance risk can also arise from nonconformance with prescribed practices, internal policies and procedures, contractual obligations, or ethical standards that reinforce those laws, rules, or regulations; Credit Risk: Credit risk is the risk of loss from an obligor failure to meet the terms of any contract or otherwise fail to perform as agreed; Legal Risk: Legal risk represents the risk of material adverse impact due to: new and changed laws and regulations; interpretations of law; drafting, interpretation and enforceability of contracts; adverse decisions or consequences arising from litigation or regulatory scrutiny; the establishment, management and governance of our legal entity structure; and the failure to seek or follow appropriate Legal counsel when needed; Liquidity Risk: Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its future financial obligations as they come due, or invest in future asset growth because of an inability to obtain funds at a reasonable price within a reasonable time period; Market Risk: Market risk is the risk that an institution earnings or the economic value of equity could be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or other market factors; Operational Risk: Operational risk is the risk of loss, capital impairment, adverse customer experience, or reputational impact resulting from failure to comply with policies and procedures, inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, or from external events; Reputation Risk: Reputation risk is the risk to market value, recruitment and retention of talented associates and maintenance of a loyal customer base due to the negative perceptions of Capital One internal and external constituents regarding Capital One business strategies and activities; and Strategic Risk: Strategic risk is the risk of material impact on current or anticipated earnings, capital, franchise or enterprise value arising from: the Company competitive and market position and evolving forces in the industry that can affect that position; lack of responsiveness to these conditions; strategic decisions to change the Company scale, market position or operating model; or failure to appropriately consider implementation risks inherent in the Company strategy. Below we provide an overview of how we manage our eight primary risk categories. Compliance Risk Management We recognize that compliance requirements for financial institutions are increasingly complex and that there are heightened expectations from our regulators and our customers. In response, we continuously evaluate the regulatory environment and pro-actively adjust our compliance risk program to fully address these expectations. Our Compliance Management Program establishes expectations for determining compliance requirements, assessing the risk of new product offerings, creating appropriate controls and training to address requirements, monitoring for control performance, and independently testing for adherence to compliance requirements. The program also establishes regular compliance reporting to senior business leaders, the executive committee and the Board of Directors. The Chief Compliance Officer is responsible for establishing and overseeing our Compliance Risk Management Program. Business areas incorporate compliance requirements and controls into their business policies, standards, processes and procedures. They regularly monitor and report on the efficacy of their compliance controls and Corporate Compliance periodically independently tests to validate the effectiveness of business controls. Credit Risk Management We recognize that we are exposed to cyclical changes in credit quality. Consequently, we try to ensure our credit portfolio is resilient to economic downturns. Our most important tool in this endeavor is sound underwriting. In unsecured consumer loan underwriting, we generally assume that loans will be subject to an environment in which losses are higher than those prevailing at the time of underwriting. In commercial underwriting, we generally require strong cash flow, collateral and covenants and guarantees. In addition to sound underwriting, we continually monitor our portfolio and take steps to collect or work out distressed loans. 76 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents The Chief Risk Officer, in conjunction with the Consumer and Commercial Chief Credit Officers, is responsible for establishing credit risk policies and procedures, including underwriting and hold guidelines and credit approval authority, and monitoring credit exposure and performance of our lending-related transactions. These responsibilities are fulfilled by the Chief Consumer Credit Officer and the Chief Commercial Credit Officer who are responsible for evaluating the risk implications of credit strategy and for oversight of credit for both the existing portfolio and any new credit investments. The Chief Consumer Credit Officer and the Chief Commercial Credit Officer have formal approval authority for various types and levels of credit decisions, including individual commercial loan transactions. Division Presidents within each segment are responsible for managing the credit risk within their divisions and maintaining processes to control credit risk and comply with credit policies and guidelines. In addition, the Chief Risk Officer establishes policies, delegates approval authority and monitors performance for non-loan credit exposure entered into with financial counterparties or through the purchase of credit sensitive securities in our investment portfolio. Our credit policies establish standards in five areas: customer selection, underwriting, monitoring, remediation, and portfolio management. The standards in each area provide a framework comprising specific objectives and control processes. These standards are supported by detailed policies and procedures for each component of the credit process. Starting with customer selection, our goal is to generally provide credit on terms that generate above hurdle returns. We use a number of quantitative and qualitative factors to manage credit risk, including setting credit risk limits and guidelines for each of our lines of business. We monitor performance relative to these guidelines and report results and any required mitigating actions to appropriate senior management committees and our Board of Directors. Legal Risk Management The General Counsel provides legal evaluation and guidance to the enterprise and business areas and partners with other risk management functions such as Compliance and Internal Audit. This evaluation and guidance is based on an assessment of the type and degree of legal risk associated with the internal business area practices and activities and of the controls the business has in place to mitigate legal risks. Liquidity Risk Management We seek to mitigate liquidity risk strategically and tactically. From a strategic perspective, we have acquired and built deposit gathering businesses and significantly reduced our loan to deposit ratio. From a tactical perspective, we have accumulated a sizable liquidity reserve comprised of cash, high-quality, unencumbered securities, and committed collateralized credit lines. We also continue to maintain access to the secured and unsecured markets through ongoing issuance. This combination of stable and diversified funding sources and our stockpile of liquidity reserves enables us to maintain confidence in our liquidity position. The Chief Risk Officer, in conjunction with the Chief Market and Liquidity Risk Officer, is responsible for the establishment of liquidity risk management policies and standards for governance and monitoring of liquidity risk at a corporate level. The Chief Financial Officer is accountable for the management of liquidity risk. We assess liquidity strength by evaluating several different balance sheet metrics under severe stress scenarios to ensure we can withstand significant funding degradation in both idiosyncratic, and market wide and combined liquidity stress scenarios. Management reports liquidity metrics to appropriate senior management committees and our Board of Directors no less than quarterly. We continuously monitor market and economic conditions to evaluate emerging stress conditions with assessment and appropriate action plans in accordance with our Contingency Funding Plan. Market Risk Management We recognize that interest rate and foreign exchange risk is inherent in the business of banking due to the nature of the assets and liabilities of banks. Banks typically manage the trade-off between near-term earnings volatility and market value volatility by targeting moderate levels of each. In addition to using industry accepted techniques to analyze and measure interest rate and foreign exchange risk, we perform sensitivity analysis to identify our risk exposures under a broad range of scenarios. Investment securities and derivatives are the main levers for the management of interest rate and foreign exchange risk. The Chief Risk Officer, in conjunction with the Chief Market and Liquidity Risk Officer, is responsible for the establishment of market risk management policies and standards and for governance and monitoring of market risk at a corporate level. The Chief Financial Officer is accountable for the management of market risk. We manage market risk exposure, which is principally driven by balance sheet interest rate risk, centrally and establish quantitative limits to control our exposure. Market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our business operations and activities, including loans, deposits, securities, short-term borrowings, long-term debt and derivatives. 77 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents The market risk positions of our banking entities and our total company are calculated separately and in total and are reported in comparison to pre-established limits to the Asset Liability Committee monthly and to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors no less than quarterly. Management is authorized to utilize financial instruments as outlined in our policy to actively manage market risk exposure. Operational Risk Management We recognize the criticality of managing operational risk on a day-to-day basis and that there are heightened expectations from our regulators and our customers. We have implemented appropriate operational risk management policies, standards, processes and tools to enable the delivery of high quality and consistent customer experiences. The Chief Operational Risk Officer is responsible for establishing and overseeing our Operational Risk Management Program. The program establishes and enforces requirements and practices for assessing the operational risk profile, executing key control processes for select operational risks, and reporting of operational risk results. These activities are executed in accordance with Basel II Advanced Approaches requirements. Reputation Risk Management We recognize that reputation risk is of particular concern for financial institutions as a result of the aftermath of the financial crisis and economic downturn, which has resulted in increased scrutiny and widespread regulatory changes. We manage both strategic and tactical reputation issues and build our relationships with the government, media, consumer advocates, and other constituencies to help strengthen the reputations of both our company and industry. Our actions include implementing pro-consumer practices in our business and taking public positions in support of better consumer practices in our industry. The General Counsel is responsible for managing our overall reputation risk program. Day-to-day activities are controlled by the frameworks set forth in our Reputation Risk Management Policy and other risk management policies. Strategic Risk Management Capital One monitors external market and industry developments to identify potential areas of strategic opportunity or risk. These items provide input for development of the Company strategy led by the Chief Executive Officer and other senior executives. Through the ongoing development and vetting of the corporate strategy, the Chief Risk Officer identifies and assesses risks associated with the strategy across all risk categories and monitors them throughout the year. CREDIT RISK PROFILE Our loan portfolio accounts for the substantial majority of our credit risk exposure. Our lending activities are governed under our credit policy and are subject to independent review and approval. Below we provide information about the composition of our loan portfolio, key concentrations and credit performance metrics. We also engage in certain non-lending activities that may give rise to credit and counterparty settlement risk, including the purchase of securities for our investment securities portfolio, entering into derivative transactions to manage our market risk exposure and to accommodate customers, foreign exchange transactions, and customer overdrafts. We provide additional information on credit risk related to our investment securities portfolio under Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis Investment Securities and credit risk related to derivative transactions in Note 10 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities . Primary Loan Products We provide a variety of lending products. Our primary loan products include credit cards, auto, home loans and commercial. Credit cards: We originate both prime and subprime credit cards through a variety of channels. Our credit cards generally have variable interest rates. Credit card accounts are underwritten using an automated underwriting system based on predictive models that we have developed. The underwriting criteria, which are customized for individual products and marketing programs, are established based on an analysis of the net present value of expected revenues, expenses and losses, subject to a further analysis using a variety of stress conditions. Underwriting decisions are generally based on credit bureau information, including payment history, debt burden and credit scores, such as FICO, and on other factors, such as applicant income. We maintain a credit card securitization program and selectively sell charged-off credit card loans. 78 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Auto: We originate both prime and subprime auto loans. Customers are acquired through a network of auto dealers and direct marketing. Our auto loans generally have fixed interest rates and loan terms of 72 months or less. Loan size limits are customized by program and are generally less than $75,000. Similar to credit card accounts, the underwriting criteria are customized for individual products and marketing programs and based on analysis of net present value of expected revenues, expenses and losses, subject to maintaining resilience under a variety of stress conditions. Underwriting decisions are generally based on an applicant income, estimated debt-to-income ratio, and credit bureau information, along with collateral characteristics such as loan-to-value ( LTV ) ratio. We generally retain all of our auto loans, though we have securitized and sold auto loans in the past and may do so in the future. Home loans: Most of the existing home loans in our loan portfolio were originated by banks we acquired. The underwriting standards for these loans were less restrictive than our current underwriting standards. Currently, we originate residential mortgage and home equity loans through our branches, direct marketing, and dedicated home loan officers. Our home loan products include conforming and non-conforming fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgage loans, as well as first and second lien home equity loans and lines of credit. In general, our underwriting policy limits for these loans include: (1) a maximum LTV ratio of 80% for loans without mortgage insurance; (2) a maximum LTV ratio of 95% for loans with mortgage insurance or for home equity products; (3) a maximum debt-to-income ratio of 50%; and (4) a maximum loan amount of $3 million. Our underwriting procedures are intended to verify the income of applicants and obtain appraisals to determine home values. We may, in limited instances, use automated valuation models to determine home values. Our underwriting standards for conforming loans are designed to meet the underwriting standards required by the agencies at a minimum, and we sell most of our conforming loans to the agencies. We generally retain non-conforming mortgages and home equity loans and lines of credit. Commercial: We offer a range of commercial lending products, including loans secured by commercial real estate and loans to middle market industrial and service companies. Our commercial loans may have a fixed or variable interest rate; however, the majority of our commercial loans have variable rates. Our underwriting standards require an analysis of the borrower financial condition and prospects, as well as an assessment of the industry in which the borrower operates. Where relevant, we evaluate and appraise underlying collateral and guarantees. We maintain underwriting guidelines and limits for major types of borrowers and loan products that specify, where applicable, guidelines for debt service coverage, leverage, LTV ratio and standard covenants and conditions. We assign a risk rating and establish a monitoring schedule for loans based on the risk profile of the borrower, industry segment, source of repayment, the underlying collateral and guarantees (if any) and current market conditions. Although we generally retain commercial loans, we may syndicate large positions for risk mitigation purposes. In addition, we originate and service multifamily commercial real estate loans which are sold to the government-sponsored enterprises. Loan Portfolio Composition Our loan portfolio consists of loans held for investment, including restricted loans underlying our consolidated securitization trusts and loans held for sale. Table 16 presents the composition of our portfolio of loans held for investment, including Acquired Loans, by portfolio segment, as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 . Table 16 and the credit metrics presented in this section exclude loans held for sale, which are carried at lower of cost or fair value and totaled $626 million and $218 million as of December 31, 2014 , and 2013 , respectively. 79 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 16 : Loan Portfolio Composition December 31, 2014 December 31, 2013 (Dollars in millions) Loans % of Total Loans % of Total Credit Card: Domestic credit card (1) $ 77,704 37.3 % $ 73,255 37.1 % International credit card 8,172 3.9 8,050 4.1 Total credit card 85,876 41.2 81,305 41.2 Consumer Banking: Auto 37,824 18.2 31,857 16.2 Home loan (2) 30,035 14.4 35,282 17.9 Retail banking 3,580 1.7 3,623 1.8 Total consumer banking 71,439 34.3 70,762 35.9 Commercial Banking: (3) Commercial and multifamily real estate 23,137 11.1 % 20,750 10.5 % Commercial and industrial 26,972 12.9 23,309 11.8 Total commercial lending 50,109 24.0 44,059 22.3 Small-ticket commercial real estate 781 0.4 952 0.5 Total commercial banking 50,890 24.4 45,011 22.8 Other: Other loans 111 0.1 121 0.1 Total loans held for investment (3) $ 208,316 100.0 % $ 197,199 100.0 % __________ (1) Includes installment loans of $144 million and $323 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. (2) Includes acquired home loans of $23.2 billion and $28.2 billion as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. (3) Includes construction loans and land development loans totaling $2.3 billion and $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. We market our credit card products throughout the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. Our credit card loan portfolio is geographically diversified due to our product and marketing approach, with higher concentrations in California, New York, Texas, Florida, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Our auto loan portfolio is originated in most regions of the United States with a concentration in Texas, California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Illinois and Ohio. Our home loan portfolio is concentrated in California, New York, Illinois, Maryland, Virginia, New Jersey and Florida, which reflects the characteristics of the ING Direct portfolio that comprises the majority of our home loans. Retail banking includes small business loans and other consumer lending products originated through our branch network with a concentration in Louisiana, New York, Texas, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia and California. We operate our Commercial Banking business primarily in geographic regions where we maintain retail bank branches. Accordingly, the portfolio is concentrated in New York, Louisiana and Texas, which represent our largest retail banking markets. Our small ticket commercial real estate portfolio, which was originated on a national basis through a broker network, is in a run-off mode. We provide additional information on the geographic concentration, by loan category, of our loan portfolio in Note 4 Loans. Acquired Loans Our portfolio of loans held for investment includes loans acquired in the ING Direct, CCB and 2012 U.S. card acquisitions. These loans were recorded at fair value at the date of each acquisition. Acquired Loans accounted for based on expected cash flows to be collected was $23.5 billion as of December 31, 2014 , compared to $28.6 billion as of December 31, 2013 . The difference between the fair value at acquisition and expected cash flows represents the accretable yield, which is recognized in interest income over the life of the loans. The difference between the contractual payments on the loans and expected cash flows represents the nonaccretable difference or the amount of principal and interest not considered collectible, which incorporates future expected credit losses over the life of the loans. We regularly update our estimate of expected principal and interest to be collected from these loans and evaluate the results for each accounting pool that was established at acquisition based on loans with common risk characteristics. Probable decreases in expected cash flows would trigger the recognition of an allowance for loan and lease 80 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents losses through our provision for credit losses. Probable and significant increases in expected cash flows would first reverse any previously recorded allowance for loan and lease losses established subsequent to acquisition, with any remaining increase in expected cash flows recognized prospectively in interest income over the remaining estimated life of the underlying loans. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional information on Acquired Loans. Home Loans The substantial majority of our home loan portfolio was acquired in the ING Direct and CCB acquisitions, and they accounted for 98.9% and 98.7% of our total Acquired Loans as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The expected cash flows for our acquired home loan portfolio are significantly impacted by future expectations of home prices and interest rates. Decreases in expected cash flows that result from declining conditions, particularly associated with these variables, could result in an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses and reduction in accretable yield. Charge-offs on these loans are not recorded until the expected credit losses within the nonaccretable difference is depleted. In addition, Acquired Loans are not initially classified as delinquent or nonperforming as we expect to collect our net investment in these loans and the nonaccretable difference is expected to absorb the majority of the losses associated with these loans. The period-end carrying value of Acquired Loans in our home loan portfolio was $23.2 billion and $28.2 billion as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Table 17 presents the relative size of Acquired Loans in our home loan portfolio, by lien priority.

The analysis reflects a hypothetical decline of 10% in the home price index and its impact on lifetime future cash flow expectations, accretable yield and allowance for loan and lease losses. Any significant economic events or variables not considered could impact results that are presented below.

Changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses would be recognized immediately in the provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of income. Loan Maturity Profile Table 19 presents the maturities of loans in our held-for-investment portfolio as of December 31, 2014 . Table 19 : Loan Maturity Schedule December 31, 2014 (Dollars in millions) Due Up to 1 Year > 1 Year to 5 Years > 5 Years Total Fixed rate: Credit card (1) $ 4,865 $ 13,871 $ $ 18,736 Consumer banking 812 26,598 17,558 44,968 Commercial banking 1,121 5,303 6,969 13,393 Other 7 7 Total fixed-rate loans 6,798 45,772 24,534 77,104 Variable rate: Credit card (1) 67,131 9 67,140 Consumer banking (2) 13,698 12,455 318 26,471 Commercial banking 34,981 2,345 171 37,497 Other 68 7 29 104 Total variable-rate loans 115,878 14,816 518 131,212 Total loans $ 122,676 $ 60,588 $ 25,052 $ 208,316 __________ (1) Due to the revolving nature of credit card loans, we report the majority of our variable-rate credit card loans as due in one year or less. We report fixed-rate credit card loans with introductory rates that expire after a certain period of time as due in one year or less. We assume that the rest of our remaining fixed-rate credit card loans will mature within one to three years. (2) We report the maturity period for the home loans portfolio included in the Consumer Banking business based on the earlier of the next re-pricing or contractual maturity date of the loan. Credit Risk Measurement We closely monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to assess and manage our exposure to credit risk. Key metrics we track in evaluating the credit quality of our loan portfolio include delinquency and nonperforming asset rates, as well as net charge-off rates and our internal risk ratings of larger balance commercial loans. Trends in delinquency rates are a primary indicator of credit risk within our consumer loan portfolios, as changes in delinquency rates provide an early warning of changes in credit losses. The primary indicator of credit risk in our commercial loan portfolios is our internal risk ratings. Because we generally classify loans that have been delinquent for an extended period of time and other loans with significant risk of loss as nonperforming, the level of nonperforming assets represents another indicator of the potential for future credit losses. In addition to delinquency rates, the geographic distribution of our loans provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio based on regional economic conditions. 82 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents We underwrite most consumer loans using proprietary models, which are typically based on credit bureau data, including borrower credit scores, along with application information and, where applicable, collateral, and deal structure data. We continuously adjust our management of credit lines and collection strategies based on customer behavior and risk profile changes. We use borrower credit scores for subprime classification, for competitive benchmarking, and in some cases to drive product segmentation decisions. The following table provides details on the credit scores of our domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios. Table 20 : Credit Score Distribution (Percentage of portfolio with estimated credit scores) December 31, 2014 December 31, 2013 Domestic credit card - Refreshed FICO scores: (1) Greater than 660 68 % 69 % 660 or below 32 31 Total 100 % 100 % Auto - At origination FICO scores: (2) Greater than 660 47 % 42 % 621 - 660 17 17 620 or below 36 41 Total 100 % 100 % __________ (1) Credit scores generally represent FICO scores. These scores are obtained from one of the major credit bureaus at origination and are refreshed monthly thereafter. We approximate non-FICO credit scores to comparable FICO scores for consistency. Balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 660 or below category. (2) Credit scores represent FICO scores. These scores are obtained from three credit bureaus at the time of application and are not refreshed thereafter. The FICO score distribution in the table above is based on the average scores. Balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 620 or below category. We present information in the section below on the credit performance of our loan portfolio, including the key metrics we use in tracking changes in the credit quality of our loan portfolio. We also present adjusted credit quality metrics excluding the impact from Acquired Loans. See Note 4 Loans in this Report for additional credit quality information. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for information on our accounting policies for delinquent, nonperforming loans, net charge-offs and TDRs for each of our loan categories. Delinquency Rates We consider the entire balance of an account to be delinquent if the minimum required payment is not received by the customer due date, measured at the reporting date. Our 30+ day delinquency metrics include all loans held for investment that are 30 or more days past due, whereas our 30+ day performing delinquency metrics include loans that are 30 or more days past due but currently classified as performing and accruing interest. The 30+ day delinquency and 30+ day performing delinquency metrics are generally the same for credit card loans, as we continue to classify the substantial majority of credit card loans as performing until the account is charged-off, typically when the account is 180 days past due. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for information on our policies for classifying loans as nonperforming for each of our loan categories. 83 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 21 presents our 30+ day performing delinquency rates and 30+ day delinquency rates of our portfolio of loans held for investment, including Acquired Loans, by portfolio segment, as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 .

These loans consist primarily of credit card accounts between 90 days and 179 days past due. As permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the FFIEC, we generally continue to accrue interest and fees on domestic credit card loans through the date of charge-off, which is typically in the period the account becomes 180 days past due. While domestic credit card loans typically remain on accrual status until the loan is charged-off, we reduce the balance of our credit card receivables by the amount of finance charges and fees billed but not expected to be collected and exclude this amount from revenue.

Nonperforming Loans and Nonperforming Assets Nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans, foreclosed property and repossessed assets and the net realizable value of auto loans that have been charged-off as a result of a bankruptcy. Nonperforming loans generally include loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status and certain restructured loans whose contractual terms have been modified in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for information on our policies for classifying loans as nonperforming for each of our loan categories. 85 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 24 presents comparative information on nonperforming loans, by portfolio segment, and other nonperforming assets, as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 . We do not classify loans held for sale as nonperforming, as they are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value.

Interest income forgone related to nonperforming loans was $49 million and $55 million in 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Forgone interest income represents the amount of interest income that would have been recorded during the period for nonperforming loans as of the end of the period had the loans performed according to their contractual terms. (2) The nonperforming loan ratio, excluding Acquired Loans impact for our home loan portfolio, total consumer banking, and total nonperforming loans held for investment was 4.86%, 1.14%, and 0.44%, respectively, as of December 31, 2014 , compared to 5.29%, 1.44%, and 0.51%, respectively, as of December 31, 2013 . (3) Nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans held for investment, excluding the impact of domestic credit card loans, was 0.62% and 0.70% as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. (4) The denominator used in calculating the nonperforming asset ratios consists of total loans held for investment and other nonperforming assets. (5) Includes foreclosed properties related to Acquired Loans of $101 million and $68 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. (6) Includes the net realizable value of auto loans that have been charged-off as a result of a bankruptcy and repossessed assets obtained in satisfaction of auto loans. 86 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Net Charge-Offs Net charge-offs consist of the unpaid principal balance of loans held for investment that we determine are uncollectible, net of recovered amounts. We exclude accrued and unpaid finance charges and fees and fraud losses from charge-offs. Net charge-offs are recorded as a reduction to the allowance for loan and lease losses and subsequent recoveries of previously charged-off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan and lease losses. Costs incurred to recover charged-off loans are recorded as collection expenses and included in our consolidated statements of income as a component of other non-interest expense. Our charge-off policy for loans varies based on the loan type. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for information on our charge-off policy for each of our loan categories. Table 25 presents our net charge-off amounts and rates, by portfolio segment, in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 .

For information regarding management expectations of net charge-offs, see MD&A Business Segment Expectations. 87 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Loan Modifications and Restructurings As part of our loss mitigation efforts, we may provide short-term (three to twelve months) or long-term (greater than twelve months) modifications to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty to improve long-term collectability of the loan and to avoid the need for foreclosure or repossession of collateral. Table 26 presents our loans modified in TDRs as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 . It excludes loan modifications that do not meet the definition of a TDR and Acquired Loans accounted for based on expected cash flows, which we track and report separately. Table 26 : Loan Modifications and Restructurings December 31, 2014 December 31, 2013 (Dollars in millions) Amount % of Total Modifications Amount % of Total Modifications Modified and restructured loans: Credit card (1) $ 692 41.9 % $ 780 46.4 % Consumer banking: Auto 435 26.3 355 21.1 Home loan 218 13.2 244 14.5 Retail banking 35 2.1 64 3.8 Total consumer banking 688 41.6 663 39.4 Commercial banking 272 16.5 238 14.2 Total $ 1,652 100.0 % $ 1,681 100.0 % Status of modified and restructured loans: Performing $ 1,203 72.8 % $ 1,250 74.4 % Nonperforming 449 27.2 431 25.6 Total $ 1,652 100.0 % $ 1,681 100.0 % __________ (1) Amount reflects the total outstanding customer balance, which consists of unpaid principal balance, accrued interest and fees. The majority of our credit card TDRs involve reducing the interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months. We determine the effective interest rate for purposes of measuring impairment on modified loans that involve a reduction and are considered to be a TDR based on the interest rate in effect immediately prior to the loan entering the modification program. In some cases, the interest rate on a credit card account is automatically increased due to non-payment, late payment or similar events. In all cases, we cancel the customer available line of credit on the credit card. If the customer does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan agreement may revert to its original payment terms, with the amount of any loan outstanding reflected in the appropriate delinquency category. The loan amount may then be charged off in accordance with our standard charge-off policy. Within the Consumer Banking business, the majority of our modified loans receive an extension, while a portion receive an interest rate reduction or principal reduction. Their impairment is determined using the present value of expected cash flows, or a collateral evaluation for auto and home loans that were charged down to fair value. In the Commercial Banking business, the majority of modified loans receive an extension, with a portion of these loans receiving an interest rate reduction. The impairment on modified commercial loans is generally determined based on the underlying collateral value. We provide additional information on modified loans accounted for as TDRs, including the performance of those loans subsequent to modification, in Note 4 Loans . Impaired Loans A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due from the borrower in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan. Generally, we report loans as impaired based on the method for measuring impairment in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. Loans defined as individually impaired include larger balance commercial nonperforming loans and TDRs. Loans held for sale are not reported as impaired, as these loans are recorded at lower of cost or fair value. Impaired loans also exclude Acquired Loans accounted for based on expected cash flows because this accounting methodology takes into consideration future credit losses expected to be incurred, as discussed above under Summary of Selected Financial Data. 88 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Impaired loans, including TDRs, totaled $1.9 billion as of both December 31, 2014 and 2013 . TDRs accounted for $1.7 billion of impaired loans as of both December 31, 2014 and 2013 . We provide additional information on our impaired loans, including the allowance for loan and lease losses established for these loans, in Note 4 Loans and Note 5 Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses . Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Our allowance for loan and lease losses represents management best estimate of incurred loan and lease credit losses inherent in our held for investment portfolio as of each balance sheet date. The allowance for loan and lease losses is increased through the provision for credit losses and reduced by net charge-offs. We provide additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used in determining our allowance for loan and lease losses in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . Our allowance for loan and lease losses increased by $68 million to $4.4 billion as of December 31, 2014 , from $4.3 billion as of December 31, 2013 . The allowance coverage ratio declined to 2.10% as of December 31, 2014 , from 2.19% as of December 31, 2013 . The increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses was primarily driven by loan growth in our domestic card, auto and commercial loan portfolios, in addition to portfolio specific risks in our commercial loan portfolio, offset by credit improvement driving allowance releases related to our international card portfolio. Table 27 presents changes in our allowance for loan and lease losses for 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , and details the provision for credit losses recognized in our consolidated statements of income, and charge-offs and recoveries by portfolio segment. 89 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 27 : Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Activity Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2014 2013 2012 Balance at beginning of period $ 4,315 $ 5,156 $ 4,250 Provision for credit losses (1) 3,515 3,401 4,446 Charge-offs: Credit Card: Domestic credit card (3,476 ) (3,969 ) (3,507 ) International credit card (487 ) (573 ) (652 ) Total credit card (3,963 ) (4,542 ) (4,159 ) Consumer Banking: Auto (898 ) (784 ) (631 ) Home loan (32 ) (26 ) (77 ) Retail banking (59 ) (78 ) (89 ) Total consumer banking (989 ) (888 ) (797 ) Commercial Banking: Commercial and multifamily real estate (5 ) (6 ) (23 ) Commercial and industrial (23 ) (26 ) (32 ) Total commercial lending (28 ) (32 ) (55 ) Small-ticket commercial real estate (6 ) (17 ) (39 ) Total commercial banking (34 ) (49 ) (94 ) Other loans (10 ) (26 ) (43 ) Total charge-offs (4,996 ) (5,505 ) (5,093 ) Recoveries: Credit Card: Domestic credit card 1,031 1,065 975 International credit card 204 192 240 Total credit card 1,235 1,257 1,215 Consumer Banking: Auto 279 238 217 Home loan 15 10 25 Retail banking 20 24 24 Total consumer banking 314 272 266 Commercial Banking: Commercial and multifamily real estate 10 14 18 Commercial and industrial 13 11 25 Total commercial lending 23 25 43 Small-ticket commercial real estate 1 10 9 Total commercial banking 24 35 52 Other loans 9 7 5 Total recoveries 1,582 1,571 1,538 Net charge-offs (3,414 ) (3,934 ) (3,555 ) Other changes (2) (33 ) (308 ) 15 Balance at end of period $ 4,383 $ 4,315 $ 5,156 Allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loans held for investment 2.10 % 2.19 % 2.50 % __________ (1) The total provision for credit losses reported in our consolidated statements of income consists of a provision for loan and lease losses and a provision for unfunded lending commitments.

LIQUIDITY RISK PROFILE We have established liquidity practices that are intended to ensure we have sufficient asset-based liquidity to withstand the potential impact of deposit attrition or diminished liquidity in the funding markets. Our practices include maintaining an adequate liquidity reserve to cover our funding requirements as well as any potential deposit run-off and maintaining access to diversified funding sources to avoid over-dependence on volatile, less reliable funding markets. Our liquidity reserves consist of readily-marketable or pledgable assets which can be used as a source of liquidity, if needed. 91 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 29 below presents the composition of our liquidity reserves as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 .

(2) We pledged securities available for sale with a fair value of $3.5 billion and $10.7 billion as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. We also pledged securities held to maturity with a carrying value of $9.0 billion and $8.2 billion as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. As of December 31, 2014 , $14 million of the pledged securities available for sale were used to secure our FHLB borrowing capacity. Our liquidity reserves increased by $1.9 billion , or 3% , to $71.6 billion as of December 31, 2014 , from $69.7 billion as of December 31, 2013 . This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the fair value of our investment securities, partially offset by higher FHLB advances to fund the growth of our credit card portfolio. See MD&A Risk Management for additional information on our management of liquidity risk. Funding The Company primary source of funding comes from deposits. In addition to deposits, the Company raises funding through the purchase of federal funds, the issuance of brokered deposits, FHLB advances secured by certain portions of our loan and securities portfolios, the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, the issuance of securitized debt obligations and other borrowings. A key objective in our use of these markets is to ensure we maintain access to a diversified mix of wholesale funding sources. Deposits Our deposits provide a stable and relatively low cost of funds and are our largest source of funding.

(2) Includes Money Market Deposit Accounts ( MMDA ). (3) Substantially all of our foreign time deposits were greater than $100,000 as of December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 . Our deposits include brokered deposits, which we obtained through the use of third-party intermediaries. Those brokered deposits are reported as saving deposits and time deposits in the above table and totaled $5.1 billion and $6.0 billion as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The FDIC limits the use of brokered deposits to well-capitalized insured depository institutions and, with a waiver from the FDIC, to adequately capitalized institutions. COBNA and CONA were well-capitalized, as defined under the federal banking regulatory guidelines, as of both December 31, 2014 , and 2013 and therefore were permitted to maintain brokered deposits. 93 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 31 presents the contractual maturities of large-denomination domestic time deposits of $100,000 or more as of December 31, 2014 and 2013. Our funding and liquidity management activities factor into the expected maturities of these deposits. Based on past activity, we expect to retain a portion of these deposits as they mature. Accordingly, we expect the actual net cash outflows will be less than the contractual maturity amounts.

In addition, we may utilize short-term and long-term FHLB advances secured by our investment securities, residential home loans, multifamily real estate loans, commercial real estate loans and home equity lines of credit. Our short-term borrowings include those borrowings with an original contractual maturity of one year or less and do not include the current portion of long-term debt. The short-term borrowings, which consist of federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, and short-term FHLB advances, increased by $865 million in 2014 , to $17.1 billion as of December 31, 2014 , from $16.2 billion as of December 31, 2013 . This increase reflects $40.1 billion in new FHLB advances, partially offset by $39.2 billion in payoffs in 2014 . Our long-term debt, which consists of securitized debt obligations, senior and subordinated notes, and long-term FHLB advances, increased by $7.0 billion in 2014 , to $31.4 billion as of December 31, 2014 , from $24.4 billion as of December 31, 2013 . The increase was primarily attributable to new senior unsecured debt issuances of $7.8 billion and securitized debt issuances of $4.3 billion , partially offset by $2.4 billion and $3.0 billion of senior and subordinated note and securitized debt maturities, respectively. Table 32 provides the average balance and average interest rate of our short-term borrowings for 2014 , 2013 and 2012 .

We provide additional information on our short-term borrowings and long-term debt under Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis Securitized Debt Obligations, Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis Other Debt and in Note 9 Deposits and Borrowings . Borrowing Capacity We filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC on April 30, 2012, which expires in April 2015. Under this shelf registration, we may periodically offer and sell an indeterminate aggregate amount of senior or subordinated debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock, purchase contracts, warrants and units. There is no limit under this shelf registration statement to the amount or number of such securities that we may offer and sell, subject to market conditions. We expect to file a new shelf registration statement prior to the expiration of our existing shelf registration statement. In addition to our issuance capacity under the shelf registration statement, we also have access to FHLB advances with a maximum borrowing capacity of $29.6 billion as of December 31, 2014 , of which $11.8 billion was still available to us to borrow as of December 31, 2014 . To secure this borrowing capacity, we pledged loan collateral with an outstanding balance of $36.7 billion 95 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents and security collateral with a fair value of $14 million as of December 31, 2014 . The ability to draw down funding is based on membership status and the amount is dependent upon the Banks ability to post collateral. Our FHLB membership is secured by our investment in FHLB stock of $807 million and $774 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, which are determined in part based on our outstanding advances. We also have access to the Federal Reserve Discount Window through which we had borrowing capacity of $9.3 billion as of December 31, 2014. Although available, we do not view this borrowing capacity as a primary source of liquidity and did not utilize it during 2014 or 2013. Credit Ratings Our credit ratings have a significant impact on our ability to access capital markets and our non-deposit borrowing costs. Rating agencies base their ratings on numerous factors, including liquidity, capital adequacy, asset quality, quality of earnings and the probability of systemic support. Significant changes in these factors could result in different ratings. Such ratings help to support our cost effective unsecured funding as part of our overall financing programs. Table 34 provides a summary of the credit ratings for the senior unsecured debt of Capital One Financial Corporation, COBNA and CONA as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 .

Contractual Obligations In the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments that affect our short- and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. Our future cash outflows primarily relate to deposits, borrowings and operating leases. Table 35 summarizes, by remaining contractual maturity, our significant contractual cash obligations based on the undiscounted future cash payments as of December 31, 2014 . The actual timing and amounts of future cash payments may differ from the amounts presented below due to a number of factors, such as discretionary debt repurchases. Table 35 excludes certain obligations where the obligation is short-term or subject to valuation based on market factors, such as trade payables and trading liabilities. The table also excludes the representation and warranty reserve of $731 million as of December 31, 2014 and obligations for pension and post-retirement benefit plans, which are discussed in more detail in Note 16 Employee Benefit Plans .

See Note 20 Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others for further details. MARKET RISK PROFILE Market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities, including loans, deposits, securities, short-term borrowings, long-term debt and derivatives. Below we provide additional information about our primary sources of market risk, our market risk management strategies and the measures we use to evaluate our market risk exposure. Primary Market Risk Exposures Our primary source of market risk is interest rate risk. We also have exposure to foreign exchange risk. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk, which represents exposure to instruments whose yield or price varies with the volatility of interest rates, is our most significant source of market risk exposure. Banks are inevitably exposed to interest rate risk due to differences in the timing between the maturities or repricing of assets and liabilities. Foreign Exchange Risk Foreign exchange risk represents exposure to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in other currencies. Our primary exposure is related to the funding of and non-dollar net investments in our International Card business in the U.K and Canada. Our intercompany funding exposes our income statement to foreign exchange transaction risk, while our equity investments in our foreign operations results in translation risk in AOCI. We manage our transaction risk by entering into forward foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to variability in cash flows related to foreign currency denominated intercompany borrowings. In the third quarter of 2014, we began entering into net investment hedges to manage our AOCI exposure. We apply hedge accounting to these net investment hedges. We measure our total exposure by regularly tracking the value of our net equity invested in our foreign operations as well as their funding requirements. Also, beginning in the third quarter of 2014, we revised our methodology to measure our exposure to foreign exchange rates by measuring the change in equity value of our net investments in our U.K. and Canadian operations. We apply a 30 percent U.S. dollar appreciation shock against each of our Great British Pound ( GBP ) and Canadian Dollar ( CAD ) net investment exposure. This value-at-risk analysis approximates a 99 percent confidence interval over a one year time horizon for our combined GBP and CAD net investment exposure. As of December 31, 2014 our gross equity exposures were 1.3 billion GBP and 581 million CAD. As a result of our derivative management activities, we believe our net exposure to foreign exchange risk is minimal. Our gross equity exposures as of December 31, 2013 were 1.2 billion GBP and 655 million CAD. Market Risk Management We employ several techniques to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk, which include, but are not limited to, altering the duration and re-pricing characteristics of our various assets and liabilities through interest rate derivatives or mitigating the foreign exchange exposure of certain non-dollar denominated equity or transactions through derivatives. Derivatives are one of the primary tools we use in managing interest rate and foreign exchange risk. Our current asset/liability management policy includes the use of derivatives. We execute our derivative contracts in both over-the-counter and exchange-traded derivative markets. Although the majority of our derivatives are interest rate swaps, we also use a variety of other derivative instruments, including caps, floors, options, futures and forward contracts, to manage both our interest rate and foreign currency risk. The outstanding notional amount of our derivative contracts totaled $88.6 billion as of December 31, 2014 , compared to $63.4 billion as of December 31, 2013 , driven by an increase in our hedging activities. 97 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Market Risk Measurement We have prescribed risk management policies and limits established by our Market and Liquidity Risk Policy and approved by the Board of Directors. Our objective is to manage our asset/liability risk position and exposure to market risk in accordance with these policies and prescribed limits based on prevailing market conditions and long-term expectations. Because no single measure can reflect all aspects of market risk, we use various industry standard market risk measurement techniques and analysis to measure, assess and manage the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and our economic value of equity and foreign exchange rates on our non-dollar denominated earnings and non-dollar equity investments in foreign operations. We provide additional information below in Economic Value of Equity. We consider the impact on both net interest income and economic value of equity in measuring and managing our interest rate risk. Because the federal funds rate was lowered to near zero in December 2008 and since then has remained in a target range of 0% to 0.25%, we use a 50 basis points decrease as our declining interest rate scenario, since a scenario where interest rates would decline by 200 basis points is unlikely. In scenarios where a 50 basis points decline would result in a rate less than 0%, we assume a rate of 0%. Below we discuss the assumptions used in calculating each of these measures. Net Interest Income Sensitivity This sensitivity measure estimates the impact on our projected 12-month base-line interest rate sensitive revenue resulting from movements in interest rates. Interest rate sensitive revenue consists of net interest income and certain components of other non-interest income significantly impacted by movements in interest rates, including changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights and free-standing interest rate swaps. Adjusted net interest income consists of net interest income and changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, including related derivative hedging activity, and changes in the fair value of free-standing interest rate swaps. In addition to our existing assets and liabilities, we incorporate expected future business growth assumptions, such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, and plans for projected changes in our funding mix in our baseline forecast. In measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our projected interest rate sensitive revenue, we assume an instantaneous plus 200 basis points and minus 50 basis points shock, with the lower rate scenario limited to zero as described above. Economic Value of Equity Our economic value of equity sensitivity measure estimates the impact on the net present value of our assets and liabilities, including derivative hedging activity, resulting from movements in interest rates. Our economic value of equity sensitivity measures are calculated based on our existing assets and liabilities, including derivatives, and do not incorporate business growth assumptions or projected plans for funding mix changes. In measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our economic value of equity, we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates of +200 basis points and -50 basis points to spot rates, with the lower rate scenario limited to zero as described above. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we updated the models and associated assumptions for certain deposits in our Consumer Banking business. Our new deposit model was developed based on account-level data and incorporates lagged responses in both repricing and customer behavior as external market rates change. The modeling changes had a small impact on our economic value of equity sensitivity measure, but resulted in a larger impact to our next 12-month net interest income sensitivity. Accordingly, our net interest income sensitivity metric shows more asset sensitivity over the first 12 months, moving from 3.4% in a +200 basis point instantaneous parallel shock shift (under the previous methodology) to 4.5% using the new deposit model. 98 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 36 shows the estimated percentage impact on our projected base-line net interest income and economic value of equity as of December 31, 2014 , calculated under the revised methodology described above. It also includes an estimate of the measures as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 calculated under the previous methodology.

In addition to these industry standard measures, we will continue to factor into our internal interest rate risk management decisions the potential impact of alternative interest rate scenarios, such as stressed rate shocks as well as steepening and flattening yield curve scenarios. Limitations of Market Risk Measures The interest rate risk models that we use in deriving these measures incorporate contractual information, internally-developed assumptions and proprietary modeling methodologies, which project borrower and depositor behavior patterns in certain interest rate environments. Other market inputs, such as interest rates, market prices and interest rate volatility, are also critical components of our interest rate risk measures. We regularly evaluate, update and enhance these assumptions, models and analytical tools as we believe appropriate to reflect our best assessment of the market environment and the expected behavior patterns of our existing assets and liabilities. There are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates. The above sensitivity analysis contemplates only certain movements in interest rates and is performed at a particular point in time based on the existing balance sheet and, in some cases, expected future business growth and funding mix assumptions. The strategic actions that management may take to manage our balance sheet may differ significantly from our projections, which could cause our actual earnings and economic value of equity sensitivities to differ substantially from the above sensitivity analysis. 99 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents SUPPLEMENTAL TABLES Table A Loan Portfolio Composition December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 Loans held for investment: Credit Card: Domestic credit card (1) $ 77,704 $ 73,255 $ 83,141 $ 56,609 $ 53,849 International credit card 8,172 8,050 8,614 8,466 7,522 Total credit card 85,876 81,305 91,755 65,075 61,371 Consumer Banking: Auto 37,824 31,857 27,123 21,779 17,867 Home loan 30,035 35,282 44,100 10,433 12,103 Retail banking 3,580 3,623 3,904 4,103 4,413 Total consumer banking 71,439 70,762 75,127 36,315 34,383 Commercial Banking: Commercial and multifamily real estate 23,137 20,750 17,732 15,736 13,619 Commercial and industrial 26,972 23,309 19,892 17,088 14,504 Total commercial lending 50,109 44,059 37,624 32,824 28,123 Small-ticket commercial real estate 781 952 1,196 1,503 1,842 Total commercial banking 50,890 45,011 38,820 34,327 29,965 Other: Other loans 111 121 187 175 228 Total loans held for investment $ 208,316 $ 197,199 $ 205,889 $ 135,892 $ 125,947 __________ (1) Includes installment loans of $144 million , $323 million , $813 million, $1.9 billion and $3.9 billion as of December 31, 2014 , 2013 , 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. 100 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table B Performing Delinquencies December 31, 2014 (1) 2013 (1) 2012 (1) 2011 (1) 2010 (1) (Dollars in millions) Loans (2)(3) % of Total Loans (4) Loans (2)(3) % of Total Loans (4) Loans (2)(3) % of Total Loans (4) Loans (2)(3) % of Total Loans (4) Loans (2)(3) % of Total Loans (4) Loans held for investment $ 208,316 100.00 % $ 197,199 100.00 % $ 205,889 100.00 % $ 135,892 100.00 % $ 125,947 100.00 % Delinquent loans: 30-59 days $ 2,803 1.34 % $ 2,584 1.31 % $ 2,629 1.28 % $ 2,267 1.67 % $ 1,968 1.56 % 60-89 days 1,394 0.67 1,313 0.67 1,399 0.68 1,043 0.77 1,064 0.85 90-119 days 508 0.24 512 0.26 628 0.30 497 0.36 559 0.44 120-149 days 409 0.20 418 0.21 485 0.24 390 0.29 446 0.36 150 or more days 346 0.17 361 0.18 414 0.20 355 0.26 393 0.31 Total $ 5,460 2.62 % $ 5,188 2.63 % $ 5,555 2.70 % $ 4,552 3.35 % $ 4,430 3.52 % By geographic area: Domestic $ 5,220 2.50 % $ 4,889 2.48 % $ 5,247 2.55 % $ 4,114 3.03 % $ 3,998 3.18 % International 240 0.12 299 0.15 308 0.15 438 0.32 432 0.34 Total $ 5,460 2.62 % $ 5,188 2.63 % $ 5,555 2.70 % $ 4,552 3.35 % $ 4,430 3.52 % __________ (1) Acquired Loans are included in loans held for investment, but excluded from delinquent loans as these loans are considered performing in accordance with our expectations as of the purchase date, as we recorded these loans at estimated fair value when we acquired them.

(collectively, HSBC ), we closed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and assumed liabilities of HSBC credit card and private label credit card business in the United States (other than the HSBC Bank USA, consumer credit card program and certain other retained assets and liabilities). Acquired Loans: Refers to the substantial majority of consumer and commercial loans acquired in the ING Direct and Chevy Chase Bank acquisitions, and a limited portion of the credit card loans acquired in the 2012 U.S. card acquisition, which were recorded at fair value at acquisition and subsequently accounted for based on expected cash flows to be collected (under the accounting standard formerly known as Statement of Position 03-3, Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer , commonly referred to as SOP 03-3 or ASC 310-30 ). The difference between the fair value at acquisition and expected cash flows represents the accretable yield, which is recognized into interest income over the life of the loans. The difference between the contractual payments on the loans and expected cash flows represents the nonaccretable difference or the amount of principal and interest not considered collectible, which incorporates future expected credit losses over the life of the loans. Decreases in expected cash flows from the previous estimate resulting from further credit deterioration will generally result in an impairment charge recognized in our provision for credit losses and an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses. Charge-offs are not recorded until the expected credit losses within the nonaccretable difference is depleted. In addition, Acquired Loans are not classified as delinquent or nonperforming as we expect to collect our net investment in these loans and the nonaccretable difference will absorb the majority of the losses associated with these loans. Annual Report: References to our 2014 Form 10-K or 2014 Annual Report or this Report are to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014. Banks: Refers to COBNA and CONA. Basel Committee: The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. Basel III Advanced Approaches: The Basel III Advanced Approaches is mandatory for those institutions with consolidated total assets of $250 billion or more or consolidated total on-balance-sheet foreign exposure of $10 million or more. The Final Rule modified the Advanced Approaches version of Basel II to create the Basel III Advanced Approaches. Basel III Standardized Approach: The Final Rule modified Basel I to create the Basel III Standardized Approach, which requires for Basel III Advanced Approaches banking organizations that have yet to exit parallel run to use the Basel III Standardized Approach to calculate regulatory capital, including capital ratios, subject to transition provisions. Benefit Obligation and Projected Benefit Obligation: Benefit Obligation refers to the total of the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations. Projected Benefit Obligation represents the actuarial present value of all benefits accrued on employee service rendered prior to the calculation date, including allowance for future salary increases if the pension benefit is based on future compensation levels. BHC Act: The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (12 U.S.C. 1842). Capital One: Capital One Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries. Carrying Value (with respect to loans) : The amount at which a loan is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. For loans recorded at amortized cost, carrying value is the unpaid principal balance net of unamortized deferred loan origination fees and costs, and unamortized purchase premium or discount. For loans that are or have been on nonaccrual status, the carrying value is also reduced by any net charge-offs that have been recorded and the amount of interest payments applied as a reduction of principal under the cost recovery method. For credit card loans, the carrying value also includes interest that has been billed to the customer. For loans classified as held for sale, carrying value is the lower of carrying value as described in the sentences above, or fair value. For Acquired Loans, the carrying value equals fair value upon acquisition adjusted for subsequent cash collections and yield accreted to date.
