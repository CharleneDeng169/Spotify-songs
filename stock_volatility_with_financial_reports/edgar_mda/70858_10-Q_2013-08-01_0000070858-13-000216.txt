MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This report on Form 10-Q, the documents that it incorporates by reference and the documents into which it may be incorporated by reference may contain, and from time to time Bank of America Corporation (collectively with its subsidiaries, the Corporation) and its management may make certain statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as "expects," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "targets," "intends," "plans," "goal" and other similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as "will," "may," "might," "should," "would" and "could." The forward-looking statements made represent the current expectations, plans or forecasts of the Corporation regarding the Corporation's future results and revenues, and future business and economic conditions more generally, including statements concerning: expectations regarding European and certain Asian economies; the expectation that, if the pace of improvement in the economy continues, there will be reductions in the allowance for credit losses; expected levels of net charge-offs; expectations regarding the impact of interest rate increases on future net interest income, accumulated OCI and mortgage loan originations; expectations regarding the anticipated transfers of mortgage servicing rights; expectations regarding planned actions pursuant to the Corporation's capital plan; the expectation that borrower assistance programs will not result in any incremental credit provision and that the existing allowance for credit losses is adequate to absorb any costs that have not already been recorded as charge-offs; expectations of achieving cost savings as a result of Project New BAC of $8 billion per year on an annualized basis, or $2 billion per quarter, by mid-2015, with $1.5 billion in quarterly cost savings achieved by the fourth quarter of 2013; expectations regarding the impact of U.K. corporate income tax rate reductions on the Corporation's income tax expense and regulatory capital ratios; expectations that, in the fourth quarter of 2013, noninterest expense in Legacy Assets & Servicing (excluding litigation expense) will be below $2.0 billion and the number of 60 days or more past due residential mortgage loans in the Legacy and Non-Legacy Mortgage Serviced Portfolios will decline below 375,000; the expectation that unresolved repurchase claims related to private-label securitizations will continue to increase; the resolution of representation and warranties repurchase and other claims; the possibility of additional settlements in the future; the belief that there will likely be additional requests for loan files in the future leading to repurchase claims; the possibility that the Corporation may purchase common stock and outstanding debt securities depending on prevailing market conditions, liquidity and other factors; beliefs and expectations concerning the impact of the National Mortgage Settlement, including the impact of uniform servicing standards; predictions concerning the impact of possible foreclosure delays; the possibility that the Corporation will need to register additional entities as swap dealers and major swap participants; the possibility that the Corporation will be required to restructure certain businesses as a result of final derivatives regulations that impose additional operational and compliance costs; expectations regarding the planned merger of certain pension plans, including its effect on the Corporation's regulatory capital; expectations regarding capital requirements under proposed regulatory rulemaking, including the approved final Basel 3 rules, which have not yet been published in the Federal Register, and the possibility of capital distribution-related impacts of these requirements on the Corporation; expectations that the Corporation will meet proposed Basel 3 liquidity standards within the regulatory timelines; the expectation that, if the Corporation's analytical models for capital measurement under Basel 3 are not approved by the U.S. regulatory agencies, it would likely lead to an increase in the Corporation's risk-weighted assets, which in some cases could be significant; expectations regarding benefits to be obtained from the Corporation's centralized funding strategy; estimates concerning the Corporation's additional capital requirements as a global systemically important financial institution; beliefs that default-related servicing costs peaked in late 2012 and will continue to decline in 2013; expectations regarding preferred stock dividends; the Corporation's belief that it can quickly obtain cash for certain securities, even in stressed market conditions, through repurchase agreements or outright sales; the Corporation's belief that a portion of structured liability obligations will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date; the Corporation's anticipation that debt levels will decline due to maturities through 2013; the estimation that lifetime losses on loans originated after 2008 will be significantly less than the losses experienced with respect to vintages prior to 2009; expectations regarding loans in the pay option portfolio; the possibility that the Corporation may add credit exposure within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection; effects of the ongoing debt crisis in certain European countries, including the expectation of continued market volatility, the expectation that the Corporation will continue to support client activities in the region and that exposures may vary over time as the Corporation monitors the situation and manages its risk profile;

However, the economy was adversely affected by the continued impact of lower federal government expenditures. Employment gains were moderate during the quarter, with little change in the unemployment rate. Measures of core inflation also fell during the second quarter of 2013 , with core personal consumption deflator ending the quarter near one percent on an annual basis, well below the longer-term inflation target of two percent set by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve). The Federal Reserve continued its $40 billion in monthly purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and $45 billion in monthly purchases of long-term U.S. Treasury securities and maintained its forward guidance on interest rates expressed in terms of economic thresholds, which began in December 2012. Sequestration became effective on March 1, 2013, which restrained federal expenditures during the second quarter, and remained in effect at quarter-end. Despite remaining fiscal uncertainties and international economic difficulties, U.S. equities posted modest gains at the end of the second quarter. After the Federal Reserve's announcement on June 19, 2013, there was considerable market concern around potential tapering of the bond buying program. This resulted in a rise in long-term U.S. Treasury yields as the yield curve steepened during the second quarter and volatility in interest rate markets increased, which led to an extensive market sell off for interest rate sensitive products including, for example, municipal bonds and MBS. Most European economies continued to contract during the quarter but at a diminishing pace with forward-looking indicators favoring a resumption of growth later in the year. Despite uncertainty ahead of upcoming German elections and continued political uncertainty in Greece, the Eurozone continued to demonstrate a reduced level of financial anxiety. Japan's economy continued to demonstrate signs of economic improvement, although uncertainties remain as to whether the impacts of a depreciating Yen could be sustained with the implementation of longer-term reforms. China's economic growth has slowed as the present leadership clarified a greater emphasis on other objectives such as financial reform, which has slowed the credit markets, therefore posing a risk of slowdown for bordering economies. For more information on our international exposure, see Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 116 . Recent Events Common Stock Repurchases and Liability Management Actions As disclosed in prior filings, the capital plan that the Corporation submitted to the Federal Reserve in January 2013 as part of our 2013 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review project (CCAR), and to which the Federal Reserve did not object, included a request to repurchase up to $5.0 billion of common stock and redeem $5.5 billion in preferred stock over four quarters with both beginning in the second quarter of 2013, and a continuation of the quarterly common stock dividend at $0.01 per share. In the second quarter, we repurchased and retired 79.6 million common shares for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.0 billion and redeemed our Series H and 8 preferred stock for $5.5 billion . In addition to the CCAR actions, during the three months ended June 30, 2013 , we redeemed $76 million of Noncumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series 6 and 7 and issued approximately $1.0 billion of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Semi-annual Preferred Stock, Series U (the Series U Preferred Stock). On August 1, 2013 , we redeemed $951 million of the Corporation's 7.25% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series J (the Series J Preferred Stock). For additional information, see Capital Management Regulatory Capital on page 70 and Note 12 Shareholders' Equity to the Consolidated Financial Statements . 6 Table of Contents Final Basel 3 Rules and Proposed Supplementary Leverage Ratio In July 2013, U.S. banking regulators approved the final Basel 3 rules (Basel 3). While not yet published in the Federal Register, Basel 3 will be effective January 1, 2014. Various aspects of Basel 3 will be subject to multi-year transition periods ending December 31, 2018 and Basel 3 generally continues to be subject to further evaluation and interpretation by the U.S. banking regulators. Basel 3 will materially change our Tier 1 common, Tier 1 and Total capital calculations. Basel 3 introduces new minimum capital ratios and buffer requirements, changes the composition of regulatory capital, expands and modifies the calculation of risk-weighted assets for credit and market risk (the Advanced Approach), revises the adequately capitalized minimum requirements under the Prompt Corrective Action framework and introduces, effective January 1, 2015, a Standardized Approach for the calculation of risk-weighted assets, which will replace the Basel 1 2013 Rules. Under Basel 3, we will be required to calculate regulatory capital ratios and risk-weighted assets under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is to be used to assess capital adequacy including under the Prompt Corrective Action framework. The Prompt Corrective Action framework establishes categories of capitalization, including "well-capitalized," based on regulatory ratio requirements. U.S. banking regulators are required to take certain mandatory actions depending on the category of capitalization, with no mandatory actions required for "well-capitalized" banking entities. We continue to evaluate the impact of both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches on us. The Basel 3 Advanced Approach requires approval by the U.S. regulatory agencies of analytical models used as part of capital measurement. If these models are not approved, it would likely lead to an increase in our risk-weighted assets, which in some cases could be significant. In addition, in July 2013, the U.S. banking regulators also proposed changes to the capital ratio requirements that would be effective beginning in 2018. Under the proposed rule, the largest bank holding companies (BHCs), including the Corporation, would be required to maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of three percent, plus a supplementary leverage buffer of two percent, for a total of five percent . If the Corporation does not maintain the supplementary leverage buffer at a level greater than or equal to two percent , it would be subject to limitations on returning capital distributions to its shareholders, whether through dividends, stock repurchases or otherwise. The proposed rule would also require insured depository institutions of such BHCs, which for the Corporation would include primarily BANA and FIA, to have a six percent supplementary leverage ratio to be considered "well capitalized. The proposal is not yet final and, when finalized, could have provisions significantly different from those currently proposed. For additional information, see Capital Management Regulatory Capital on page 72 . Impact of U.K. Corporate Income Tax Rate Reduction On July 17, 2013 , the United Kingdom (U.K.) 2013 Finance Bill was enacted, which reduced the U.K. corporate income tax rate by three percent to 20 percent. Two percent of the reduction will become effective on April 1, 2014 and the additional one percent reduction on April 1, 2015 . These reductions will favorably affect income tax expense on future U.K. earnings but also require the Corporation to remeasure, in the period of enactment, its U.K. net deferred tax assets using the lower tax rates. As a result, in the three months ending September 30, 2013 , the Corporation will record a charge to income tax expense of approximately $1.1 billion in aggregate for these reductions. Because our deferred tax assets in excess of a certain amount are disallowed in calculating regulatory capital, this charge will not impact our capital ratios. For additional information, see Note 21 Subsequent Event to the Consolidated Financial Statements . 7 Table of Contents MBIA Settlement On May 7, 2013, we entered into a comprehensive settlement with MBIA Inc. and certain of its affiliates (MBIA) to resolve all outstanding litigation between the parties, as well as other claims between the parties, including outstanding and potential claims from MBIA related to alleged representations and warranties breaches and other claims involving certain first- and second-lien residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) trusts for which MBIA provided financial guarantee insurance, certain of which claims were the subject of litigation (MBIA Settlement). Under the MBIA Settlement, all pending litigation between the parties was dismissed and each party received a global release of those claims. Under the MBIA Settlement, all pending litigation between the parties was dismissed and each party received a global release of those claims. The Corporation made a settlement payment to MBIA of $1.565 billion in cash and transferred to MBIA approximately $95 million in fair market value of notes issued by MBIA and previously held by the Corporation. The Corporation was fully reserved at March 31, 2013 for the MBIA Settlement. In addition, MBIA issued to the Corporation warrants to purchase up to approximately 4.9 percent of MBIA's currently outstanding common stock, at an exercise price of $9.59 per share, which may be exercised at any time prior to May 2018. In addition, the Corporation provided a senior secured $500 million credit facility to an affiliate of MBIA. The parties also terminated various credit default swaps (CDS) transactions entered into between the Corporation and an MBIA-affiliate, LaCrosse Financial Products, LLC, and guaranteed by MBIA, which constituted all of the outstanding CDS protection agreements purchased by the Corporation from MBIA on commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS). Collectively, those CDS transactions had a notional value of $7.4 billion and a fair value of $813 million as of March 31, 2013. The parties also terminated certain other trades in order to close out positions between the parties; the termination of these trades did not have a material impact on the Corporation's financial statements. For additional information, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Representations and Warranties on page 58 and Note 8 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Performance Overview Net income was $4.0 billion , or $0.32 per diluted share and $5.5 billion , or $0.42 per diluted share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $2.5 billion , or $0.19 and $3.1 billion , or $0.22 for the same periods in 2012 . The results for the first half of 2013 reflect our efforts to stabilize revenue, decrease costs, strengthen the balance sheet and improve credit quality. The following highlights the most significant changes from the prior-year periods. Net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis increased $989 million to $10.8 billion , and $811 million to $21.6 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 . The increases in net interest income were primarily due to reductions in long-term debt balances, positive market-related premium amortization and hedge ineffectiveness on debt securities, improved trading-related net interest income, higher commercial loan balances and lower rates paid on deposits, partially offset by lower consumer loan balances as well as lower asset yields driven by the low rate environment. The net interest yield on a FTE basis increased 23 basis points (bps) and eight bps to 2.44 percent for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 due to the same factors described above. Noninterest income decreased $242 million to $12.2 billion , and increased $859 million to $24.7 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 . The significant drivers for the three-month period were lower mortgage banking income reflecting lower servicing income, partially offset by increases in investment banking income, equity investment income, and investment and brokerage services income. The year-ago period included gains of $505 million related to liability management actions. 8 Table of Contents The significant drivers of noninterest income for the six-month period were negative fair value adjustments on structured liabilities of $80 million compared to $3.4 billion , debit valuation adjustment (DVA) losses on derivatives, net of hedges, of $15 million compared to $1.6 billion and increases in investment banking income and investment and brokerage services income. These improvements were partially offset by lower mortgage banking income and lower gains on sales of debt securities. The year-ago period included gains of $1.7 billion related to liability management actions. The provision for credit losses decreased $562 million to $1.2 billion , and $1.3 billion to $2.9 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 . The improvement was primarily in the home loans portfolio, due to improved portfolio trends as well as the impact of increased home prices. Noninterest expense decreased $1.0 billion to $16.0 billion , and $671 million to $35.5 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 . The decrease for the three-month period was driven by a $604 million decrease in other general operating expense primarily due to lower litigation expense as well as a decrease in professional fees due in part to reduced Legacy Assets & Servicing expenses, and a decrease in personnel expense as we continue to streamline processes and achieve cost savings. The decrease for the six-month period was driven by the same factors described in the three-month discussion above, partially offset by higher litigation expense due in part to the MBIA Settlement. Income tax expense was $1.5 billion on $5.5 billion of pre-tax income and $2.0 billion on $7.5 billion of pre-tax income, resulting in effective tax rates of 27.0 percent and 26.6 percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 . This was compared to $684 million on $3.1 billion of pre-tax income and $750 million on $3.9 billion of pre-tax income that resulted in effective tax rates of 21.7 percent and 19.4 percent for the same periods in 2012 . For additional summary information on the Corporation's results, see Financial Highlights on page 10 .

The following highlights the significant changes. Card income decreased $109 million and $156 million primarily driven by decreased revenue due to the exit of consumer protection products. Investment and brokerage services increased $296 million and $447 million primarily driven by higher market levels, impact of long-term assets under management (AUM) flows and increased transactional activity. Investment banking income increased $410 million and $728 million due to strong debt underwriting performance, primarily within leveraged finance and investment grade, and equity underwriting performance due to significant increases in global initial public offering (IPO) markets, partially offset by a decline in advisory fees. Equity investment income increased $312 million and $110 million primarily due to a gain on the sale of an equity investment in the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 , partially offset by a gain on the sale of an investment in Global Markets in the same periods in 2012 . Trading account profits increased $174 million and $1.1 billion . Net DVA gains on derivatives were $39 million and net DVA losses were $15 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to net DVA losses of $158 million and $1.6 billion in the year-ago periods. Excluding net DVA, trading account profits decreased $23 million and $514 million primarily due to decreases in our fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) businesses reflecting less favorable market conditions, related to the Federal Reserve's policy announcement in June, primarily in structured credit and interest rate products. Mortgage banking income decreased $481 million and $830 million primarily driven by a decrease in servicing income due to a smaller servicing portfolio and the divestiture of certain servicing business units in the prior year. The decline in the servicing portfolio was due primarily to mortgage servicing rights (MSR) sales in 2013. 10 Table of Contents Other income (loss) decreased $806 million to a loss of $76 million for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 and improved $276 million to a loss of $188 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013. Fair value adjustments on structured liabilities were positive $10 million and negative $80 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to negative fair value adjustments of $62 million and $3.4 billion in the year-ago periods. The six months ended June 30, 2013 included a $450 million write-down of a receivable. The prior-year periods included gains related to liability management actions of $505 million and $1.7 billion . Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses decreased $562 million to $1.2 billion , and $1.3 billion to $2.9 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012 . For the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 , the provision for credit losses was $900 million and $1.7 billion lower than net charge-offs, resulting in a reduction in the allowance for credit losses due to continued improvement in the home loans portfolio primarily as a result of increased home prices and improvement in credit card portfolios. If the pace of improvement in the economy continues, we anticipate additional reductions in the allowance for credit losses, particularly in our consumer real estate portfolios. Net charge-offs totaled $2.1 billion , or 0.94 percent , and $4.6 billion , or 1.04 percent of average loans and leases for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $3.6 billion , or 1.64 percent , and $7.7 billion , or 1.72 percent for the same periods in 2012 . The decrease in net charge-offs was driven by credit quality improvement across all portfolios. Given the improving trend in delinquencies and other credit quality metrics, we expect net charge-offs to be below $2.0 billion for the three months ending September 30, 2013. For more information on the provision for credit losses, see Provision for Credit Losses on page 120 . Noninterest Expense Table 4 Noninterest Expense Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 (Dollars in millions) 2013 2012 2013 2012 Personnel $ 8,531 $ 8,729 $ 18,422 $ 18,917 Occupancy 1,109 1,117 2,263 2,259 Equipment 532 546 1,082 1,157 Marketing 437 449 866 914 Professional fees 694 922 1,343 1,705 Amortization of intangibles 274 321 550 640 Data processing 779 692 1,591 1,548 Telecommunications 411 417 820 817 Other general operating 3,251 3,855 8,581 8,232 Total noninterest expense $ 16,018 $ 17,048 $ 35,518 $ 36,189 Noninterest expense decreased $1.0 billion to $16.0 billion , and $671 million to $35.5 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to same periods in 2012 . The decrease for the three months ended June 30, 2013 was driven by a $604 million decrease in other general operating expense primarily due to lower litigation expense, a $228 million decrease in professional fees due in part to reduced default management activities in Legacy Assets & Servicing, and a $198 million decrease in personnel expense as we continue to streamline processes and achieve cost savings. The decrease for the six months ended June 30, 2013 was driven by a $495 million decrease in personnel expense and a $362 million decrease in professional fees as a result of the same factors described in the three-month discussion above, partially offset by a $349 million increase in other general operating expense. The increase in other general operating expense was the result of higher litigation expense due in part to the MBIA Settlement. In connection with Project New BAC, which was first announced in the third quarter of 2011, we continue to achieve cost savings in certain noninterest expense categories as we further streamline workflows, simplify processes and align expenses with our overall strategic plan and operating principles. We expect total cost savings from Project New BAC to reach $8 billion per year on an annualized basis, or $2 billion per quarter, by mid-2015 . We expect to achieve approximately $1.5 billion in quarterly cost savings by the fourth quarter of 2013, representing 75 percent of the quarterly target. 11 Table of Contents Income Tax Expense Income tax expense was $1.5 billion on $5.5 billion of pre-tax income and $2.0 billion on $7.5 billion of pre-tax income, resulting in effective tax rates of 27.0 percent and 26.6 percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 . This was compared to $684 million on $3.1 billion of pre-tax income and $750 million on $3.9 billion of pre-tax income that resulted in effective tax rates of 21.7 percent and 19.4 percent for the same periods in 2012 . The effective tax rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 were primarily driven by our recurring tax preference items and an increase in tax benefits from the 2012 non-U.S. restructurings as compared to amounts previously recognized. The effective tax rates in the year-ago periods were primarily driven by our recurring tax preference items and discrete tax benefits. On July 17, 2013, the U.K. 2013 Finance Bill was enacted, which reduced the U.K. corporate income tax rate by three percent to 20 percent . Two percent of the reduction will become effective on April 1, 2014 and the additional one percent reduction on April 1, 2015. These reductions will favorably affect income tax expense on future U.K. earnings but also require us to remeasure, in the period of enactment, our U.K. net deferred tax assets using the lower tax rates. As a result, in the three months ending September 30, 2013, we will record a charge to income tax expense of approximately $1.1 billion in aggregate for these reductions. Because our deferred tax assets in excess of a certain amount are disallowed in calculating regulatory capital, this charge will not impact our capital ratios.

These portfolios are designed to ensure the adequacy of capital while enhancing our ability to manage liquidity requirements for the Corporation and our customers, and to position the balance sheet in accordance with the Corporation's risk appetite. The execution of these activities requires the use of balance sheet and capital-related limits including spot, average and risk-weighted asset limits, particularly within the market-making activities of our trading businesses. One of our key regulatory metrics, Tier 1 leverage ratio, is calculated based on adjusted quarterly average total assets. 12 Table of Contents Assets At June 30, 2013 , total assets were approximately $2.1 trillion , a decrease of $86.7 billion , or four percent , from December 31, 2012 . This decrease was driven by lower trading account assets due to a reduction in U.S. government and agency securities, lower debt securities driven by net sales of U.S. Treasuries, paydowns and decreases in the fair value of available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities resulting from the impact of higher interest rates, a decrease in consumer loan balances driven by continued run-off in certain portfolios as well as paydowns and charge-offs outpacing originations, and lower cash and cash equivalent balances. These decreases were partially offset by higher commercial loan balances. Average total assets decreased $10.0 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 primarily driven by lower debt securities due to net sales of U.S. Treasuries, paydowns and decreases in fair value of AFS debt securities, a decrease in consumer loan balances driven by continued run-off in certain portfolios as well as paydowns and charge-offs outpacing originations, lower cash and cash equivalent balances, and lower derivative dealer assets largely due to MSR sales resulting in a decrease in derivative contracts used to hedge certain market risks on MSRs. These declines were partially offset by higher commercial loan balances and higher trading account assets primarily due to increased securities inventory and client-based activity. Average total assets increased $7.6 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 primarily driven by higher commercial loan balances and higher trading account assets resulting from increased securities inventory and client-based activity. These increases were partially offset by lower consumer loan balances driven by continued run-off in certain portfolios as well as paydowns and charge-offs outpacing originations, lower cash and cash equivalent balances, and a decrease in derivative dealer assets. Liabilities and Shareholders' Equity At June 30, 2013 , total liabilities were approximately $1.9 trillion , a decrease of $80.7 billion , or four percent , from December 31, 2012 . This decrease was driven by lower securities sold under agreement to repurchase due to lower matched-book activity and trading inventory, lower deposits and reductions in long-term debt. These decreases were partially offset by higher short-term borrowings due to an increase in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB). Average total liabilities decreased $9.5 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 primarily driven by reductions in long-term debt, partially offset by growth in deposits and higher trading account liabilities. Average total liabilities increased $5.6 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 primarily driven by growth in deposits, higher securities loaned or sold under agreement to repurchase due to funding of trading inventory and higher trading account liabilities, partially offset by reductions in long-term debt. At June 30, 2013 , shareholders' equity was $231.0 billion , a decrease of $5.9 billion from December 31, 2012 driven by a decrease in the fair value of AFS debt securities resulting from the impact of higher interest rates, which is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI), redemptions of preferred stock and common stock repurchases, partially offset by earnings and issuances of preferred stock. Average shareholders' equity decreased $495 million for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 driven by redemptions of preferred stock, a decrease in the fair value of AFS debt securities and common stock repurchases. These decreases were partially offset by earnings, common stock issued under employee benefit plans and issuances of preferred stock. Average shareholders' equity increased $2.0 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 driven by earnings, common stock issued under employee benefit plans and issuances of preferred stock. These increases were partially offset by redemptions of preferred stock, a decrease in the fair value of AFS debt securities and common stock repurchases. 13 Table of Contents Table 6 Selected Quarterly Financial Data 2013 Quarters 2012 Quarters (In millions, except per share information) Second First Fourth Third Second Income statement Net interest income $ 10,549 $ 10,664 $ 10,324 $ 9,938 $ 9,548 Noninterest income 12,178 12,533 8,336 10,490 12,420 Total revenue, net of interest expense 22,727 23,197 18,660 20,428 21,968 Provision for credit losses 1,211 1,713 2,204 1,774 1,773 Noninterest expense 16,018 19,500 18,360 17,544 17,048 Income (loss) before income taxes 5,498 1,984 (1,904 ) 1,110 3,147 Income tax expense (benefit) 1,486 501 (2,636 ) 770 684 Net income 4,012 1,483 732 340 2,463 Net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders 3,571 1,110 367 (33 ) 2,098 Average common shares issued and outstanding 10,776 10,799 10,777 10,776 10,776 Average diluted common shares issued and outstanding (1) 11,525 11,155 10,885 10,776 11,556 Performance ratios Return on average assets 0.74 % 0.27 % 0.13 % 0.06 % 0.45 % Four quarter trailing return on average assets (2) 0.30 0.23 0.19 0.25 0.51 Return on average common shareholders' equity 6.55 2.06 0.67 n/m 3.89 Return on average tangible common shareholders' equity (3) 9.88 3.12 1.01 n/m 5.95 Return on average tangible shareholders' equity (3) 9.98 3.69 1.77 0.84 6.16 Total ending equity to total ending assets 10.88 10.91 10.72 11.02 10.92 Total average equity to total average assets 10.76 10.71 10.79 10.86 10.73 Dividend payout 3.01 9.75 29.33 n/m 5.60 Per common share data Earnings $ 0.33 $ 0.10 $ 0.03 $ 0.00 $ 0.19 Diluted earnings (1) 0.32 0.10 0.03 0.00 0.19 Dividends paid 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 Book value 20.18 20.19 20.24 20.40 20.16 Tangible book value (3) 13.32 13.36 13.36 13.48 13.22 Market price per share of common stock Closing $ 12.86 $ 12.18 $ 11.61 $ 8.83 $ 8.18 High closing 13.83 12.78 11.61 9.55 9.68 Low closing 11.44 11.03 8.93 7.04 6.83 Market capitalization $ 138,156 $ 131,817 $ 125,136 $ 95,163 $ 88,155 (1) Due to a net loss applicable to common shareholders for the third quarter of 2012, the impact of antidilutive equity instruments was excluded from diluted earnings per share and average diluted common shares.

We believe managing the business with net interest income on a FTE basis provides a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. Certain performance measures including the efficiency ratio and net interest yield utilize net interest income (and thus total revenue) on a FTE basis. The efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue, and net interest yield measures the bps we earn over the cost of funds. We also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents an adjusted shareholders' equity or common shareholders' equity amount which has been reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models all use return on average tangible shareholders' equity (ROTE) as key measures to support our overall growth goals. These ratios are as follows: Return on average tangible common shareholders' equity measures our earnings contribution as a percentage of adjusted common shareholders' equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders' equity divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTE measures our earnings contribution as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders' equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders' equity divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders' equity divided by ending common shares outstanding. The aforementioned supplemental data and performance measures are presented in Tables 6 and 7 . We evaluate our business segment results based on measures that utilize return on average allocated capital, and prior to January 1, 2013, the return on average economic capital, both of which represent non-GAAP financial measures. These ratios are calculated as net income adjusted for cost of funds and earnings credits and certain expenses related to intangibles, divided by average allocated capital or average economic capital, as applicable. In addition, for purposes of goodwill impairment testing, the Corporation utilizes allocated equity as a proxy for the carrying value of its reporting units. Allocated equity for the business segments is comprised of allocated capital (or economic capital prior to 2013) plus capital for the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the business segment. For additional information, see Business Segment Operations on page 30 and Note 9 Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Tables 8 , 9 and 10 provide reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures. We believe the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides additional clarity in assessing the results of the Corporation and our segments. Other companies may define or calculate these measures and ratios differently.

(2) Represents a non-GAAP financial measure. (3) Calculated on an annualized basis. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 , net interest income excluding trading-related net interest income increased $723 million to $9.9 billion , and $331 million to $19.7 billion compared to the same periods in 2012 . The increases were primarily due to reductions in long-term debt balances , positive market-related premium amortization and hedge ineffectiveness on debt securities, higher commercial loan balances and lower rates paid on deposits, partially offset by lower consumer loan balances as well as lower asset yields driven by the low rate environment. For more information on the impacts of rising interest rates, see Interest Rate Risk Management for Nontrading Activities on page 130 . Average earning assets excluding trading-related earning assets for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 decreased $46.0 billion to $1,282.0 billion , and $43.4 billion to $1,292.5 billion compared to the same periods in 2012 . The decreases were primarily due to declines in consumer loans and time deposits placed, partially offset by increases in commercial loans. In addition, for the three months ended June 30, 2013 , the decrease was also driven by lower investment securities balances. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 , net interest yield on earning assets excluding trading-related activities increased 32 bps to 3.08 percent , and 15 bps to 3.06 percent compared to the same periods in 2012 due to the same factors described above. 23 Table of Contents Table 12 Quarterly Average Balances and Interest Rates FTE Basis Second Quarter 2013 First Quarter 2013 (Dollars in millions) Average Balance Interest Income/ Expense Yield/ Rate Average Balance Interest Income/ Expense Yield/ Rate Earning assets Time deposits placed and other short-term investments (1) $ 15,088 $ 46 1.21 % $ 16,129 $ 46 1.17 % Federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell 233,394 319 0.55 237,463 315 0.54 Trading account assets 181,620 1,224 2.70 194,364 1,380 2.87 Debt securities (2) 343,260 2,557 2.98 356,399 2,556 2.87 Loans and leases (3) : Residential mortgage (4) 257,275 2,246 3.49 258,630 2,340 3.62 Home equity 101,708 951 3.74 105,939 997 3.80 U.S. credit card 89,722 2,192 9.80 91,712 2,249 9.95 Non-U.S. credit card 10,613 315 11.93 11,027 329 12.10 Direct/Indirect consumer (5) 82,485 598 2.90 82,364 620 3.06 Other consumer (6) 1,756 17 4.17 1,666 19 4.36 Total consumer 543,559 6,319 4.66 551,338 6,554 4.79 U.S. commercial 217,464 1,741 3.21 210,706 1,666 3.20 Commercial real estate (7) 40,612 340 3.36 39,179 326 3.38 Commercial lease financing 23,579 205 3.48 23,534 236 4.01 Non-U.S. commercial 89,020 543 2.45 81,502 467 2.32 Total commercial 370,675 2,829 3.06 354,921 2,695 3.07 Total loans and leases 914,234 9,148 4.01 906,259 9,249 4.12 Other earning assets 81,740 713 3.50 90,172 733 3.29 Total earning assets (8) 1,769,336 14,007 3.17 1,800,786 14,279 3.20 Cash and cash equivalents (1) 104,486 40 92,846 33 Other assets, less allowance for loan and lease losses 310,788 318,798 Total assets $ 2,184,610 $ 2,212,430 (1) For this presentation, fees earned on overnight deposits placed with the Federal Reserve are included in the cash and cash equivalents line, consistent with the Consolidated Balance Sheet presentation of these deposits. In addition, beginning in the third quarter of 2012, fees earned on deposits, primarily overnight, placed with certain non-U.S. central banks, which are included in the time deposits placed and other short-term investments line in prior periods, have been included in the cash and cash equivalents line. Net interest income and net interest yield are calculated excluding these fees. (2) Yields on debt securities carried at fair value are calculated based on fair value rather than the cost basis. The use of fair value does not have a material impact on net interest yield. (3) Nonperforming loans are included in the respective average loan balances.

For more information on this measure and for a corresponding reconciliation to a GAAP financial measure, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 18 . The management accounting and reporting process derives segment and business results by utilizing allocation methodologies for revenue and expense. The net income derived for the businesses is dependent upon revenue and cost allocations using an activity-based costing model, funds transfer pricing, and other methodologies and assumptions management believes are appropriate to reflect the results of the business. Total revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest income on a FTE basis and noninterest income. The adjustment of net interest income to a FTE basis results in a corresponding increase in income tax expense. The segment results also reflect certain revenue and expense methodologies that are utilized to determine net income. The net interest income of the businesses includes the results of a funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics. For presentation purposes, in segments where the total of liabilities and equity exceeds assets, which are generally deposit-taking segments, we allocate assets to match liabilities. Net interest income of the business segments also includes an allocation of net interest income generated by certain of our asset and liability management (ALM) activities. 30 Table of Contents Our ALM activities include an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of various derivatives and cash instruments to manage fluctuations in earnings and capital that are caused by interest rate volatility. Our goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital. The results of a majority of our ALM activities are allocated to the business segments and fluctuate based on the performance of the ALM activities. ALM activities include external product pricing decisions including deposit pricing strategies, the effects of our internal funds transfer pricing process and the net effects of other ALM activities. Certain expenses not directly attributable to a specific business segment are allocated to the segments. The most significant of these expenses include data and item processing costs and certain centralized or shared functions. Data processing costs are allocated to the segments based on equipment usage. Item processing costs are allocated to the segments based on the volume of items processed for each segment. The costs of certain other centralized or shared functions are allocated based on methodologies that reflect utilization. Effective January 1, 2013, on a prospective basis, we adjusted the amount of capital being allocated to our business segments. The adjustment reflects a refinement to the prior-year methodology (economic capital) which focused solely on internal risk-based economic capital models. The refined methodology (allocated capital) now also considers the effect of regulatory capital requirements in addition to internal risk-based economic capital models. The Corporation's internal risk-based capital models use a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment's credit, market, interest rate, business and operational risk components. See Managing Risk on page 68 and Strategic Risk Management on page 69 for more information on the nature of these risks. The capital allocated to the business segments is currently referred to as allocated capital and, prior to January 1, 2013, was referred to as economic capital, both of which represent non-GAAP financial measures. Allocated capital in the business segments is subject to change over time. For purposes of goodwill impairment testing, the Corporation utilizes allocated equity as a proxy for the carrying value of its reporting units. For additional information, see Note 9 Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements . For more information on the business segments and reconciliations to consolidated total revenue, net income (loss) and period-end total assets, see Note 20 Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements . 31 Table of Contents Consumer & Business Banking Three Months Ended June 30 Deposits Consumer Lending Total Consumer & Business Banking (Dollars in millions) 2013 2012 2013 2012 2013 2012 % Change Net interest income (FTE basis) $ 2,472 $ 2,216 $ 2,562 $ 2,662 $ 5,034 $ 4,878 3 % Noninterest income: Card income 15 19 1,171 1,326 1,186 1,345 (12 ) Service charges 1,035 1,081 1,035 1,081 (4 ) All other income 117 97 62 94 179 191 (6 ) Total noninterest income 1,167 1,197 1,233 1,420 2,400 2,617 (8 ) Total revenue, net of interest expense (FTE basis) 3,639 3,413 3,795 4,082 7,434 7,495 (1 ) Provision for credit losses 35 191 932 966 967 1,157 (16 ) Noninterest expense 2,812 2,865 1,371 1,555 4,183 4,420 (5 ) Income before income taxes 792 357 1,492 1,561 2,284 1,918 19 Income tax expense (FTE basis) 308 132 584 578 892 710 26 Net income $ 484 $ 225 $ 908 $ 983 $ 1,392 $ 1,208 15 Net interest yield (FTE basis) 1.88 % 1.87 % 7.26 % 7.09 % 3.72 % 4.00 % Return on average allocated capital (1) 12.62 24.98 18.64 Return on average economic capital (1) 7.06 36.15 20.46 Efficiency ratio (FTE basis) 77.24 83.91 36.14 38.14 56.26 58.98 Balance Sheet Average Total loans and leases $ 22,434 $ 23,609 $ 141,159 $ 149,956 $ 163,593 $ 173,565 (6 ) Total earning assets (2) 526,322 475,573 141,599 151,031 542,697 490,845 11 Total assets (2) 559,119 509,052 150,248 158,702 584,143 531,995 10 Total deposits 521,784 473,992 n/m n/m 522,259 474,328 10 Allocated capital (1) 15,400 14,600 30,000 n/m Economic capital (1) 12,837 10,970 23,807 n/m (1) Effective January 1, 2013, we revised, on a prospective basis, the methodology for allocating capital to the business segments .

CBB, which is comprised of Deposits and Consumer Lending, offers a diversified range of credit, banking and investment products and services to consumers and businesses. Our customers and clients have access to a franchise network that stretches coast to coast through 32 states and the District of Columbia. The franchise network includes approximately 5,300 banking centers, 16,350 ATMs, nationwide call centers, and online and mobile platforms. During the first quarter of 2013, Business Banking results were moved into Deposits as we continue to integrate these businesses. During the second quarter of 2013, consumer Dealer Financial Services results were moved into CBB from Global Banking to align this business more closely with our consumer lending activity and better serve the needs of our customers. As a result, Card Services was renamed Consumer Lending. Prior periods were reclassified to conform to current period presentation. 33 Table of Contents CBB Results Three Months Ended June 30, 2013 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2012 Net income for CBB increased $184 million to $1.4 billion primarily due to lower noninterest expense and provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower revenue. Net interest income increased $156 million to $5.0 billion reflecting higher ALM activities and growth in deposit balances, partially offset by compressed deposit spreads due to the continued low rate environment and the impact of lower average loan balances primarily in Consumer Lending. Noninterest income decreased $217 million to $2.4 billion driven by lower card income primarily from the exit of consumer protection products and the allocation of certain card revenue to GWIM for its clients with a credit card, lower deposit service charges, and the net impact of portfolio sales. The provision for credit losses decreased $190 million to $967 million largely due to improvements in credit quality in the small business portfolio within Deposits. Noninterest expense decreased $237 million to $4.2 billion primarily due to lower litigation and operating expenses. Six Months Ended June 30, 2013 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2012 Net income for CBB increased $91 million to $2.8 billion primarily driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above. Net interest income decreased $113 million to $10.0 billion reflecting compressed deposit spreads due to the continued low rate environment and the impact of lower average loan balances primarily in Consumer Lending, partially offset by higher ALM activities and growth in deposit balances. Noninterest income decreased $169 million to $4.8 billion driven by lower card income primarily from the allocation of certain card revenue to GWIM for its clients with a credit card, lower deposit service charges and the net impact of portfolio sales. The provision for credit losses decreased $145 million to $1.9 billion and noninterest expense decreased $372 million to $8.4 billion driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above. Deposits Deposits includes the results of consumer deposit activities which consist of a comprehensive range of products provided to consumers and small businesses. Our deposit products include traditional savings accounts, money market savings accounts, CDs and IRAs, noninterest- and interest-bearing checking accounts, as well as investment accounts and products. The revenue is allocated to the deposit products using our funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics. Deposits generates fees such as account service fees, non-sufficient funds fees, overdraft charges and ATM fees, as well as investment and brokerage fees from Merrill Edge accounts. Merrill Edge is an integrated investing and banking service targeted at customers with less than $250,000 in investable assets. Merrill Edge provides investment advice and guidance, brokerage services, a self-directed online investing platform and key banking capabilities including access to the Corporation's network of banking centers and ATMs. Deposits also provides a wide range of lending-related products and services, integrated working capital management and treasury solutions to clients through our network of offices and client relationship teams along with various product partners.

Deposits includes the net impact of migrating customers and their related deposit balances between Deposits and GWIM as well as other client-managed businesses. For more information on the migration of customer balances to or from GWIM , see GWIM on page 52 . Three Months Ended June 30, 2013 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2012 Net income for Deposits increased $259 million to $484 million primarily due to higher revenue, and lower provision for credit losses and noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $256 million to $2.5 billion reflecting higher ALM activities, growth in deposit balances, a customer shift to higher spread liquid products and continued pricing discipline, partially offset by compressed deposit spreads due to the continued low rate environment. Noninterest income decreased $30 million to $1.2 billion primarily due to lower deposit service charges. The provision for credit losses decreased $156 million to $35 million due to improvements in credit quality in the small business portfolio. Noninterest expense decreased $53 million to $2.8 billion primarily due to lower operating expense. 34 Table of Contents Average loans decreased $1.2 billion to $22.4 billion primarily driven by loan prepayments and continued run-off of non-core portfolios. Average deposits increased $47.8 billion to $521.8 billion driven by a customer shift to more liquid products in the low rate environment. Additionally, $17.6 billion of the increase in average deposits was due to net transfers of deposits from other businesses, largely GWIM . Growth in checking, traditional savings and money market savings of $52.3 billion was partially offset by a decline in time deposits of $4.5 billion. As a result of our continued pricing discipline and the shift in the mix of deposits, the rate paid on average deposits declined by seven bps to twelve bps . Six Months Ended June 30, 2013 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2012 Net income for Deposits increased $245 million to $882 million driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above. Net interest income increased $190 million to $4.9 billion , noninterest income decreased $60 million to $2.3 billion and the provision for credit losses decreased $180 million to $98 million . These changes were driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion. Noninterest expense decreased $106 million to $5.6 billion as lower operating expense was partially offset by higher litigation expense. Average loans decreased $1.3 billion to $22.5 billion and average deposits increased $43.1 billion to $512.0 billion driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above. Of the increase in average deposits, $12.2 billion was due to net transfers of deposits from other businesses, largely GWIM .

The number of banking centers declined by 266 and ATMs increased by 134 as we continue to optimize our consumer banking network and improve our cost-to-serve. Consumer Lending Consumer Lending is one of the leading issuers of credit and debit cards to consumers and small businesses in the U.S. Our lending products and services also include direct and indirect consumer loans such as automotive, marine, aircraft, recreational vehicle loans and consumer personal loans. In addition to earning net interest spread revenue on its lending activities, Consumer Lending generates interchange revenue from credit and debit card transactions as well as annual credit card fees and other miscellaneous fees. On July 31, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued a ruling regarding the Federal Reserve's rules implementing the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act's (Financial Reform Act) Durbin Amendment. The ruling requires the Federal Reserve to reconsider the current $0.21 per transaction cap on debit card interchange fees. If the Federal Reserve implements a lower per transaction cap, it may have a significant adverse impact on our debit card interchange fee revenue in future periods. We cannot predict the actions that the Federal Reserve may take, or the timing thereof, in response to the ruling. Three Months Ended June 30, 2013 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2012 Net income for Consumer Lending decreased $75 million to $908 million primarily driven by a decrease in revenue, partially offset by lower noninterest expense and a decrease in the provision for credit losses. Net interest income decreased $100 million to $2.6 billion driven by the impact of lower average loan balances. The net interest yield increased 17 bps to 7.26 percent primarily due to lower funding costs. Noninterest income decreased $187 million to $1.2 billion driven by lower card income primarily from the exit of consumer protection products and the allocation of certain card revenue to GWIM for its clients with a credit card, and the net impact of portfolio sales. 35 Table of Contents The provision for credit losses decreased $34 million to $932 million due to improvements in credit quality. Noninterest expense decreased $184 million to $1.4 billion primarily due to lower litigation and operating expenses. Average loans decreased $8.8 billion to $141.2 billion primarily driven by charge-offs and continued run-off of non-core portfolios. Six Months Ended June 30, 2013 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2012 Net income for Consumer Lending decreased $154 million to $1.9 billion primarily driven by a decrease in revenue, partially offset by lower noninterest expense. Net interest income decreased $303 million to $5.2 billion while the net interest yield increased 22 bps to 7.33 percent . These changes were driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion. Noninterest income decreased $109 million to $2.5 billion driven by lower card income primarily from the allocation of certain card revenue to GWIM for its clients with a credit card and the net impact of portfolio sales. The provision for credit losses of $1.8 billion remained relatively unchanged. Noninterest expense decreased $266 million to $2.7 billion driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion. Average loans decreased $11.9 billion to $142.2 billion primarily driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion.

CRES operations include Home Loans and Legacy Assets & Servicing. Home Loans is responsible for ongoing loan production activities and the CRES home equity loan portfolio not selected for inclusion in the Legacy Assets & Servicing owned portfolio. Legacy Assets & Servicing is responsible for all of our mortgage servicing activities related to loans serviced for others and loans held by the Corporation, including loans that have been designated as the Legacy Assets & Servicing Portfolios. For more information on MSRs, see page 44 . The Legacy Assets & Servicing Portfolios (both owned and serviced), herein referred to as the Legacy Owned and Legacy Serviced Portfolios, respectively (together, the Legacy Portfolios), and as further defined below, include those loans that would not have been originated under our underwriting standards prior to January 1, 2011. For more information on our Legacy Portfolios , see page 40 . In addition, Legacy Assets & Servicing is responsible for managing legacy exposures related to CRES (e.g., representations and warranties). This alignment allows CRES management to lead the ongoing Home Loans business while also providing focus on legacy mortgage issues and servicing activities. CRES , primarily through Home Loans operations, generates revenue by providing an extensive line of consumer real estate products and services to customers nationwide. CRES products offered by Home Loans include fixed- and adjustable-rate first-lien mortgage loans for home purchase and refinancing needs, home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) and home equity loans. First mortgage products are generally either sold into the secondary mortgage market to investors, while we generally retain MSRs (which are on the balance sheet of Legacy Assets & Servicing) and the Bank of America customer relationships, or are held on the balance sheet in All Other for ALM purposes. Home Loans is compensated for loans held for ALM purposes on a management accounting basis with the corresponding offset in All Other . Newly originated HELOCs and home equity loans are retained on the CRES balance sheet in Home Loans. CRES includes the impact of migrating customers and their related loan balances between GWIM and CRES . For more information on the transfer of customer balances, see GWIM on page 52 . 38 Table of Contents CRES Results Three Months Ended June 30, 2013 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2012 The net loss for CRES increased $193 million to $937 million primarily driven by lower mortgage banking income and higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower noninterest expense. Mortgage banking income decrease d $409 million due to both lower servicing income and lower core production income, partially offset by lower representations and warranties provision. The decrease in servicing income was due to a decline in the size of our servicing portfolio driven by strategic sales of MSRs as well as loan prepayment activity. Loan prepayment activity exceeded new originations during the second quarter largely due to our exit from the correspondent lending channel in late 2011. The provision for credit losses increased $104 million reflecting a slower rate of credit quality improvement than the year-ago period. Noninterest expense decreased $130 million primarily due to lower expenses in Legacy Assets & Servicing, partially offset by higher loan production costs due to higher loan originations. Six Months Ended June 30, 2013 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2012 The net loss for CRES increased $1.2 billion to $3.1 billion primarily driven by higher noninterest expense and lower mortgage banking income, partially offset by lower provision for credit losses. Mortgage banking income decrease d $750 million driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above. The provision for credit losses decreased $68 million primarily driven by an improved home price outlook in the purchased credit-impaired (PCI) portfolio. Noninterest expense increased $1.4 billion primarily due to higher litigation expense driven in large part by the MBIA Settlement, partially offset by lower costs due to the divestiture of certain ancillary servicing business units in 2012 and lower default-related servicing expenses. Home Loans Home Loans products are available to our customers through our retail network of approximately 5,300 banking centers, mortgage loan officers in approximately 320 locations and a sales force offering our customers direct telephone and online access to our products. Three Months Ended June 30, 2013 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2012 Net income for Home Loans decreased $186 million to $47 million primarily driven by a decrease in noninterest income, higher provision for credit losses and an increase in noninterest expense. Noninterest income decrease d $135 million primarily due to lower mortgage banking income driven by a decline in core production revenue as a result of industry-wide margin compression. The provision for credit losses increased $99 million reflecting a slower rate of credit quality improvement than the year-ago period. Noninterest expense increased $72 million primarily due to higher production costs associated with higher origination volume. The higher production costs were primarily personnel related as we continued to add mortgage loan officers, primarily in banking centers, and other employees in sales and fulfillment areas in order to expand capacity and enhance customer service. Six Months Ended June 30, 2013 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2012 Net income for Home Loans decreased $254 million to $94 million primarily driven by a decrease in noninterest income, higher provision for credit losses and an increase in noninterest expense. Noninterest income decrease d $244 million , the provision for credit losses increased $137 million and noninterest expense increased $32 million . These changes were driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above. Legacy Assets & Servicing Legacy Assets & Servicing is responsible for all of our servicing activities related to the residential mortgage and home equity loan portfolios, including owned loans and loans serviced for others (collectively, the mortgage serviced portfolio). A portion of this portfolio has been designated as the Legacy Serviced Portfolio, which represents 34 percent and 41 percent of the total mortgage serviced portfolio, as measured by unpaid principal balance, at June 30, 2013 and 2012 . Legacy Assets & Servicing results reflect the net cost of legacy exposures that are included in the results of CRES , including representations and warranties provision, litigation costs, financial results of the CRES home equity portfolio selected as part of the Legacy Owned Portfolio, the financial results of the servicing operations and the results of MSR activities, including net hedge results. The financial results of the servicing operations reflect certain revenues and expenses on loans serviced for others, including owned loans serviced for Home Loans, GWIM and All Other . 39 Table of Contents Servicing activities include collecting cash for principal, interest and escrow payments from borrowers, and disbursing customer draws for lines of credit and accounting for and remitting principal and interest payments to investors and escrow payments to third parties along with responding to customer inquiries. Our home retention efforts, including single point of contact resources, are also part of our servicing activities, along with supervising foreclosures and property dispositions. In an effort to help our customers avoid foreclosure, Legacy Assets & Servicing evaluates various workout options prior to foreclosure sales which, combined with ongoing foreclosure delays in states where foreclosure requires a court order following a legal proceeding (judicial states), has resulted in elongated default timelines. Although we have resumed foreclosure proceedings in all states, there continues to be significant inventory levels in judicial states. For more information on our servicing activities, including the impact of foreclosure delays, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Other Mortgage-related Matters on page 61 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Three Months Ended June 30, 2013 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2012 The net loss for Legacy Assets & Servicing was relatively unchanged at $984 million primarily driven by a decrease in noninterest income, largely offset by a decline in noninterest expense. Noninterest income decrease d $265 million primarily due to lower servicing income driven by a decline in the servicing portfolio and the divestiture of certain ancillary servicing business units in 2012, partially offset by lower representations and warranties provision and higher revenues from the sale of loans that had returned to performing status. The provision for credit losses was relatively unchanged at $227 million . Noninterest expense decreased $202 million primarily due to a $255 million reduction in default-related servicing expenses and a $133 million decrease due to the divestiture of certain ancillary servicing business units in 2012. These decreases were partially offset by a $146 million increase in mortgage-related assessments, waivers and similar costs related to foreclosure delays and a $40 million increase in litigation expense. We expect that noninterest expense in Legacy Assets & Servicing, excluding litigation costs, will be below $2.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013. Six Months Ended June 30, 2013 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2012 The net loss for Legacy Assets & Servicing increased $961 million to $3.2 billion primarily driven by an increase in noninterest expense and a decrease in noninterest income, partially offset by a decrease in the provision for credit losses. Noninterest income decrease d $483 million due to the same factors described in the three-month discussion above. The provision for credit losses decrease d $205 million due to an improved home price outlook in the PCI home equity loan portfolio. Noninterest expense increase d $1.4 billion primarily due to a $1.8 billion increase in litigation expense driven in large part by the MBIA Settlement, partially offset by a $253 million decline in costs due to the divestiture of certain ancillary servicing business units in 2012, a reduction of $77 million in default-related servicing expenses and a $65 million decrease in mortgage-related assessments, waivers and similar costs related to foreclosure delays. Legacy Portfolios The Legacy Portfolios (both owned and serviced) include those loans that would not have been originated under our underwriting standards prior to January 1, 2011. The PCI portfolios as well as certain loans that met a pre-defined delinquency status or probability of default threshold as of January 1, 2011 are also included in the Legacy Portfolios. Since determining the pool of loans to be included in the Legacy Portfolios as of January 1, 2011, the criteria have not changed for these portfolios, but will continue to be evaluated over time. Legacy Owned Portfolio The Legacy Owned Portfolio includes those loans that met the criteria as described above and are on the balance sheet of the Corporation. The home equity loan portfolio is held on the balance sheet of Legacy Assets & Servicing; whereas, the residential mortgage loan portfolio is held on the balance sheet of All Other . The financial results of the on-balance sheet loans are reported in the segment that owns the loans or in All Other . Total loans in the Legacy Owned Portfolio decrease d $5.7 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2013 to $125.4 billion , of which $42.4 billion was reflected on the Legacy Assets & Servicing balance sheet and the remainder was held on the balance sheet of All Other . The decrease was primarily related to payoffs, paydowns, charge-offs and PCI write-offs, largely offset by the addition of loans repurchased in connection with the Fannie Mae (FNMA) Settlement. For more information on the loans repurchased in connection with the FNMA Settlement, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 83 . 40 Table of Contents Legacy Serviced Portfolio The Legacy Serviced Portfolio includes the Legacy Owned Portfolio and those loans serviced for outside investors that met the criteria as described above. The table below summarizes the balances of the residential mortgage loans included in the Legacy Serviced Portfolio (the Legacy Residential Mortgage Serviced Portfolio) representing 33 percent and 40 percent of the total residential mortgage serviced portfolio, as measured by unpaid principal balance, of $887 billion and $1.5 trillion at June 30, 2013 and 2012 . The decline in the Legacy Residential Mortgage Serviced Portfolio was primarily related to servicing transfers, paydowns and payoffs. We expect that by the end of the fourth quarter of 2013, the number of 60 days or more past due residential mortgage loans in the Legacy and Non-Legacy Residential Mortgage Serviced Portfolios will decline below 375,000 from 492,000 at June 30, 2013 .

Non-Legacy Portfolio As previously discussed, Legacy Assets & Servicing is responsible for all of our servicing activities. The table below summarizes the balances of the residential mortgage loans that are not included in the Legacy Serviced Portfolio (the Non-Legacy Residential Mortgage Serviced Portfolio) representing 67 percent and 60 percent of the total residential mortgage serviced portfolio, as measured by unpaid principal balance, at June 30, 2013 and 2012 . The decline in the Non-Legacy Residential Mortgage Serviced Portfolio was primarily related to servicing transfers, paydowns and payoffs.

Core production income is comprised primarily of revenue from the fair value gains and losses recognized on our interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and loans held-for-sale (LHFS), the related secondary market execution, costs related to representations and warranties in the sales transactions along with other obligations incurred in the sales of mortgage loans and revenues earned in production-related ancillary businesses. Ongoing costs related to representations and warranties and other obligations that were incurred in the sales of mortgage loans in prior periods are also included in production income. Servicing income includes income earned in connection with servicing activities and MSR valuation adjustments, net of results from risk management activities used to hedge certain market risks of the MSRs. The costs associated with our servicing activities are included in noninterest expense. The table below summarizes the components of mortgage banking income. Mortgage Banking Income Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 (Dollars in millions) 2013 2012 2013 2012 Production income: Core production revenue $ 860 $ 902 $ 1,675 $ 1,830 Representations and warranties provision (197 ) (395 ) (447 ) (677 ) Total production income 663 507 1,228 1,153 Servicing income: Servicing fees 785 1,205 1,698 2,534 Impact of customer payments (1) (260 ) (282 ) (574 ) (803 ) Fair value changes of MSRs, net of risk management activities used to hedge certain market risks (2) 215 194 527 388 Other servicing-related revenue 8 196 19 376 Total net servicing income 748 1,313 1,670 2,495 Total CRES mortgage banking income 1,411 1,820 2,898 3,648 Eliminations (3) (233 ) (161 ) (457 ) (377 ) Total consolidated mortgage banking income $ 1,178 $ 1,659 $ 2,441 $ 3,271 (1) Represents the change in the value of the MSR asset due to the impact of customer payments received during the period. (2) Includes gains (losses) on sales of MSRs. (3) Includes the effect of transfers of mortgage loans from CRES to the ALM portfolio in All Other . Three Months Ended June 30, 2013 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2012 CRES first mortgage loan originations increased $6.3 billion , or 44 percent , reflecting an increase in our estimated retail market share combined with a higher market demand for both purchase and refinance transactions. Our increase in market share was due to expanded fulfillment capacity which allowed us to reduce the outstanding pipeline of applications and improve our competitive pricing position. Core production revenue decrease d $42 million as higher origination volumes were more than offset by lower margins primarily due to industry-wide margin compression. This decline was partially offset by higher revenue from sales of loans that had returned to performing status. During the three months ended June 30, 2013 , 83 percent of our first mortgage production volume was for refinance originations and 17 percent was for purchase originations compared to 81 percent and 19 percent for the same period in 2012 . Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP) refinance originations were 20 percent of all refinance originations, down from 31 percent for the same period in 2012 primarily due to the sales of MSRs. Making Home Affordable non-HARP refinance originations were 25 percent of all refinance originations as compared to 19 percent for the same period in 2012 . The remaining 55 percent of refinance originations were conventional refinances as compared to 50 percent for the same period in 2012 . The representations and warranties provision decreased $198 million as the year-ago period included provision related to non-government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) exposures based on activity with certain counterparties. 42 Table of Contents Net servicing income decreased $565 million driven by lower servicing fees due to a smaller servicing portfolio and lower ancillary income due to the divestiture of certain servicing business units in 2012. The decline in the size of our servicing portfolio was driven by strategic sales of MSRs as well as loan prepayment activity, which exceeded new originations primarily due to our exit from the correspondent lending channel in late 2011. For more information on sales of MSRs, see Mortgage Servicing Rights Sales of Mortgage Servicing Rights on page 44 . Six Months Ended June 30, 2013 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2012 CRES first mortgage loan originations increased $13.4 billion , or 51 percent , while core production revenue decrease d $155 million due to the same factors noted in the three-month discussion. During the six months ended June 30, 2013 , 87 percent of our first mortgage production volume was for refinance originations and 13 percent was for purchase originations compared to 82 percent and 18 percent for the same period in 2012 . HARP refinance originations were 23 percent of all refinance originations compared to 24 percent for the same period in 2012 . Making Home Affordable non-HARP refinance originations were 23 percent of all refinance originations as compared to 16 percent for the same period in 2012 . The remaining 54 percent of refinance originations related to conventional refinances as compared to 60 percent for the same period in 2012 . The representations and warranties provision was $230 million lower due to the same factors as described in the three-month discussion. Net servicing income decreased $825 million driven by lower servicing fees and ancillary income due to the same factors noted in the three-month discussion above. These declines were partially offset by a $229 million reduction in the impact of customer payments driven by a lower MSR asset combined with more favorable MSR results, net of hedges. Key Statistics Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 (Dollars in millions, except as noted) 2013 2012 2013 2012 Loan production Total Corporation (1) : First mortgage $ 25,276 $ 18,005 $ 49,196 $ 33,243 Home equity 1,496 930 2,612 1,690 CRES: First mortgage $ 20,509 $ 14,206 $ 39,778 $ 26,391 Home equity 1,283 724 2,225 1,321 Period end June 30 2013 December 31 2012 Mortgage serviced portfolio (in billions) (2, 3) $ 986 $ 1,332 Mortgage loans serviced for investors (in billions) 759 1,045 Mortgage servicing rights: Balance 5,827 5,716 Capitalized mortgage servicing rights (% of loans serviced for investors) 77 bps 55 bps (1) In addition to loan production in CRES , the remaining first mortgage and home equity loan production is primarily in GWIM . (2) Servicing of residential mortgage loans, HELOCs and home equity loans. (3) Excludes approximately 286,000 loans for which servicing transferred to third parties as of June 30, 2013 , with an effective MSR sale date of July 1, 2013, totaling approximately $49 billion of unpaid principal balance. Retail first mortgage loan originations for the total Corporation were $25.3 billion and $49.2 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $18.0 billion and $33.2 billion for the same periods in 2012 . The increase of $7.3 billion for the three-month period and $16.0 billion for the six-month period was primarily driven by increased market share due to increased fulfillment capacity and an increase in the overall market demand for mortgages. Given the recent increase in interest rates, we expect the overall mortgage market to decline which will have an adverse impact on our mortgage loan originations, particularly our refinance originations. Our mortgage origination pipeline decreased five percent at June 30, 2013 compared to March 31, 2013 . Home equity production was $1.5 billion and $2.6 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $930 million and $1.7 billion for the same periods in 2012 with the increase due to a higher demand in the market based on improving housing trends, and increased market share driven by improved banking center engagement with customers and more competitive pricing. 43 Table of Contents Mortgage Servicing Rights At June 30, 2013 , the consumer MSR balance was $5.8 billion , which represented 77 bps of the related unpaid principal balance compared to $5.7 billion , or 55 bps of the related unpaid principal balance at December 31, 2012 . The consumer MSR balance increase d $111 million in the six months ended June 30, 2013 primarily driven by higher mortgage rates, which resulted in lower forecasted prepayment speeds, largely offset by MSR sales and the change in the MSR asset value due to the impact of customer payments received during the period. For more information on our servicing activities, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Servicing, Foreclosure and Other Mortgage Matters on page 65 . For more information on MSRs, see Note 19 Mortgage Servicing Rights to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Sales of Mortgage Servicing Rights As previously disclosed, during the first quarter of 2013, we entered into definitive agreements with certain counterparties, and on April 1, 2013 with an additional counterparty to sell the servicing rights on certain residential mortgage loans serviced for others, with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of approximately $314 billion . The sales involve approximately 2.1 million loans serviced by us as of the applicable contract dates, including approximately 202,000 residential mortgage loans and approximately 15,000 home equity loans that were 60 days or more past due based upon current estimates. The transfers of servicing rights are occurring in stages throughout 2013, and more than half of the servicing had been transferred as of June 30, 2013 . Certain of the transfers are subject to the approval or consent of certain third parties. There is no assurance that all the required approvals and consents will be obtained, and accordingly, some of these transfers may not be consummated. We expect that the sales, when completed, will ultimately lead to a reduction in servicing revenue of approximately $150 million per quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. 44 Table of Contents Global Banking (1) Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 (Dollars in millions) 2013 2012 % Change 2013 2012 % Change Net interest income (FTE basis) $ 2,252 $ 1,940 16 % $ 4,412 $ 4,027 10 % Noninterest income: Service charges 701 726 (3 ) 1,387 1,448 (4 ) Investment banking fees 792 638 24 1,582 1,289 23 All other income 394 604 (35 ) 788 1,173 (33 ) Total noninterest income 1,887 1,968 (4 ) 3,757 3,910 (4 ) Total revenue, net of interest expense (FTE basis) 4,139 3,908 6 8,169 7,937 3 Provision for credit losses 163 (152 ) n/m 312 (427 ) n/m Noninterest expense 1,859 1,967 (5 ) 3,696 3,928 (6 ) Income before income taxes 2,117 2,093 1 4,161 4,436 (6 ) Income tax expense (FTE basis) 826 775 7 1,586 1,634 (3 ) Net income $ 1,291 $ 1,318 (2 ) $ 2,575 $ 2,802 (8 ) Net interest yield (FTE basis) 3.15 % 2.89 % 3.16 % 2.96 % Return on average allocated capital (2) 22.52 22.58 Return on average economic capital (2) 27.24 29.31 Efficiency ratio (FTE basis) 44.94 50.33 45.25 49.48 Balance Sheet Average Total loans and leases $ 255,674 $ 219,504 16 $ 249,903 $ 221,854 13 Total earning assets 286,522 270,190 6 281,743 273,170 3 Total assets 327,531 311,043 5 322,814 314,088 3 Total deposits 227,668 213,862 6 224,909 212,638 6 Allocated capital (2) 23,000 n/m 23,000 n/m Economic capital (2) 19,472 n/m 19,243 n/m Period end June 30 2013 December 31 2012 Total loans and leases $ 258,502 $ 242,340 7 Total earning assets 293,733 289,036 2 Total assets 334,820 331,611 1 Total deposits 229,586 243,306 (6 ) (1) During the second quarter of 2013, the results of consumer Dealer Financial Services, previously reported in Global Banking , were moved to CBB.

Global Corporate Banking includes large global corporations, financial institutions and leasing clients. Three Months Ended June 30, 2013 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2012 Net income for Global Banking remained relatively unchanged as an increase in the provision for credit losses was largely offset by higher revenue and lower noninterest expense. Revenue increased $231 million to $4.1 billion as higher net interest income and investment banking fees were partially offset by lower other income due to gains on liquidation of certain portfolios in the prior-year period. The provision for credit losses increased $315 million to $163 million from a benefit of $152 million primarily as a result of commercial loan growth. In the year-ago quarter, charge-offs exceeded provision, which resulted in a net reduction in the reserve of $272 million. Noninterest expense decreased $108 million to $1.9 billion primarily due to lower personnel expenses. Six Months Ended June 30, 2013 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2012 Net income for Global Banking decreased $227 million to $2.6 billion primarily driven by an increase in the provision for credit losses partially offset by higher revenue and lower noninterest expense, primarily driven by the same factors as described in the three-months discussion above. 46 Table of Contents Global Corporate and Global Commercial Banking Global Corporate and Global Commercial Banking each include Business Lending and Global Treasury Services activities. Business Lending includes various lending-related products and services including commercial loans, leases, commitment facilities, trade finance, real estate lending and asset-based lending.

Business Lending revenue in Global Corporate Banking improved slightly for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012 as the impact on revenue of growth in loan balances was offset by lower accretion on acquired portfolios and gains on liquidation of certain portfolios in the prior-year periods. Business Lending revenue in Global Commercial Banking increased $141 million and $201 million as growth in the commercial and industrial, and commercial real estate portfolios, as well as higher accretion on acquired portfolios compared to the prior-year periods, offset the impact of the low rate environment. Global Treasury Services revenue increased $71 million and $17 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012 driven by growth in U.S. and non-U.S. deposit balances and the impact of the low rate environment. 47 Table of Contents Average loans and leases in Global Corporate and Global Commercial Banking increased 17 percent and 13 percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012 driven by growth in commercial and industrial, and commercial real estate portfolios from higher client demand. Average deposits in Global Corporate and Global Commercial Banking increased six percent for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012 due to client liquidity, international growth and limited alternative investment options. Investment Banking Client teams and product specialists underwrite and distribute debt, equity and other loan products, and provide advisory services and tailored risk management solutions.

These increases were partially offset by a decline in advisory fees. 48 Table of Contents Global Markets Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 (Dollars in millions) 2013 2012 % Change 2013 2012 % Change Net interest income (FTE basis) $ 1,013 $ 721 40 % $ 2,122 $ 1,628 30 % Noninterest income: Investment and brokerage services 549 448 23 1,077 962 12 Investment banking fees 668 438 53 1,347 994 36 Trading account profits 1,848 1,706 8 4,738 3,744 27 All other income (loss) 111 265 (58 ) (226 ) 657 n/m Total noninterest income 3,176 2,857 11 6,936 6,357 9 Total revenue, net of interest expense (FTE basis) 4,189 3,578 17 9,058 7,985 13 Provision for credit losses (16 ) (1 ) n/m (11 ) (14 ) (21 ) Noninterest expense 2,769 2,855 (3 ) 5,842 6,090 (4 ) Income before income taxes 1,436 724 98 3,227 1,909 69 Income tax expense (FTE basis) 477 227 110 1,099 583 89 Net income $ 959 $ 497 93 $ 2,128 $ 1,326 60 Return on average allocated capital (1) 12.85 % 14.33 % Return on average economic capital (1) 15.10 % 19.32 % Efficiency ratio (FTE basis) 66.12 79.79 64.50 76.27 Balance Sheet Average Total trading-related assets (2) $ 490,972 $ 459,869 7 $ 497,582 $ 454,300 10 Total earning assets (2) 499,396 456,552 9 504,516 446,695 13 Total assets 653,116 596,861 9 660,151 585,423 13 Allocated capital (1) 30,000 n/m 30,000 n/m Economic capital (1) 13,316 n/m 13,849 n/m Period end June 30 2013 December 31 2012 Total trading-related assets (2) $ 446,505 $ 465,836 (4 ) Total earning assets (2) 465,166 486,470 (4 ) Total assets 607,050 630,570 (4 ) (1) Effective January 1, 2013, we revised, on a prospective basis, the methodology for allocating capital to the business segments . In connection with the change in methodology, we updated the applicable terminology in the above table to allocated capital from economic capital as reported in prior periods. For additional information, see Business Segment Operations on page 30 . (2) Trading-related assets include derivative assets, which are considered non-earning assets. n/m = not meaningful Global Markets offers sales and trading services, including research, to institutional clients across fixed-income, credit, currency, commodity and equity businesses. Global Markets product coverage includes securities and derivative products in both the primary and secondary markets. Global Markets provides market-making, financing, securities clearing, settlement and custody services globally to our institutional investor clients in support of their investing and trading activities. We also work with our commercial and corporate clients to provide risk management products using interest rate, equity, credit, currency and commodity derivatives, foreign exchange, fixed-income and mortgage-related products. As a result of our market-making activities in these products, we may be required to manage risk in government securities, equity and equity-linked securities, high-grade and high-yield corporate debt securities, MBS, commodities and asset-backed securities (ABS). In addition, the economics of most investment banking and underwriting activities are shared primarily between Global Markets and Global Banking based on the activities performed by each segment . Global Banking originates certain deal-related transactions with our corporate and commercial clients that are executed and distributed by Global Markets. For more information on investment banking fees on a consolidated basis, see page 48 . 49 Table of Contents Three Months Ended June 30, 2013 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2012 Net income for Global Markets increased $462 million to $959 million . Net DVA gains on derivatives were $38 million compared to net DVA losses of $156 million . Excluding net DVA, net income increased $340 million to $935 million primarily driven by higher equities revenue and lower noninterest expense, partially offset by lower FICC revenue. Noninterest expense decreased $86 million to $2.8 billion due to a reduction in operating costs. Average earning assets increased $42.8 billion to $499.4 billion largely driven by increased client financing activity in the equities business. Six Months Ended June 30, 2013 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2012 Net income for Global Markets increased $802 million to $2.1 billion . Net DVA losses on derivatives were $17 million compared to $1.6 billion . Excluding net DVA, net income decreased $189 million to $2.1 billion primarily driven by lower FICC revenue partially offset by higher equities revenue and lower noninterest expense. Noninterest expense decreased $248 million to $5.8 billion due to the same factor as described in the three-month discussion above. Average earning assets increased $57.8 billion to $504.5 billion largely driven by the same factor described in the three-month discussion above. Sales and Trading Revenue Sales and trading revenue includes unrealized and realized gains and losses on trading and other assets, net interest income, and fees primarily from commissions on equity securities. Sales and trading revenue is segregated into fixed income (government debt obligations, investment and non-investment grade corporate debt obligations, CMBS, RMBS, collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), interest rate and credit derivative contracts), currencies (interest rate and foreign exchange contracts), commodities (primarily futures, forwards, swaps and options) and equities (equity-linked derivatives and cash equity activity). The table below and related discussion present sales and trading revenue, substantially all of which is in Global Markets with the remainder in Global Banking . In addition, the table below and related discussion present sales and trading revenue excluding DVA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe the use of this non-GAAP financial measure provides clarity in assessing the underlying performance of these businesses. Sales and Trading Revenue (1, 2) Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 (Dollars in millions) 2013 2012 2013 2012 Sales and trading revenue Fixed income, currencies and commodities $ 2,292 $ 2,418 $ 5,228 $ 5,261 Equities 1,199 761 2,358 1,673 Total sales and trading revenue $ 3,491 $ 3,179 $ 7,586 $ 6,934 Sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA (3) Fixed income, currencies and commodities $ 2,259 $ 2,555 $ 5,260 $ 6,685 Equities 1,194 780 2,343 1,839 Total sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA $ 3,453 $ 3,335 $ 7,603 $ 8,524 (1) Includes FTE adjustments of $44 million and $90 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $59 million and $109 million for the same periods in 2012 . For more information on sales and trading revenue, see Note 3 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . (2) Includes Global Banking sales and trading revenue of $142 million and $210 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $248 million and $363 million for the same periods in 2012 . (3) For this presentation, sales and trading revenue excludes the impact of credit spreads on DVA which represents a non-GAAP financial measure. Net DVA gains of $33 million and net DVA losses of $32 million were included in FICC revenue, and net DVA gains of $5 million and $15 million were included in equities revenue for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to net DVA losses of $137 million and $1.4 billion , and $19 million and $166 million for the same periods in 2012 . 50 Table of Contents Three Months Ended June 30, 2013 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2012 FICC revenue, including net DVA, decreased $126 million to $2.3 billion . Excluding net DVA, FICC revenue decreased $296 million to $2.3 billion primarily driven by a challenging trading environment toward the end of the quarter as fixed-income assets sold off due to market concerns related to the Federal Reserve's policy announcement in June , primarily in interest rate sensitive products, as well as the result of a gain on the sale of an equity investment in the prior-year period and less favorable conditions in structured credit markets. Equities revenue, including net DVA, increased $438 million to $1.2 billion . Excluding net DVA, equities revenue increased $414 million to $1.2 billion primarily due to increased market share across the cash equities businesses, improved performance in equity derivatives and increased financing activity. Sales and trading revenue included total commissions and brokerage fee revenue of $549 million compared to $448 million , substantially all from equities. The $101 million increase in commissions and brokerage fee revenue was primarily due to a higher market share in equities. Six Months Ended June 30, 2013 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2012 FICC revenue, including net DVA, decreased $33 million to $5.2 billion . Excluding the impact of credit spreads on net DVA, FICC revenue decreased $1.4 billion to $5.3 billion primarily resulting from a write-down of a receivable related to the MBIA Settlement in the first quarter of 2013 as well as the same factors described in the three-month discussion above. For more information on the MBIA Settlement, see Note 8 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Equities revenue, including net DVA, increased $685 million to $2.4 billion . Excluding the impact of credit spreads on net DVA, equities revenue increased $504 million to $2.3 billion due to the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above. Sales and trading revenue included total commissions and brokerage fee revenue of $1.1 billion compared to $962 million , substantially all from equities. Commissions and brokerage fee revenue increased $115 million due to the same factor described in the three-month discussion above. 51 Table of Contents Global Wealth & Investment Management Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 (Dollars in millions) 2013 2012 % Change 2013 2012 % Change Net interest income (FTE basis) $ 1,505 $ 1,393 8 % $ 3,101 $ 2,924 6 % Noninterest income: Investment and brokerage services 2,441 2,221 10 4,772 4,396 9 All other income 553 480 15 1,047 921 14 Total noninterest income 2,994 2,701 11 5,819 5,317 9 Total revenue, net of interest expense (FTE basis) 4,499 4,094 10 8,920 8,241 8 Provision for credit losses (15 ) 47 n/m 7 93 (92 ) Noninterest expense 3,272 3,177 3 6,525 6,409 2 Income before income taxes 1,242 870 43 2,388 1,739 37 Income tax expense (FTE basis) 484 322 50 910 641 42 Net income $ 758 $ 548 38 $ 1,478 $ 1,098 35 Net interest yield (FTE basis) 2.47 % 2.31 % 2.46 % 2.38 % Return on average allocated capital (1) 30.57 29.98 Return on average economic capital (1) 31.76 33.24 Efficiency ratio (FTE basis) 72.72 77.61 73.15 77.77 Balance Sheet Average Total loans and leases $ 109,589 $ 98,964 11 $ 107,845 $ 98,490 9 Total earning assets 244,845 242,843 1 254,113 246,785 3 Total assets 263,735 262,124 1 272,965 265,899 3 Total deposits 235,344 238,540 (1 ) 244,329 239,200 2 Allocated capital (1) 10,000 n/m 10,000 n/m Economic capital (1) 7,011 n/m 6,716 n/m Period end June 30 2013 December 31 2012 Total loans and leases $ 111,785 $ 105,928 6 Total earning assets 244,361 277,103 (12 ) Total assets 263,867 297,326 (11 ) Total deposits 235,012 266,188 (12 ) (1) Effective January 1, 2013, we revised, on a prospective basis, the methodology for allocating capital to the business segments . In connection with the change in methodology, we updated the applicable terminology in the above table to allocated capital from economic capital as reported in prior periods. For additional information, see Business Segment Operations on page 30 . n/m = not meaningful GWIM consists of two primary businesses: Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management (MLGWM) and U.S. Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management (U.S. Trust). MLGWM's advisory business provides a high-touch client experience through a network of financial advisors focused on clients with over $250,000 in total investable assets. MLGWM provides tailored solutions to meet our clients' needs through a full set of brokerage, banking and retirement products. U.S. Trust, together with MLGWM's Private Banking & Investments Group, provides comprehensive wealth management solutions targeted to wealthy and ultra-wealthy clients with investable assets of more than $5 million, as well as customized solutions to meet clients' wealth structuring, investment management, trust and banking needs, including specialty asset management services. 52 Table of Contents Three Months Ended June 30, 2013 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2012 Net income increased $210 million to $758 million , a record since the Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. (Merrill Lynch) merger, driven by higher revenue and lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Revenue increased $405 million to $4.5 billion , also a post-merger record, primarily driven by higher asset management fees related to higher market levels and long-term AUM flows, increased transactional revenue and higher net interest income. The provision for credit losses decreased $62 million to a benefit of $15 million driven by continued credit quality improvement. Noninterest expense increased $95 million to $3.3 billion as higher volume-driven expenses and support costs were partially offset by lower non-volume driven personnel costs. Revenue from MLGWM was $3.7 billion , up 10 percent , and revenue from U.S. Trust was $740 million , up eight percent , both driven by higher noninterest income and net interest income. Six Months Ended June 30, 2013 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2012 Net income increased $380 million to $1.5 billion driven by higher revenue and lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Revenue increased $679 million to $8.9 billion . The provision for credit losses decreased $86 million to $7 million . These changes were driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above. Noninterest expense increased $116 million to $6.5 billion driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above, as well as higher litigation expenses. Revenue from MLGWM was $7.4 billion , up nine percent , and revenue from U.S. Trust was $1.5 billion , up seven percent , both driven by higher noninterest income and net interest income. Net Migration Summary GWIM results are impacted by the migration of clients and their related deposit and loan balances to or from CBB , CRES and the ALM portfolio, as presented in the table below. We move clients between business segments to better meet the needs of our clients. The table below includes the first quarter transfer whereby GWIM identified and transferred deposit balances of approximately $19 billion to CBB . Additionally, beginning in 2013, the revenue and expense associated with GWIM clients that hold credit cards is included in GWIM. Revenue and expense for prior periods are in CBB.

Such allocated assets were $525.9 billion and $526.7 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $492.7 billion and $489.9 billion for the same periods in 2012 , and $530.3 billion and $538.5 billion at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 . n/m = not meaningful All Other consists of ALM activities, equity investments, the international consumer card business, liquidating businesses, residual expense allocations and other. ALM activities encompass the whole-loan residential mortgage portfolio and investment securities, interest rate and foreign currency risk management activities including the residual net interest income allocation, gains/losses on structured liabilities, the impact of certain allocation methodologies and accounting hedge ineffectiveness. For more information on our ALM activities, see Interest Rate Risk Management for Nontrading Activities on page 130 . Equity investments include Global Principal Investments (GPI) which is comprised of a diversified portfolio of equity, real estate and other alternative investments. These investments are made either directly in a company or held through a fund with related income recorded in equity investment income. Equity investments 55 Table of Contents also include strategic investments, which include our investment in China Construction Bank Corporation (CCB) and certain other investments. Additionally, All Other includes certain residential mortgage loans that are managed by Legacy Assets & Servicing. In January 2013, in connection with the FNMA Settlement, we repurchased certain residential mortgage loans, all of which are held in All Other . For additional information, see Note 8 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Three Months Ended June 30, 2013 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2012 Net income for All Other increased $913 million to $549 million primarily due to a $714 million reduction in the provision for credit losses, an increase of $612 million in equity investment income and a decrease in noninterest expense of $564 million . Partially offsetting these items were $505 million in gains related to liability management actions in the prior-year period. Fair value adjustments on structured liabilities related to the widening of our credit spreads were positive $10 million compared to negative $62 million in the prior-year period. The provision for credit losses decreased $714 million to a benefit of $179 million primarily driven by continued improvement in portfolio trends including increased home prices in the residential mortgage portfolio. Noninterest expense decreased $564 million to $541 million primarily due to lower litigation expense and personnel expense. The income tax benefit was $338 million compared to a benefit of $678 million , with the decrease primarily attributable to the change in pre-tax income (loss) in All Other . Six Months Ended June 30, 2013 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2012 The net loss for All Other decreased $2.5 billion to $423 million primarily due to negative fair value adjustments on structured liabilities of $80 million related to the improvement in our credit spreads compared to $3.4 billion in the same period in 2012 , a $1.7 billion reduction in the provision for credit losses, a decrease in noninterest expense of $1.3 billion and an increase in equity investment income of $702 million . Partially offsetting these items were $1.7 billion in gains related to liability management actions in the prior-year period and a decrease of $547 million in gains on sales of debt securities. The provision for credit losses decreased $1.7 billion to $71 million primarily driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above. Noninterest expense decreased $1.3 billion to $2.3 billion due to lower litigation and personnel expenses. The income tax benefit was $1.0 billion compared to a benefit of $2.2 billion , with the decrease primarily attributable to the decrease in the pre-tax loss in All Other . 56 Table of Contents Equity Investment Activity The tables below present the components of equity investments included in All Other at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 , and also a reconciliation to the total consolidated equity investment income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 .

GPI had unfunded equity commitments of $161 million at June 30, 2013 compared to $224 million at December 31, 2012 . At June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 , we owned 2.0 billion shares representing approximately one percent of CCB. Sales restrictions on these shares continue until the end of August 2013. Because the sales restrictions on these shares will expire within one year, these securities are classified as AFS marketable equity securities and carried at fair value with the after-tax unrealized gain included in accumulated OCI. At June 30, 2013 , the cost basis was $716 million and the fair value was $1.3 billion . Equity investment income included in All Other was $576 million and $1.1 billion in the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 , an increase of $612 million and $702 million from the same periods in 2012 . The increases in the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 were primarily due to a gain on the sale of an equity investment. Total Corporation equity investment income was $680 million and $1.2 billion in the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 , an increase of $312 million and $110 million from the same periods in 2012 , as the gains on the sales of an equity investment in All Other were partially offset by prior-year periods gains on the sales of an equity investment in Global Markets . 57 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have contractual obligations to make future payments on debt and lease agreements. Additionally, in the normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements whereby we commit to future purchases of products or services from unaffiliated parties.

Representations and Warranties We securitize first-lien residential mortgage loans generally in the form of MBS guaranteed by the GSEs or by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) in the case of Federal Housing Administration (FHA)-insured, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)-guaranteed and Rural Housing Service-guaranteed mortgage loans. In addition, in prior years, legacy companies and certain subsidiaries sold pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans and home equity loans as private-label securitizations (in certain of these securitizations, monolines or financial guarantee providers insured all or some of the securities) or in the form of whole loans. In connection with these transactions, we or certain of our subsidiaries or legacy companies make or have made various representations and warranties. Breaches of these representations and warranties may result in the requirement to repurchase mortgage loans or to otherwise make whole or provide other remedies to the GSEs, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) with respect to FHA-insured loans, VA, whole-loan investors, securitization trusts, monoline insurers or other financial guarantors (collectively, repurchases). In all such cases, we would be exposed to any credit loss on the repurchased mortgage loans after accounting for any mortgage insurance (MI) or mortgage guarantee payments that we may receive. Subject to the requirements and limitations of the applicable sales and securitization agreements, these representations and warranties can be enforced by the GSEs, HUD, VA, the whole-loan investor, the securitization trustee or others as governed by the applicable agreement or, in certain first-lien and home equity securitizations where monoline insurers or other financial guarantee providers have insured all or some of the securities issued, by the monoline insurer or other financial guarantor, where the contract so provides. In the case of private-label securitizations, the applicable agreements may permit investors, which may include the GSEs, with contractually sufficient holdings to direct or influence action by the securitization trustee. In the case of loans sold to parties other than the GSEs or GNMA, the contractual liability to repurchase typically arises only if there is a breach of the representations and warranties that materially and adversely affects the interest of the investor, or investors, or of the monoline insurer or other financial guarantor (as applicable) in the loan. Contracts with the GSEs do not contain equivalent language, while GNMA generally limits repurchases to loans that are not insured or guaranteed as required. For additional information about accounting for representations and warranties and our representations and warranties repurchase claims and exposures, see Note 8 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees and Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation's 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Representations and Warranties Bulk Settlement Actions We have settled, or entered into agreements to settle, certain bulk representations and warranties claims (1) with each of the GSEs in 2010 (2010 GSE Agreements), (2) with a trustee (the Trustee) for certain Countrywide Financial Corporation (Countrywide) private-label securitization trusts in 2011 (the BNY Mellon Settlement), (3) with three monoline insurers, Assured Guaranty Ltd. and subsidiaries in 2011 (the Assured Guaranty Settlement), Syncora Guarantee Inc. and Syncora Holdings, Ltd. in 2012 (the Syncora Settlement) and MBIA pursuant to the MBIA Settlement in 2013, and (4) with FNMA pursuant to the FNMA Settlement in 2013. We have vigorously contested any request for repurchase when we conclude that a valid basis for repurchase does not exist and will continue to do so in the future. However, in an effort to resolve these legacy mortgage-related issues, we have reached bulk settlements, or agreements for bulk settlements, including settlement amounts which have been material, with the above-referenced counterparties in lieu of a loan-by-loan review process. For instance, in the first quarter of 2013, we entered into the FNMA Settlement to resolve substantially all outstanding and potential repurchase and certain other claims relating to the origination, sale and delivery of residential mortgage loans originated from January 1, 2000 through December 31, 2008 and sold directly to FNMA by entities related to Countrywide and BANA. We may reach other settlements in the future if opportunities arise on terms we believe to be advantageous. However, there can be no assurance that we will reach future settlements or, if we do, that the terms of past settlements can be relied upon to predict the terms of future settlements. For a summary of the larger bulk settlement actions and the related impact on the representations and warranties provision and liability, see Note 8 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees herein and Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K . These 58 Table of Contents bulk settlements generally did not cover all transactions with the relevant counterparties or all potential claims that may arise, including in some instances securities law, fraud and servicing claims, and our liability in connection with the transactions and claims not covered by these settlements could be material. BNY Mellon Settlement The BNY Mellon Settlement, entered into in June 2011, is subject to final court approval and certain other conditions. The court approval hearing on the settlement began on June 3, 2013 in the New York Supreme Court, New York County, and additional hearing days are currently scheduled in September 2013. Although we are not a party to the proceeding, certain of our rights and obligations under the settlement agreement are conditioned on final court approval of the settlement. There can be no assurance that final court approval of the BNY Mellon Settlement will be obtained, that all conditions to the BNY Mellon Settlement will be satisfied or, if certain conditions to the BNY Mellon Settlement permitting withdrawal are met, that we and Countrywide will not withdraw from the settlement. If final court approval is not obtained or if we and Countrywide withdraw from the BNY Mellon Settlement in accordance with its terms, our future representations and warranties losses could be substantially different than existing accruals and the estimated range of possible loss over existing accruals. For more information about the risks associated with the BNY Mellon Settlement, see Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation's 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K . MBIA Settlement On May 7, 2013, we entered into the MBIA Settlement which resolved all outstanding litigation between the parties, as well as other claims between the parties, including outstanding and potential claims from MBIA related to alleged representations and warranties breaches and other claims involving certain first- and second-lien RMBS trusts for which MBIA provided financial guarantee insurance, certain of which claims were the subject of litigation. At the time of the settlement, the mortgages (first- and second-lien) in RMBS trusts covered by the MBIA Settlement had an original principal balance of $54.8 billion and an unpaid principal balance of $19.1 billion . For additional information, see Recent Events MBIA Settlement on page 8 , the Experience with Investors Other than Government-sponsored Enterprises Monoline Insurers section herein, and Note 8 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Unresolved Claims Status Unresolved Repurchase Claims During the three months ended June 30, 2013 , we received $1.3 billion in new repurchase claims, including $529 million submitted by the GSEs for both Countrywide and legacy Bank of America originations not covered by the bulk settlements with the GSEs, $666 million submitted by private-label securitization trustees, $134 million submitted by whole-loan investors and $2 million submitted by monoline insurers. During the three months ended June 30, 2013 , $1.7 billion in claims were resolved, including $945 million resolved through the MBIA Settlement. Of the remaining claims that were resolved, $436 million were resolved through rescissions and $364 million were resolved through mortgage repurchases and make-whole payments primarily with the GSEs. During the six months ended June 30, 2013 , we received $3.1 billion in new repurchase claims, including $927 million submitted by the GSEs for both Countrywide and legacy Bank of America originations not covered by the bulk settlements with the GSEs, $1.9 billion submitted by private-label securitization trustees, $268 million submitted by whole-loan investors and $44 million submitted by monoline insurers. During the six months ended June 30, 2013 , $14.7 billion in claims were resolved, primarily with the GSEs, including $12.2 billion in GSE claims resolved through the FNMA Settlement and $945 million resolved through the MBIA Settlement. Of the remaining claims that were resolved, $845 million were resolved through rescissions and $675 million were resolved through mortgage repurchases and make-whole payments, primarily with the GSEs. For more information on unresolved repurchase claims from the GSEs, monoline insurers, private-label securitization trustees, whole-loan investors and others, and the resolution of such claims, see Note 8 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements . At June 30, 2013 , the total notional amount of our unresolved representations and warranties repurchase claims was $16.6 billion compared to $28.3 billion at December 31, 2012 . These repurchase claims do not include any repurchase claims related to the trusts covered by the BNY Mellon Settlement. Unresolved repurchase claims represent the notional amount of repurchase claims made by counterparties, typically the outstanding principal balance or the unpaid principal balance at the time of default. In the case of first-lien mortgages, the claim amount is often significantly greater than the expected loss amount due to the benefit of collateral and, in some cases, MI or mortgage guarantee payments. Claims received from a counterparty remain outstanding until the underlying loan is repurchased, the claim is rescinded by the counterparty, or the claim is otherwise resolved. When a claim is denied and we do not receive a response from the counterparty, the claim remains in the unresolved repurchase claims balance until resolution. 59 Table of Contents The notional amount of unresolved GSE repurchase claims totaled $1.1 billion at June 30, 2013 compared to $13.5 billion at December 31, 2012 . As a result of the FNMA Settlement, $12.2 billion of GSE repurchase claims outstanding at December 31, 2012 were resolved in January 2013. The notional amount of unresolved monoline repurchase claims totaled $1.5 billion at June 30, 2013 compared to $2.4 billion at December 31, 2012 . We have had limited loan-level repurchase claims experience with the majority of the monoline insurers due to ongoing litigation. In our experience, the monolines have been generally unwilling to withdraw repurchase claims, regardless of whether and what evidence was offered to refute a claim. Substantially all of the unresolved monoline claims pertain to second-lien loans and are currently the subject of litigation. As a result of the MBIA Settlement, $945 million of monoline repurchase claims outstanding at December 31, 2012 were resolved in May 2013. The notional amount of unresolved repurchase claims from private-label securitization trustees, whole-loan investors, including third-party securitization sponsors and others totaled $14.0 billion at June 30, 2013 compared to $12.3 billion at December 31, 2012 . The increase in the notional amount of unresolved repurchase claims is primarily due to continued submission of claims by private-label securitization trustees; the level of detail, support and analysis which impacts overall claim quality and, therefore, claims resolution; and the lack of an established process to resolve disputes related to these claims. We expect unresolved repurchase claims related to private-label securitizations to continue to increase as claims continue to be submitted by private-label securitization trustees and there is not an established process for the ultimate resolution of claims on which there is a disagreement. In addition to, and not included in, the total unresolved repurchase claims of $16.6 billion at June 30, 2013 , we have received repurchase demands from private-label securitization investors and a master servicer where we believe the claimants have not satisfied the contractual thresholds to direct the securitization trustee to take action and/or that these demands are otherwise procedurally or substantively invalid. The total amounts outstanding of such demands were $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 , comprised of $1.3 billion of demands received during 2012 and approximately $300 million of demands related to trusts covered by the BNY Mellon Settlement. We do not believe that the $1.5 billion of demands outstanding at June 30, 2013 represents valid repurchase claims and, therefore, it is not possible to predict the resolution with respect to such demands. Open Mortgage Insurance Rescission Notices In addition to repurchase claims, we receive notices from mortgage insurance companies of claim denials, cancellations or coverage rescission (collectively, MI rescission notices). Although the number of such notices has remained elevated, they have decreased over the last several quarters as the resolution of open notices exceeded new notices. At June 30, 2013 , we had approximately 106,000 open MI rescission notices compared to 110,000 at December 31, 2012 . Open MI rescission notices at June 30, 2013 included 45,000 pertaining principally to first-lien mortgages serviced for others, 10,000 pertaining to loans held-for-investment (HFI) and 51,000 pertaining to ongoing litigation for second-lien mortgages. Approximately 25,000 of the open MI rescission notices pertaining to first-lien mortgages serviced for others are related to loans sold to FNMA. As of June 30, 2013 , 38 percent of the MI rescission notices received have been resolved. Of those resolved, 18 percent were resolved through our acceptance of the MI rescission, 61 percent were resolved through reinstatement of coverage or payment of the claim by the mortgage insurance company, and 21 percent were resolved on an aggregate basis through settlement, policy commutation or similar arrangement. As of June 30, 2013 , 62 percent of the MI rescission notices we have received have not yet been resolved. Of those not yet resolved, 48 percent are implicated by ongoing litigation where no loan-level review is currently contemplated or required to preserve our legal rights. In this litigation, the litigating mortgage insurance companies are also seeking bulk rescission of certain policies, separate and apart from loan-by-loan denials or rescissions. We are in the process of reviewing 41 percent of the remaining open MI rescission notices, and we have reviewed and are contesting the MI rescission with respect to 59 percent of these remaining open MI rescission notices. Of the remaining open MI rescission notices, 44 percent are also the subject of ongoing litigation; although, at present, these MI rescissions are being processed in a manner generally consistent with those not affected by litigation. Although the FNMA Settlement did not resolve underlying MI rescission notices, the FNMA Settlement resolved significant representations and warranties exposures, including unresolved and potential repurchase claims from FNMA resulting solely from MI rescission notices relating to loans covered by the FNMA Settlement. Our pipeline of unresolved repurchase claims from the GSEs resulting solely from MI rescission notices was $466 million at June 30, 2013 compared to $2.3 billion at December 31, 2012 . The FNMA Settlement resolved approximately $1.9 billion of such unresolved repurchase claims which were outstanding at December 31, 2012. Many of these claims represent repurchase claims on loans for which we received a MI rescission notice that is included in the 25,000 open MI rescission notices referenced in the paragraph above. In addition, the FNMA Settlement clarified the parties' obligations with respect to MI rescission notices including establishing timeframes for certain payments and other actions, setting parameters for potential bulk settlements and providing for cooperation in future dealings with mortgage insurers. As a result, we are required to pay the amount of certain MI coverage to FNMA as a result of MI claims rescissions in advance of collection from the mortgage insurance companies and have remitted the amounts required under the agreement related to the 25,000 open MI rescission notices. In certain cases, we may not ultimately collect all such amounts from the mortgage insurance companies. For additional information, see Off-Balance Sheet 60 Table of Contents Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Unresolved Claims Status Open Mortgage Insurance Rescission Notices on page 57 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Representations and Warranties Liability The liability for representations and warranties and corporate guarantees is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the related provision is included in mortgage banking income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The liability for representations and warranties exposures and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss do not consider any losses related to litigation matters, including litigation brought by monoline insurers, nor do they include any separate foreclosure costs and related costs, assessments and compensatory fees or any other possible losses related to potential claims for breaches of performance of servicing obligations, except as such losses are included as potential costs of the BNY Mellon Settlement, potential securities law or fraud claims or potential indemnity or other claims against us, including claims related to loans insured by the FHA. We are not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any possible loss with respect to any such servicing, securities law, fraud or other claims against us, except to the extent reflected in the estimated range of possible loss for litigation and regulatory matters disclosed in Note 11 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements ; however, such loss could be material. At June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 , the liability for representations and warranties and corporate guarantees was $14.0 billion and $19.0 billion , with the decrease primarily driven by the payment and repurchase of loans related to the FNMA Settlement. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 , the representations and warranties and corporate guarantees provision was $197 million and $447 million compared to $395 million and $677 million for the same periods in 2012 . The provision for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 was primarily driven by remaining GSE exposures and, to a lesser extent, by our obligations related to MI rescissions. Estimated Range of Possible Loss Our estimated liability at June 30, 2013 for obligations under representations and warranties is necessarily dependent on, and limited by, a number of factors, including for private-label securitizations, the implied repurchase experience based on the BNY Mellon Settlement, as well as certain other assumptions and judgmental factors. Accordingly, future provisions associated with obligations under representations and warranties may be materially impacted if actual experiences are different from historical experience or our understandings, interpretations or assumptions. In the case of non-GSE exposures, including private-label securitizations, our estimate of the representations and warranties liability and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss considers, among other things, repurchase experience based on the BNY Mellon Settlement, adjusted to reflect differences between the trusts covered by the BNY Mellon Settlement (Covered Trusts) and the remainder of the population of private-label securitizations, and assumes that the conditions to the BNY Mellon Settlement will be met. Where relevant, we also take into account more recent experience, such as increased claim activity, our experience with various counterparties and other facts and circumstances, such as bulk settlements, as we believe appropriate. The representations and warranties liability represents our best estimate of probable incurred losses as of June 30, 2013 . However, it is reasonably possible that future representations and warranties losses may occur in excess of the amounts recorded for these exposures. In addition, we have not recorded any representations and warranties liability for certain potential private-label securitization and whole-loan exposures where we have little to no claim activity. We currently estimate that the range of possible loss for representations and warranties exposures could be up to $4 billion over accruals at June 30, 2013 . The estimated range of possible loss reflects principally non-GSE exposures. The estimated range of possible loss related to these representations and warranties exposures does not represent a probable loss, and is based on currently available information, significant judgment and a number of assumptions that are subject to change. Our estimated range of possible loss related to representations and warranties exposures does not include possible losses related to monoline insurers. Future provisions and/or ranges of possible loss for representations and warranties may be significantly impacted if actual experiences are different from our assumptions in our predictive models, including, without limitation, ultimate resolution of the BNY Mellon Settlement, estimated repurchase rates, estimated MI rescission rates, economic conditions, estimated home prices, consumer and counterparty behavior, and a variety of other judgmental factors. Adverse developments with respect to one or more of the assumptions underlying the liability for representations and warranties and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss could result in significant increases to future provisions and/or the estimated range of possible loss. For example, an appellate court, in the context of claims brought by a monoline insurer, disagreed with our interpretation that a loan must be in default in order to satisfy the underlying agreements' requirement that a breach have a material and adverse effect. If that decision is extended to non-monoline contexts, it could significantly impact our provision and/or the estimated range of possible loss. Additionally, if court rulings related to monoline litigation, including one related to us, that have allowed sampling of loan files instead of requiring a loan-by-loan review to determine if a representations and warranties breach has occurred, are followed generally by the courts in future monoline litigation, private-label securitization counterparties may view litigation as a more attractive alternative compared to a loan-by-loan review. Finally, although we believe that 61 Table of Contents the representations and warranties typically given in non-GSE transactions are less rigorous and actionable than those given in GSE transactions, we do not have significant experience resolving loan-level claims in non-GSE transactions to measure the impact of these differences on the probability that a loan will be required to be repurchased. For more information about the methodology used to estimate the representations and warranties liability and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss for representations and warranties exposures, see Note 8 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements and, for information related to the sensitivity of the assumptions used to estimate our liability for obligations under representations and warranties, see Complex Accounting Estimates Representations and Warranties on page 126 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Experience with Government-sponsored Enterprises As a result of the FNMA Settlement and earlier bulk settlements with the GSEs, our exposure to repurchase claims from the GSEs for vintages prior to 2009 has been significantly reduced. After these settlements, our exposure to representations and warranties liability for loans originated prior to 2009 and sold to the GSEs is limited to loans with an original principal balance of $113.3 billion , sold primarily to Freddie Mac (FHLMC), and loans with certain defects excluded from the settlements that we do not believe will be material, such as title defects and certain specified violations of FNMA's charter. As of June 30, 2013 , of the $113.3 billion , approximately $75.2 billion in principal has been paid, $10.5 billion in principal has defaulted or was severely delinquent and the notional amount of unresolved repurchase claims submitted by the GSEs was $945 million related to these vintages. We have performed an initial review with respect to $724 million of these claims and do not believe a valid basis for repurchase has been established by the claimant and are still in the process of reviewing the remaining $221 million of these claims. The FNMA Settlement and earlier bulk settlements did not address loans originated after 2008 . However, we believe that changes made to our operations and underwriting policies have reduced our exposure to the GSEs related to loans originated after 2008 . In addition, we estimate that lifetime losses on these vintages will be significantly less than the losses we have experienced with respect to vintages prior to 2009 . We have sold $513.6 billion of loans originated after 2008 to the GSEs. At June 30, 2013 , approximately $235.8 billion in principal has been paid, $4.4 billion in principal has defaulted or was severely delinquent and the notional amount of unresolved repurchase claims submitted by the GSEs was $175 million related to these vintages. We have performed an initial review with respect to $145 million of these claims and do not believe a valid basis for repurchase has been established by the claimant and are still in the process of reviewing the remaining $30 million of these claims. Experience with Investors Other than Government-sponsored Enterprises In prior years, legacy companies and certain subsidiaries sold pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans and home equity loans as private-label securitizations or in the form of whole loans originated from 2004 through 2008 with an original principal balance of $963 billion to investors other than GSEs (although the GSEs are investors in certain private-label securitizations), of which $541 billion in principal has been paid, $185 billion in principal has defaulted, $60 billion in principal was severely delinquent and $177 billion in principal was current or less than 180 days past due at June 30, 2013 . 62 Table of Contents Table 15 details the population of loans originated between 2004 and 2008 and the population of loans sold as whole loans or in non-agency securitizations by entity and product together with the defaulted and severely delinquent loans stratified by the number of payments the borrower made prior to default or becoming severely delinquent as of June 30, 2013 . We believe many of the defaults observed in these securitizations have been, and continue to be, driven by external factors like the substantial depreciation in home prices, persistently high unemployment and other negative economic trends, diminishing the likelihood that any loan defect (assuming one exists at all) was the cause of a loan's default. As of June 30, 2013 , approximately 25 percent of the loans sold to non-GSEs that were originated between 2004 and 2008 have defaulted or are severely delinquent. Of the original principal balance for Countrywide, $409 billion is included in the BNY Mellon Settlement and, of this amount, $110 billion was defaulted or severely delinquent at June 30, 2013 .

(2) Includes exposures on third-party sponsored transactions related to legacy entity originations. Monoline Insurers Legacy companies sold $184.5 billion of loans originated between 2004 and 2008 into monoline-insured securitizations, which are included in Table 15 , including $103.9 billion of first-lien mortgages and $80.6 billion of second-lien mortgages. Of these balances, $48.6 billion of the first-lien mortgages and $52.5 billion of the second-lien mortgages have been paid in full, and $34.9 billion of the first-lien mortgages and $17.8 billion of the second-lien mortgages have defaulted or are severely delinquent at June 30, 2013 . At least 25 payments have been made on approximately 58 percent of the defaulted and severely delinquent loans. Of the first-lien mortgages sold, $39.1 billion , or 38 percent , were sold as whole loans to other institutions which subsequently included these loans with those of other originators in private-label securitization transactions in which the monolines insured one or more securities. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 , there was minimal repurchase claim activity with the monolines. At June 30, 2013 , for loans originated between 2004 and 2008 , the unpaid principal balance of loans related to unresolved monoline repurchase claims was $1.5 billion compared to $2.4 billion at December 31, 2012 . At June 30, 2013 , the unpaid principal balance of loans in these vintages for which the monolines had requested loan files for review but for which no repurchase claim had been received was $2.7 billion, excluding loans that had been paid in full or resolved through settlements. Of these file requests, $1.4 billion are aged and subject to ongoing litigation. There will likely be additional requests for loan files in the future leading to repurchase claims. In addition, we have received claims from private-label securitization trustees and a third-party securitization sponsor related to first-lien third-party sponsored securitizations that include monoline insurance. 63 Table of Contents The MBIA Settlement resolved outstanding and potential claims between the parties to the settlement involving 31 first- and 17 second-lien RMBS trusts for which MBIA provided financial guarantee insurance, including $945 million of monoline repurchase claims outstanding at December 31, 2012. In addition, this settlement covered loans with an unpaid principal balance of $2.6 billion for which we have received file requests but for which no repurchase claims were received as of December 31, 2012. The first- and second-lien mortgages in the covered RMBS trusts had an original principal balance of $29.3 billion and $25.5 billion , and an unpaid principal balance of $9.8 billion and $9.3 billion at the time of the settlement. For additional information, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Experience with Investors Other than Government-sponsored Enterprises on page 59 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Whole Loans and Private-label Securitizations Legacy entities, and to a lesser extent Bank of America, sold loans to investors as whole loans or via private-label securitizations. The majority of the loans sold were included in private-label securitizations, including third-party sponsored transactions. We provided representations and warranties to the whole-loan investors and these investors may retain those rights even when the whole loans were aggregated with other collateral into private-label securitizations sponsored by the whole-loan investors. The loans sold with an original total principal balance of $778.2 billion , included in Table 15 , were originated between 2004 and 2008 , of which $439.5 billion have been paid in full and $192.3 billion were defaulted or severely delinquent at June 30, 2013 . At least 25 payments have been made on approximately 64 percent of the defaulted and severely delinquent loans. We have received approximately $21.7 billion of representations and warranties repurchase claims from whole-loan investors, including third-party sponsors, and private-label securitization investors and trustees related to these vintages, including $12.6 billion from private-label securitization trustees, $8.3 billion from whole-loan investors and $811 million from one private-label securitization counterparty. In private-label securitizations, certain presentation thresholds need to be met in order for investors to direct a trustee to assert repurchase claims. Continued high levels of new private-label claims are primarily related to repurchase requests received from trustees and third-party sponsors for private-label securitization transactions not included in the BNY Mellon Settlement, including claims related to first-lien third-party sponsored securitizations that include monoline insurance. Over time, there has been an increase in requests for loan files from certain private-label securitization trustees, as well as requests for tolling agreements to toll the applicable statute of limitations relating to representations and warranties repurchase claims, and we believe it is likely that these requests will lead to an increase in repurchase claims from private-label securitization trustees with standing to bring such claims. In addition, private-label securitization trustees may have obtained loan files through other means, including litigation and administrative subpoenas. We have resolved $7.8 billion of the claims received from whole-loan investors and private-label securitization investors and trustees with losses of $1.8 billion . The majority of these resolved claims were from third-party whole-loan investors. Approximately $3.2 billion of these claims were resolved through repurchase or indemnification and $4.6 billion were rescinded by the investor. At June 30, 2013 , for loans originated between 2004 and 2008 , the notional amount of unresolved repurchase claims submitted by private-label securitization trustees and whole-loan investors was $13.9 billion . We have performed an initial review with respect to $13.4 billion of these claims and do not believe a valid basis for repurchase has been established by the claimant and are still in the process of reviewing the remaining $545 million of these claims. Certain whole-loan investors have engaged with us in a consistent repurchase process and we have used that and other experience to record a liability related to existing and future claims from such counterparties. The BNY Mellon Settlement and subsequent activity with certain counterparties led to the determination that we had sufficient experience to record a liability related to our exposure on certain private-label securitizations but did not provide sufficient experience related to certain private-label securitizations sponsored by third-party whole-loan investors. As it relates to the other private-label securitizations sponsored by third-party whole-loan investors and certain other whole loan sales, it is not possible to determine whether a loss has occurred or is probable and, therefore, no representations and warranties liability has been recorded in connection with these transactions. Until we receive a repurchase claim, we generally do not review loan files related to private-label securitizations sponsored by third-party whole-loan investors (and are not required by the governing documents to do so). Our estimated range of possible loss related to representations and warranties exposures as of June 30, 2013 included possible losses related to these whole-loan sales and private-label securitizations sponsored by third-party whole-loan investors. Private-label securitization investors generally do not have the contractual right to demand repurchase of loans directly or the right to access loan files. We have received repurchase demands totaling $1.5 billion from private-label securitization investors and a master servicer where in each case we believe the claimant has not satisfied the contractual thresholds to direct the securitization trustee to take action and/or that the demands are otherwise procedurally or substantively invalid. 64 Table of Contents Servicing, Foreclosure and Other Mortgage Matters We service a large portion of the loans we or our subsidiaries have securitized and also service loans on behalf of third-party securitization vehicles and other investors. Our servicing obligations are set forth in servicing agreements with the applicable counterparty. These obligations may include, but are not limited to, loan repurchase requirements in certain circumstances, indemnifications, payment of fees, advances for foreclosure costs that are not reimbursable, or responsibility for losses in excess of partial guarantees for VA loans. Servicing agreements with the GSEs generally provide the GSEs with broader rights relative to the servicer than are found in servicing agreements with private investors. For example, each GSE typically claims the right to demand that the servicer repurchase loans that breach the seller's representations and warranties made in connection with the initial sale of the loans even if the servicer was not the seller. The GSEs claim that they have the contractual right to demand indemnification or loan repurchase for certain servicing breaches. In addition, the GSEs' first-lien mortgage seller/servicer guides provide for timelines to resolve delinquent loans through workout efforts or liquidation, if necessary, and purport to require the imposition of compensatory fees if those deadlines are not satisfied except for reasons beyond the control of the servicer, although we believe that the governing contracts, our course of dealing, and collective past practices and understandings should inform resolution of these matters. In addition, many non-agency RMBS and whole-loan servicing agreements state that the servicer may be liable for failure to perform its servicing obligations in keeping with industry standards or for acts or omissions that involve willful malfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of, or reckless disregard of, the servicer's duties. It is not possible to reasonably estimate our liability with respect to certain potential servicing-related claims. While we have recorded certain accruals for servicing-related claims, the amount of potential liability in excess of existing accruals could be material. For additional information, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Servicing Matters and Foreclosure Processes on page 61 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 2013 IFR Acceleration Agreement On January 7, 2013, Bank of America and other mortgage servicing institutions entered into an agreement in principle with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Reserve to cease the Independent Foreclosure Review (IFR) that had commenced pursuant to consent orders entered into by Bank of America with the Federal Reserve (2011 FRB Consent Order) and by BANA with the OCC on April 13, 2011 (2011 OCC Consent Order) and replace it with an accelerated remediation process (2013 IFR Acceleration Agreement). This agreement in principle was memorialized in amendments to the 2011 FRB Consent Order and the 2011 OCC Consent Order on February 28, 2013. The 2013 IFR Acceleration Agreement requires us to provide $1.8 billion of borrower assistance in the form of loan modifications and other foreclosure prevention actions, and in addition, we made a cash payment of $1.1 billion into a qualified settlement fund in the first quarter of 2013, which was fully reserved at December 31, 2012. The borrower assistance program is not expected to result in any incremental credit provision, as we believe that the existing allowance for credit losses is adequate to absorb any costs that have not already been recorded as charge-offs. National Mortgage Settlement In March 2012, we entered into settlement agreements (collectively, the National Mortgage Settlement) with (1) the U.S. Department of Justice, various federal regulatory agencies and 49 state Attorneys General to resolve federal and state investigations into certain residential mortgage origination, servicing and foreclosure practices, (2) HUD to resolve certain claims relating to the origination of FHA-insured mortgage loans, primarily originated by Countrywide prior to and for a period following our acquisition of that lender, and (3) each of the Federal Reserve and the OCC regarding civil monetary penalties related to conduct that was the subject of consent orders entered into with the banking regulators in April 2011. The National Mortgage Settlement was entered by the court as a consent judgment on April 5, 2012. The National Mortgage Settlement provided for the establishment of certain uniform servicing standards, upfront cash payments of approximately $1.9 billion to the state and federal governments and for borrower restitution, approximately $7.6 billion in borrower assistance in the form of, among other things, credits earned for principal reduction, short sales, deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure and approximately $1.0 billion of credits earned for interest rate reduction modifications. In addition, the settlement with HUD provided for an upfront cash payment of $500 million to settle certain claims related to FHA-insured loans. We will also be obligated to provide additional cash payments of up to $850 million if we fail to earn an additional $850 million of credits stemming from incremental first-lien principal reductions and satisfy certain solicitation requirements over a three-year period. We also entered into agreements with several states under which we committed to perform certain minimum levels of principal reduction and related activities within those states in connection with the National Mortgage Settlement, and under which we could be required to make additional payments if we fail to meet such minimum levels. 65 Table of Contents Subject to confirmation by the independent monitor appointed as a result of the National Mortgage Settlement to review and certify compliance with its provisions, we believe we have substantially fulfilled all borrower assistance, rate reduction modification and principal reduction commitments and, therefore, do not expect to be required to make additional cash payments. The borrower assistance program did not result in any incremental credit losses as of the settlement date, as the existing allowance for credit losses was adequate to absorb any losses that had not already been charged-off. Under the interest rate reduction program, modifications of approximately 23,500 loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $6.2 billion have been completed as of June 30, 2013 , including approximately 3,300 modifications that were completed during the second quarter. These modifications, which are not accounted for as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs), provided for an average interest rate reduction of approximately two percent, resulting in an estimated decrease in fair value of the modified loans of approximately $720 million and a reduction in annual interest income of approximately $120 million. Under the terms of the National Mortgage Settlement, the federal and participating state governments agreed to release us from further liability for certain alleged residential mortgage origination, servicing and foreclosure deficiencies. In settling origination issues related to FHA-guaranteed loans originated on or before April 30, 2009, we received a release from further liability for all origination claims with respect to such loans if an insurance claim had been submitted to the FHA prior to January 1, 2012 and a release of multiple damages and penalties, but not single damages, if no such claim had been submitted. In addition, provided we meet our assistance and remediation commitments, the OCC agreed not to assess, and we will not be obligated to pay to the Federal Reserve, any civil monetary penalties. The National Mortgage Settlement does not cover certain claims arising out of origination, securitization (including representations made to investors with respect to MBS), criminal claims, private claims by borrowers, claims by certain states for injunctive relief or actual economic damages to borrowers related to the Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS), and claims by the GSEs (including repurchase demands), among other items. For more information on MERS, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. on page 63 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Impact of Foreclosure Delays Foreclosure delays impact our default-related servicing costs. We believe default-related servicing costs peaked in late 2012 and we anticipate that these costs will continue to decline in 2013. However, unexpected foreclosure delays in 2013 could impact the rate of decline. Default-related servicing costs include costs related to resources needed for implementing new servicing standards mandated for the industry, including as part of the National Mortgage Settlement, other operational changes and operational costs due to delayed foreclosures, and do not include mortgage-related assessments, waivers and similar costs related to foreclosure delays. Other areas of our operations are also impacted by foreclosure delays. In the six months ended June 30, 2013 , we recorded $334 million of mortgage-related assessments, waivers and similar costs related to foreclosure delays compared to $399 million for the same period in 2012. It is also possible that the delays in foreclosure sales may result in additional costs and expenses, including costs associated with the maintenance of properties or possible home price declines while foreclosures are delayed. Finally, the time to complete foreclosure sales may continue to be protracted, which may result in a greater number of nonperforming loans and increased servicing advances, and may impact the collectability of such advances and the value of our MSR asset, MBS and real estate owned properties. Accordingly, the ultimate resolution of disagreements with counterparties, delays in foreclosure sales beyond those currently anticipated, and any issues that may arise out of alleged irregularities in our foreclosure process could significantly increase the costs associated with our mortgage operations. Other Mortgage-related Matters We continue to be subject to additional borrower and non-borrower litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny related to our past and current origination, servicing, transfer of servicing and servicing rights and foreclosure activities, including those claims not covered by the National Mortgage Settlement. This scrutiny may extend beyond our pending foreclosure matters to issues arising out of alleged irregularities with respect to previously completed foreclosure activities. We are also subject to inquiries, investigations, actions and claims from regulators, trustees, investors and other third parties relating to other mortgage-related activities such as the purchase, sale, pooling, and origination and securitization of loans, as well as structuring, marketing, underwriting and issuance of MBS and other securities, including claims relating to the adequacy and accuracy of disclosures in offering documents and representations and warranties made in connection with whole-loan sales or securitizations. The current environment of heightened scrutiny may subject us to regulatory and other inquiries or investigations that could significantly adversely affect our reputation and result in material costs to us. 66 Table of Contents Mortgage-related Settlements Servicing Matters I n connection with the BNY Mellon Settlement, BANA has agreed to implement certain servicing changes. The Trustee and BANA have agreed to clarify and conform certain servicing standards related to loss mitigation. In particular, the BNY Mellon Settlement clarifies that it is permissible to apply the same loss mitigation strategies to the Covered Trusts as are applied to BANA affiliates' HFI portfolios. This portion of the agreement was effective in the second quarter of 2011 and is not conditioned on final court approval. BANA also agreed to transfer the servicing rights related to certain high-risk loans to qualified subservicers on a schedule that began with the signing of the BNY Mellon Settlement. This servicing transfer protocol will reduce the servicing fees payable to BANA in the future. Upon final court approval of the BNY Mellon Settlement, failure to meet the established benchmarking standards for loans not in subservicing arrangements can trigger the payment of agreed-upon fees. Additionally, we and Countrywide have agreed to work to resolve with the Trustee certain mortgage documentation issues related to the enforceability of mortgages in foreclosure and to reimburse the related Covered Trust for any loss if BANA is unable to foreclose on the mortgage and the Covered Trust is not made whole by a title policy because of these issues. These agreements will terminate if final court approval of the BNY Mellon Settlement is not obtained, although we could still have exposure under the pooling and servicing agreements related to the mortgages in the Covered Trusts for these issues. In connection with the National Mortgage Settlement, BANA has agreed to implement certain additional servicing changes. The uniform servicing standards established under the National Mortgage Settlement are broadly consistent with the residential mortgage servicing practices imposed by the 2011 OCC Consent Order; however, they are more prescriptive and cover a broader range of our residential mortgage servicing activities. These standards are intended to strengthen procedural safeguards and documentation requirements associated with foreclosure, bankruptcy and loss mitigation activities, as well as addressing the imposition of fees and the integrity of documentation, with a goal of ensuring greater transparency for borrowers. These uniform servicing standards also obligate us to implement compliance processes reasonably designed to provide assurance of the achievement of these objectives. Compliance with the uniform servicing standards is being assessed by a monitor based on the measurement of outcomes with respect to these objectives. Implementation of these uniform servicing standards is expected to contribute to elevated costs associated with the servicing process, but is not expected to result in material delays or dislocation in the performance of our mortgage servicing obligations, including the completion of foreclosures. For additional information, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Mortgage-related Settlements Servicing Matters on page 63 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Regulatory Matters U.K. Regulatory Framework Prior to April 1, 2013, our financial services operations in the U.K. were subject to regulation by and supervision of the Financial Services Authority (FSA). On April 1, 2013, the U.K. abolished the FSA, replacing it with two new regulators, the Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The PRA operates as a subsidiary of the Bank of England with responsibility for prudential regulation and supervision of banks, insurers and systemically significant investment firms. The FCA regulates and supervises the market conduct of all U.K. financial firms and prudentially regulates those firms not within the scope of the PRA. Our financial services operations in the U.K. are now subject to regulation and supervision by both the PRA and FCA. Financial Reform Act The Financial Reform Act, which was signed into law on July 21, 2010, enacted sweeping financial regulatory reform and has altered and will continue to alter the way in which we conduct certain businesses, increase our costs and reduce our revenues. Many aspects of the Financial Reform Act remain subject to final rulemaking which will take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the precise impact on the Corporation, our customers or the financial services industry. Derivatives Pursuant to the Financial Reform Act and subsequent Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) rulemaking, we have registered BANA and certain other subsidiaries as swap dealers with the CFTC and we may need to register additional entities as swap dealers or major swap participants as a result of the CFTC's July 2013 final cross-border guidance discussed below. Upon registration, swap dealers and major swap participants become subject to certain CFTC rules, including measures regarding clearing and exchange trading of certain derivatives, new capital and margin requirements, additional reporting, external and internal business conduct, swap documentation and portfolio compression and reconciliation requirements for derivatives. Most of these requirements, with the exception of margin, capital and exchange trading, have gone into effect, except with respect to swaps between our non-U.S. swap dealers and non-U.S. branches of BANA with certain non-U.S. counterparties. Swap dealers are now required to clear certain interest rate and index credit derivative transactions when facing all counterparty types other than corporate counterparties and third-party subaccounts and, after 67 Table of Contents September 9, 2013, will be required to clear all such interest rate and index credit derivative transactions, unless either counterparty qualifies for the end-user exception to the clearing mandate. These products will also become subject to exchange trading requirements beginning in the fourth quarter of 2013. The timing for margin implementation remains unknown. The Financial Reform Act and subsequent OCC rulemaking also require BANA to "push out" certain derivatives activity to one or more non-bank affiliates by July 2015. On July 12, 2013, the CFTC provided temporary exemptive relief from application of derivatives requirements of the Financial Reform Act for certain non-U.S. derivatives activity and adopted a final cross-border framework to apply CFTC requirements outside the U.S. Europe and various G-20 jurisdictions are also enacting their own derivatives regulation, although the overall pace of non-U.S. reform is behind that of the U.S. The ultimate impact on us of the derivatives regulations that have not yet been finalized and the time it will take us to comply with unfinalized requirements remains uncertain. Final regulations will impose additional operational and compliance costs on us, may require us to restructure certain businesses and may negatively impact our results of operations. For information regarding other significant regulatory matters, see Capital Management Regulatory Capital on page 70 , Note 11 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein, Regulatory Matters on page 64 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K , and Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation's 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Managing Risk Overview Risk is inherent in every material business activity that we undertake. Our business exposes us to strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. We must manage these risks to maximize our long-term results by ensuring the integrity of our assets and the quality of our earnings. We take a comprehensive approach to risk management. We have a defined risk framework and articulated risk appetite which was approved on January 23, 2013 by the Corporation's Board of Directors (the Board). Risk management planning is integrated with strategic, financial and customer/client planning so that goals and responsibilities are aligned across the organization. Risk is managed in a systematic manner by focusing on the Corporation as a whole as well as managing risk across the enterprise and within individual business units, products, services and transactions, and across all geographic locations. We maintain a governance structure that delineates the responsibilities for risk management activities, as well as governance and oversight of those activities. Enterprise-wide Stress Testing As a part of our core risk management practices, we conduct enterprise-wide stress tests on a periodic basis to better understand balance sheet, earnings, capital and liquidity sensitivities to certain economic and business scenarios, including economic and market conditions that are more severe than anticipated. These enterprise-wide stress tests provide illustrative hypothetical potential impacts from our risk profile on our balance sheet, earnings, capital and liquidity and serve as a key component of our capital, liquidity and risk management practices. Scenarios are selected by the Asset Liability and Market Risk Committee (ALMRC) and approved by the Chief Financial Officer and the Chief Risk Officer. Impacts to each business from each scenario are then determined and analyzed, primarily by leveraging the models and processes utilized in everyday management routines. Impacts are assessed along with potential mitigating actions that may be taken. Analysis from such stress scenarios is compiled for and reviewed through our Chief Financial Officer Risk Committee, ALMRC and the Board's Enterprise Risk Committee. For a more detailed discussion of our risk management activities, see pages 66 through 121 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 68 Table of Contents Strategic Risk Management Strategic risk is embedded in every business and is one of the major risk categories along with credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. It is the risk that results from adverse business decisions, ineffective or inappropriate business plans, or failure to respond to changes in the macroeconomic environment, such as business cycles, competitor actions, changing customer preferences, product obsolescence, technology developments and regulatory environment. We face significant strategic risk due to the changing regulatory environment and the fast-paced development of new products and technologies in the financial services industries. Our appetite for strategic risk is assessed based on the strategic plan, with strategic risks selectively and carefully considered against the backdrop of the evolving marketplace. Strategic risk is managed in the context of our overall financial condition, risk appetite, and stress results, among other considerations. The Chief Executive Officer and executive management team manage and act on significant strategic actions, such as material acquisitions or capital actions subsequent to required review and approval by the Board. For more information on our Strategic Risk Management activities, see page 70 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Capital Management The Corporation manages its capital position to maintain sufficient capital to support its business activities and maintain capital, risk and risk appetite commensurate with one another. Additionally, we seek to maintain safety and soundness at all times including under adverse conditions, take advantage of organic growth opportunities, maintain ready access to financial markets, continue to serve as a credit intermediary, remain a source of strength for our subsidiaries, and satisfy current and future regulatory capital requirements. To determine the appropriate level of capital, we assess the results of our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP), the current economic and market environment, and feedback from key stakeholders including investors, rating agencies and regulators. Based upon this analysis, we set goals for capital ratios to maintain an adequate capital position, including in severe adverse economic scenarios. The ICAAP incorporates capital forecasts, stress test results, economic capital (which is a component of allocated capital), qualitative risk assessments and assessment of regulatory changes. Throughout the year, we generate regulatory capital and economic capital forecasts that are aligned to the most recent earnings, balance sheet and risk forecasts. We utilize quarterly stress tests to assess the potential impacts to our balance sheet, earnings, capital and liquidity under a variety of stress scenarios. We perform qualitative risk assessments to identify and assess material risks not fully captured in the forecasts, stress tests or economic capital. We regularly assess the capital impacts of proposed changes to regulatory capital requirements. Management regularly assesses ICAAP results and provides documented quarterly assessments of the adequacy of the capital guidelines and capital position to the Board or its committees. Capital management is integrated into our risk and governance processes, as capital is a key consideration in the development of the strategic plan, risk appetite and risk limits. Effective January 1, 2013, on a prospective basis, we adjusted the amount of capital being allocated to our business segments. The adjustment reflects a refinement to the prior-year methodology (economic capital) which focused solely on internal risk-based economic capital models. The refined methodology (allocated capital) now also considers the effect of regulatory capital requirements in addition to internal risk-based economic capital models. The Corporation's internal risk-based capital models use a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment's credit, market, interest rate, business and operational risk components. See Managing Risk on page 68 and Strategic Risk Management on page 69 for more information on the nature of these risks. The capital allocated to the business segments is currently referred to as allocated capital and, prior to January 1, 2013, was referred to as economic capital, both of which represent non-GAAP financial measures. Allocated capital in the business segments is subject to change over time. For more information on the refined methodology, see Business Segment Operations on page 30 . 69 Table of Contents Regulatory Capital As a financial services holding company, we are subject to the general risk-based capital rules issued by federal banking regulators which was Basel 1 through December 31, 2012. On January 1, 2013, Basel 1 was amended prospectively, introducing changes to the measurement of risk-weighted assets for exposures subject to market risk (Market Risk Final Rule) and is referred to herein as the Basel 1 2013 Rules. Under these rules, the Corporation and its affiliated banking entities, BANA and FIA, measure capital adequacy based on Tier 1 common capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2 capital). Capital ratios are calculated by dividing each capital amount by risk-weighted assets. Additionally, Tier 1 capital is divided by adjusted quarterly average total assets to derive the Tier 1 leverage ratio. For more information on the Market Risk Final Rule, see Capital Management Regulatory Capital Changes on page 72 . The Federal Reserve requires BHCs to submit a capital plan and requests for capital actions on an annual basis, consistent with the rules governing the CCAR. The CCAR is the central element to the Federal Reserve's approach to ensuring that large BHCs have adequate capital and robust processes for managing their capital. In January 2013, we submitted our 2013 capital plan, and received results on March 14, 2013. The Federal Reserve's stress scenario projections for the Corporation, based on the 2013 capital plan, estimated a Basel 1 2013 minimum Tier 1 common capital ratio of 6.0 percent under severe adverse economic conditions with all proposed capital actions through the end of 2014, exceeding the five percent reference rate for all institutions involved in the CCAR. The capital plan submitted by the Corporation included a request to repurchase up to $5.0 billion of common stock over four quarters, beginning in the second quarter of 2013, the redemption of $5.5 billion in preferred stock and a continuation of the quarterly common stock dividend at $0.01 per share. The Federal Reserve did not object to our 2013 capital plan, including all proposed capital actions. As of June 30, 2013, in connection with the CCAR capital plan, we have repurchased and retired 79.6 million common shares for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.0 billion and we redeemed $5.5 billion of preferred stock consisting of Series H and 8. The timing and exact amount of common stock repurchases will be consistent with the Corporation's capital plan and will be subject to various factors, including the Corporation's capital position, liquidity, applicable legal considerations, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock trading price, and general market conditions, and may be suspended at any time. The common stock repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including Rule 10b5-1 plans. For additional information, see Capital Management Regulatory Capital on page 70 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 17 Regulatory Requirements and Restrictions to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Capital Composition and Ratios Tier 1 common capital under the Basel 1 2013 Rules was $139.5 billion at June 30, 2013 , an increase of $6.1 billion compared to $133.4 billion under Basel 1 at December 31, 2012 . For comparative purposes, we have also provided pro-forma Tier 1 common capital and the related ratio as of December 31, 2012 as if the Basel 1 2013 Rules existed at that time. At December 31, 2012 , the pro-forma Tier 1 common capital of $133.4 billion was unchanged and the difference between the pro-forma Tier 1 common capital ratio of 10.38 percent compared to 11.06 percent on an as-reported basis was the result of additional risk-weighted assets of $78.8 billion as measured under the Basel 1 2013 Rules. At June 30, 2013 , the Tier 1 common capital ratio was 10.83 percent , a 45 bps increase from the pro-forma Tier 1 common capital ratio of 10.38 percent at December 31, 2012 . The increase was due to earnings eligible to be included in capital, partially offset by the impact of the common stock repurchases and a modest increase in risk-weighted assets. During the six months ended June 30, 2013 , total capital remained relatively unchanged at $196.8 billion with increases in Tier 1 common capital and the portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses eligible to be included in capital offset by decreases in qualifying preferred stock, term subordinated debt and qualifying trust preferred securities (Trust Securities). For additional information, see Tables 17 and 18 . Risk-weighted assets increased $82.2 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2013 to $1,288 billion . This increase adversely impacted Tier 1 common, Tier 1 and Total capital ratios by 72 bps, 82 bps and 104 bps, respectively. The increase was primarily due to the net impact of the Basel 1 2013 Rules which added approximately $87 billion in risk-weighted assets and reduced the Tier 1 common capital ratio by approximately 76 bps. The Tier 1 leverage ratio increased 12 bps during the six months ended June 30, 2013 primarily driven by the increase in Tier 1 capital.

Regulatory Capital Changes At June 30, 2013 , we measured and reported our capital ratios and related information in accordance with the Basel 1 2013 Rules, which introduced new measures of market risk including a charge related to stressed Value-at-Risk (VaR), an incremental risk charge and the comprehensive risk measure (CRM), as well as other technical modifications. The implementation of the Basel 1 2013 Rules was the primary driver of the changes in total risk-weighted assets, and Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 common capital and Total capital ratios from December 31, 2012. We manage regulatory capital to adhere to internal capital guidelines and regulatory standards of capital adequacy based on our current understanding of the rules and the application of such rules to our business as currently conducted. The regulatory capital rules continue to expand and evolve. In December 2007, U.S. banking regulators published final Basel 2 rules (Basel 2). We measure and report our capital ratios and related information under Basel 2 on a confidential basis to U.S. banking regulators during the required parallel period, during which we provide the U.S. banking regulators both the Basel 1 2013 Rules and Basel 2 related information in parallel. The parallel period will continue until we receive regulatory approval to exit parallel reporting and subsequently begin publicly reporting our Basel 2 regulatory capital results and related disclosures. In July 2013, U.S. banking regulators approved the final Basel 3 rules (Basel 3). While not yet published in the Federal Register, Basel 3 will be effective January 1, 2014. Various aspects of Basel 3 will be subject to multi-year transition periods ending December 31, 2018 and Basel 3 generally continues to be subject to further evaluation and interpretation by the U.S. banking regulators. Basel 3 will materially change our Tier 1 common, Tier 1 and Total capital calculations. Basel 3 introduces new minimum capital ratios and buffer requirements, changes the composition of regulatory capital, expands and modifies the calculation of risk-weighted assets for credit and market risk (the Advanced Approach), revises the adequately capitalized minimum requirements under the Prompt Corrective Action framework and introduces, effective January 1, 2015, a Standardized Approach for the calculation of risk-weighted assets, which will replace the Basel 1 2013 Rules. Under Basel 3, we will be required to calculate regulatory capital ratios and risk-weighted assets under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is to be used to assess capital adequacy including under the Prompt Corrective Action framework. The Prompt Corrective Action framework establishes categories of capitalization, including "well-capitalized," based on regulatory ratio requirements. U.S. banking regulators are required to take certain mandatory 72 Table of Contents actions depending on the category of capitalization, with no mandatory actions required for "well-capitalized" banking entities. We continue to evaluate the impact of both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches on us. The Basel 3 Advanced Approach requires approval by the U.S. regulatory agencies of analytical models used as part of capital measurement. If these models are not approved, it would likely lead to an increase in our risk-weighted assets, which in some cases could be significant. Important differences between Basel 1, Basel 1 2013 Rules and Basel 3 include capital deductions related to our MSRs, deferred tax assets and defined benefit pension assets, and the inclusion of unrealized gains and losses on debt and equity securities recognized in accumulated OCI, each of which will be impacted by future changes in interest rates, overall earnings performance or other corporate actions. In July 2013, U.S. banking regulators also issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to modify the supplementary leverage ratio minimum requirements under Basel 3 which would be effective in 2018. This proposal would only be applicable to BHCs with more than $700 billion in total assets or more than $10 trillion in total assets under custody. If adopted, it would require the Corporation to maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of three percent, plus a supplementary leverage buffer of two percent, for a total of five percent . If the Corporation's supplementary leverage buffer is not greater than or equal to two percent , then the Corporation would be required to maintain higher capital levels which could limit its ability to make distributions of capital to shareholders, whether through dividends, stock repurchases or otherwise. In addition, the insured depository institutions of such BHCs, which for the Corporation would include primarily BANA and FIA, would be required to maintain a minimum six percent leverage ratio to be considered "well capitalized." As of June 30, 2013 , we estimate the Corporation's supplementary leverage ratio to be in the range of 4.9 percent to 5.0 percent based on these proposed requirements. As of June 30, 2013, we estimate that the supplementary leverage ratio for our primary bank subsidiaries, BANA and FIA, were both in excess of the six percent proposed minimum. The proposal is not yet final and, when finalized, could have provisions significantly different from those currently proposed. Changes to the composition of regulatory capital under Basel 3, such as recognizing the impact of unrealized gains or losses on AFS debt securities on Tier 1 common capital, are subject to a transition period where the impact is recognized in 20 percent annual increments. The transition period for these regulatory capital adjustments and deductions extends from the effective date through December 31, 2017. The phase-in period for the new minimum capital ratio requirements and related buffers under Basel 3 will occur from January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2018. When presented on a fully phased-in basis, the capital ratio, capital and risk-weighted assets assume all regulatory capital adjustments and deductions are fully recognized. In addition, Basel 3 established regulatory capital treatment for Trust Securities, which requires that Trust Securities be: (1) excluded from Tier 1 capital, but included in Tier 2 capital in 2014 and 2015; and (2) subsequently excluded from both Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital beginning in 2016. Our previously issued and outstanding Trust Securities in the aggregate qualifying amount of $5.8 billion (approximately 45 bps of Tier 1 capital) at June 30, 2013 will no longer qualify as Tier 1 capital or Tier 2 capital beginning in 2016. Under the Basel 3 Advanced Approach, we estimated our Tier 1 common capital ratio, on a fully phased-in basis, to be 9.60 percent at June 30, 2013 . As of June 30, 2013 , we estimated that our Tier 1 common capital would be $125.8 billion and total risk-weighted assets would be $1,310 billion , on a fully phased-in basis. This assumes approval by U.S. banking regulators of our internal analytical models, but does not include the benefit of the removal of the surcharge applicable to the CRM. The CRM is used to determine the risk-weighted assets for correlation trading positions. The calculations under Basel 3 require management to make estimates, assumptions and interpretations, including the probability of future events based on historical experience. Realized results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. Basel 3 regulatory capital metrics are considered non-GAAP financial measures until January 1, 2014 when they are fully adopted and required by U.S. banking regulators. We have provided these measures in accordance with the Advanced Approach for comparability to our peers. Table 19 presents a reconciliation of our Tier 1 common capital and risk-weighted assets in accordance with the Basel 1 2013 Rules to our Basel 3 estimates at June 30, 2013 and Basel 1 to Basel 3 estimates at December 31, 2012 , assuming fully phased-in measures according to the Basel 3 Advanced Approach. Our estimates under the Basel 3 Advanced Approach may be refined over time as a result of further rulemaking or clarification by U.S. banking regulators or as our understanding and interpretation of the rules evolve. For additional information, see Table 19 . In 2011, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the Basel Committee) issued proposed guidance on capital requirements for global systemically important financial institutions, including the methodology for measuring systemic importance, the additional capital required (the SIFI buffer), and the arrangements by which the guidance will be phased in (the 2011 G-SIFI Proposal). Under this proposal, the SIFI buffer would increase minimum capital requirements for Tier 1 common capital from one percent to 2.5 percent, and in certain circumstances, 3.5 percent. As of June 30, 2013 , we estimate our SIFI buffer would be 1.5 percent, in line with the Financial Stability Board's report, "Update of Group of Global Systemically Important Banks," issued on November 1, 2012 and based on the 2011 G-SIFI Proposal. Subsequently, in July 2013, the Basel Committee issued a new proposal that updates and replaces the 2011 G-SIFI Proposal. This new proposal modifies and recalibrates the assessment methodology and introduces public disclosure requirements. U.S. banking regulators have not yet issued proposed or final rules related to the SIFI buffer or disclosure requirements. 73 Table of Contents On December 20, 2011, the Federal Reserve issued proposed rules to implement enhanced supervisory and prudential requirements, and the early remediation requirements established under the Financial Reform Act. The enhanced standards include liquidity standards, requirements for overall risk management, single-counterparty credit limits, stress test requirements and a debt-to-equity limit for certain companies determined to pose a threat to financial stability. The final rules, when adopted and fully implemented, are likely to influence our regulatory capital and liquidity planning process, and may impose additional operational and compliance costs on us.

For additional information, see Capital Management Capital Composition and Ratios on page 70 . We expect to merge certain pension plans during the third quarter of 2013. The plan merger will require a remeasurement of the qualified pension obligations and plan assets at fair value as of the merger date. The remeasurement is expected to marginally benefit our Tier 1 common capital under Basel 3. The actual amount is subject to market conditions at the time of the merger and will change as markets change.

(2) Dollar amount required to meet guidelines for well-capitalized institutions. BANA's Tier 1 capital ratio decreased 14 bps to 12.30 percent and the Total capital ratio decreased 70 bps to 14.06 percent at June 30, 2013 compared to December 31, 2012 . The Tier 1 leverage ratio increased 38 bps to 8.97 percent at June 30, 2013 compared to December 31, 2012 . The decrease in the Tier 1 capital ratio was driven by an increase in risk-weighted assets of $55.4 billion compared to December 31, 2012 , returns of capital and dividends paid to the Corporation of $3.0 billion and $5.2 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 , partially offset by earnings eligible to be included in capital of $3.9 billion and $9.0 billion. The decrease in the Total capital ratio was driven by the same factors as discussed for the Tier 1 capital ratio above as well as a $2.5 billion and $4.9 billion decrease in qualifying subordinated debt for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 . The increase in the Tier 1 leverage ratio was primarily driven by an increase in Tier 1 capital. The increase in risk-weighted assets was primarily due to the impact of implementing the Basel 1 2013 Rules and an increase in loans. FIA's Tier 1 capital ratio and the Total capital ratio decreased 56 bps to 16.78 percent and 18.08 percent at June 30, 2013 compared to December 31, 2012 . The Tier 1 leverage ratio decreased 95 bps to 12.72 percent at June 30, 2013 compared to December 31, 2012 . The decrease in the Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios was driven by returns of capital of $1.8 billion and $3.9 billion to the Corporation, partially offset by earnings eligible to be included in capital of $937 million and $1.9 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 and a decrease in risk-weighted assets of $7.2 billion compared to December 31, 2012 , primarily due to a decrease in loans. The decrease in the Tier 1 leverage ratio was driven by the decrease in Tier 1 capital, partially offset by a decrease in adjusted quarterly average total assets of $3.0 billion. FIA was not impacted by the implementation of the Basel 1 2013 Rules. Broker/Dealer Regulatory Capital The Corporation's principal U.S. broker/dealer subsidiaries are Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith (MLPF&S) and Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp (MLPCC). MLPCC is a fully-guaranteed subsidiary of MLPF&S and provides clearing and settlement services. Both entities are subject to the net capital requirements of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 15c3-1. Both entities are also registered as futures commission merchants and are subject to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Regulation 1.17. MLPF&S has elected to compute the minimum capital requirement in accordance with the Alternative Net Capital Requirement as permitted by SEC Rule 15c3-1. At June 30, 2013 , MLPF&S's regulatory net capital as defined by Rule 15c3-1 was $11.6 billion and exceeded the minimum requirement of $793 million by $10.9 billion. MLPCC's net capital of $1.8 billion exceeded the minimum requirement of $242 million by $1.6 billion. In accordance with the Alternative Net Capital Requirements, MLPF&S is required to maintain tentative net capital in excess of $1.0 billion, net capital in excess of $500 million and notify the SEC in the event its tentative net capital is less than $5.0 billion. At June 30, 2013 , MLPF&S had tentative net capital and net capital in excess of the minimum and notification requirements. 75 Table of Contents Common and Preferred Stock Dividends For a summary of our declared quarterly cash dividends on common stock during the second quarter of 2013 and through August 1, 2013 , see Note 12 Shareholders' Equity to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Table 21 is a summary of our cash dividend declarations on preferred stock during the second quarter of 2013 and through August 1, 2013 .

Liquidity Risk Funding and Liquidity Risk Management We define liquidity risk as the potential inability to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations, on- or off-balance sheet, as they come due. Our primary liquidity objective is to provide adequate funding for our businesses throughout market cycles, including periods of financial stress. To achieve that objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk, maintain excess liquidity and access diverse funding sources including our stable deposit base. We define excess liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we can use to meet our funding requirements as those obligations arise. Global funding and liquidity risk management activities are centralized within Corporate Treasury. We believe that a centralized approach to funding and liquidity risk management enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding sources, minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events. For more information regarding global funding and liquidity risk management, see Liquidity Risk Funding and Liquidity Risk Management on page 75 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Global Excess Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets We maintain excess liquidity available to Bank of America Corporation, or the parent company and selected subsidiaries in the form of cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. These assets, which we call our Global Excess Liquidity Sources, serve as our primary means of liquidity risk mitigation. Our cash is primarily on deposit with the Federal Reserve and central banks outside of the U.S. We limit the composition of high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities to U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency MBS and a select group of non-U.S. government and supranational securities. We believe we can quickly obtain cash for these securities, even in stressed market conditions, through repurchase agreements or outright sales. We hold our Global Excess Liquidity Sources in entities that allow us to meet the liquidity requirements of our global businesses, and we consider the impact of potential regulatory, tax, legal and other restrictions that could limit the transferability of funds among entities. 77 Table of Contents Our Global Excess Liquidity Sources were $342 billion and $372 billion at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 and were maintained as presented in Table 22 . Table 22 Global Excess Liquidity Sources (Dollars in billions) June 30 2013 December 31 2012 Average for Three Months Ended June 30, 2013 Parent company $ 95 $ 103 $ 94 Bank subsidiaries 221 247 235 Broker/dealers 26 22 25 Total global excess liquidity sources $ 342 $ 372 $ 354 As shown in Table 22 , parent company Global Excess Liquidity Sources totaled $95 billion and $103 billion at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 . The decrease in parent company liquidity was primarily due to debt maturities and capital actions. Typically, parent company cash is deposited overnight with BANA. Global Excess Liquidity Sources available to our bank subsidiaries totaled $221 billion and $247 billion at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 . The decrease in bank subsidiaries' liquidity was primarily due to expected deposit outflows and securities revaluation. Liquidity amounts are distinct from the cash deposited by the parent company. In addition to their Global Excess Liquidity Sources, our bank subsidiaries hold other unencumbered investment-grade securities that we believe could also be used to generate liquidity. Our bank subsidiaries can also generate incremental liquidity by pledging a range of other unencumbered loans and securities to certain FHLBs and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against this pool of specifically-identified eligible assets was approximately $198 billion and $194 billion at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 . We have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against these assets, including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loans and securities collateral. Eligibility is defined by guidelines outlined by the FHLBs and the Federal Reserve and is subject to change at their discretion. Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries can only be used to fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries and can only be transferred to the parent company or nonbank subsidiaries with prior regulatory approval. Global Excess Liquidity Sources available to our broker/dealer subsidiaries totaled $26 billion and $22 billion at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 . Our broker/dealers also held other unencumbered investment-grade securities and equities that we believe could be used to generate additional liquidity. Liquidity held in a broker/dealer subsidiary is available to meet the obligations of that entity and can only be transferred to the parent company or to any other subsidiary with prior regulatory approval due to regulatory restrictions and minimum requirements. Table 23 presents the composition of Global Excess Liquidity Sources at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 . Table 23 Global Excess Liquidity Sources Composition (Dollars in billions) June 30 2013 December 31 2012 Cash on deposit $ 54 $ 65 U.S. Treasuries 12 21 U.S. agency securities and mortgage-backed securities 261 271 Non-U.S. government and supranational securities 15 15 Total global excess liquidity sources $ 342 $ 372 Time to Required Funding and Stress Modeling We use a variety of metrics to determine the appropriate amounts of excess liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our bank and broker/dealer subsidiaries. One metric we use to evaluate the appropriate level of excess liquidity at the parent company is "Time to Required Funding." This debt coverage measure indicates the number of months that the parent company can continue to meet its unsecured contractual obligations as they come due using only its Global Excess Liquidity Sources without issuing any new debt or accessing any additional liquidity sources. We define unsecured contractual obligations for purposes of this metric as maturities of senior or subordinated debt issued or guaranteed by Bank of America Corporation or Merrill Lynch. These include certain unsecured debt instruments, primarily structured liabilities, which we may be required to settle for cash prior to maturity. Our Time to Required Funding was 32 months at June 30, 2013 , which is above the Corporation's target minimum of 21 months. For purposes of calculating Time to Required Funding, 78 Table of Contents at June 30, 2013 , we have included in the amount of unsecured contractual obligations $9.6 billion, which includes the $8.6 billion liability related to the BNY Mellon Settlement and $951 million related to the August 1, 2013 redemption of the Series J Preferred Stock. The BNY Mellon Settlement is subject to final court approval and certain other conditions, and the timing of payment is not certain. We utilize liquidity stress models to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of excess liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our bank and broker/dealer subsidiaries. These models are risk sensitive and have become increasingly important in analyzing our potential contractual and contingent cash outflows beyond those outflows considered in the Time to Required Funding analysis. We evaluate the liquidity requirements under a range of scenarios with varying levels of severity and time horizons. The scenarios we consider and utilize incorporate market-wide and Corporation-specific events, including potential credit rating downgrades for the parent company and our subsidiaries, and are based on historical experience, regulatory guidance, and both expected and unexpected future events. The types of potential contractual and contingent cash outflows we consider in our scenarios may include, but are not limited to, upcoming contractual maturities of unsecured debt and reductions in new debt issuance; diminished access to secured financing markets; potential deposit withdrawals; increased draws on loan commitments, liquidity facilities and letters of credit, including Variable Rate Demand Notes; additional collateral that counterparties could call if our credit ratings were downgraded; collateral and margin requirements arising from market value changes; and potential liquidity required to maintain businesses and finance customer activities. Changes in certain market factors, including, but not limited to, credit rating downgrades, could negatively impact potential contractual and contingent outflows and the related financial instruments, and in some cases these impacts could be material to our financial results. We consider all sources of funds that we could access during each stress scenario and focus particularly on matching available sources with corresponding liquidity requirements by legal entity. We also use the stress modeling results to manage our asset-liability profile and establish limits and guidelines on certain funding sources and businesses. Basel 3 Liquidity Standards In December 2010, the Basel Committee proposed two measures of liquidity risk which are considered part of Basel 3. The first proposed liquidity measure is the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), which is calculated as the amount of a financial institution's unencumbered, high-quality, liquid assets relative to the net cash outflows the institution could encounter under a significant 30-day stress scenario. The Basel Committee announced in January 2013 that an initial minimum LCR requirement of 60 percent will be implemented in January 2015, and will thereafter increase in 10 percent annual increments through January 2019. The second proposed liquidity measure is the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), which measures the amount of longer-term, stable sources of funding employed by a financial institution relative to the liquidity profiles of the assets funded and the potential for contingent calls on funding liquidity arising from off-balance sheet commitments and obligations over a one-year period. The Basel Committee is currently reviewing the NSFR requirement and announced that it intends to implement the requirement by January 2018, following an observation period that is currently underway. We continue to monitor the development and the potential impact of these proposals, and assuming adoption by U.S. banking regulators, we expect to meet the final standards within the regulatory timelines. Diversified Funding Sources We fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits and secured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally coordinated funding strategy. We diversify our funding globally across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups. The primary benefits expected from our centralized funding strategy include greater control, reduced funding costs, wider name recognition by investors and greater flexibility to meet the variable funding requirements of subsidiaries. Where regulations, time zone differences or other business considerations make parent company funding impractical, certain other subsidiaries may issue their own debt. We fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposits, which were $1.08 trillion and $1.11 trillion at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 . Deposits are primarily generated by our CBB, GWIM and Global Banking segments. These deposits are diversified by clients, product type and geography, and the majority of our U.S. deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. We consider a substantial portion of our deposits to be a stable, low-cost and consistent source of funding. We believe this deposit funding is generally less sensitive to interest rate changes, market volatility or changes in our credit ratings than wholesale funding sources. Our lending activities may also be financed through secured borrowings, including securitizations with GSEs, the FHA and private-label investors, as well as FHLB loans. Our trading activities in broker/dealer subsidiaries are primarily funded on a secured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions. We believe funding these activities in the secured financing markets is more cost-efficient and less sensitive to changes in our credit ratings than unsecured financing. Repurchase agreements are generally short-term and often overnight. Disruptions in secured financing markets for financial institutions have occurred in prior market cycles which resulted in adverse changes in terms or significant reductions in the availability of such financing. We manage 79 Table of Contents the liquidity risks arising from secured funding by sourcing funding globally from a diverse group of counterparties, providing a range of securities collateral and pursuing longer durations, when appropriate. We issue the majority of our long-term unsecured debt at the parent company. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 , the parent company issued $3.0 billion and $16.0 billion of long-term unsecured debt, including structured liabilities of $1.7 billion and $3.2 billion. We may also issue long-term unsecured debt through BANA in a variety of maturities and currencies to achieve cost-efficient funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity profile, although there were no new issuances through BANA during the six months ended June 30, 2013 . While the cost and availability of unsecured funding may be negatively impacted by general market conditions or by matters specific to the financial services industry or the Corporation, we seek to mitigate refinancing risk by actively managing the amount of our borrowings that we anticipate will mature within any month or quarter. On July 18, 2013, we announced an "any and all" cash tender offer and a maximum cash tender offer for certain senior notes maturing in 2014. The "any and all" tender offer expired on July 31, 2013 and the aggregate consideration payable for securities accepted for purchase in this tender was $2.1 billion. The maximum tender offer will expire on August 14, 2013 and the maximum aggregate consideration available for securities accepted for purchase in this tender is $2.9 billion. In addition, we issued $2.0 billion of 4.1% notes due July 2023 and 1.5 billion of 2.5% notes due July 2020. Substantially all of this newly issued debt has been converted to floating-rate debt with derivative transactions. Table 24 presents the carrying value of aggregate annual contractual maturities of long-term debt at June 30, 2013 .

We anticipate that debt levels will decline due to maturities through 2013, reflecting our ongoing initiative to reduce our debt balances over time. We may, from time to time, purchase outstanding debt instruments in various transactions, depending on prevailing market conditions, liquidity and other factors. In addition, our broker/dealer subsidiaries may make markets in our debt instruments to provide liquidity for investors. For more information on long-term debt funding, see Note 12 Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K and for more information regarding funding and liquidity risk management, see pages 75 through 79 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 80 Table of Contents We use derivative transactions to manage the duration, interest rate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering the characteristics of the assets they are funding. For further details on our ALM activities, see Interest Rate Risk Management for Nontrading Activities on page 130 . We also diversify our unsecured funding sources by issuing various types of debt instruments including structured liabilities, which are debt obligations that pay investors returns linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these liabilities with derivative positions and/or investments in the underlying instruments, so that from a funding perspective, the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We could be required to settle certain structured liability obligations for cash or other securities prior to maturity under certain circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning purposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date. We had outstanding structured liabilities with a carrying value of $49.1 billion and $51.7 billion at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 . Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price. Contingency Planning We maintain contingency funding plans that outline our potential responses to liquidity stress events at various levels of severity. These policies and plans are based on stress scenarios and include potential funding strategies and communication and notification procedures that we would implement in the event we experienced stressed liquidity conditions. We periodically review and test the contingency funding plans to validate efficacy and assess readiness. Our U.S. bank subsidiaries can access contingency funding through the Federal Reserve Discount Window. Certain non-U.S. subsidiaries have access to central bank facilities in the jurisdictions in which they operate. While we do not rely on these sources in our liquidity modeling, we maintain the policies, procedures and governance processes that would enable us to access these sources if necessary. Credit Ratings Our borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are impacted by our credit ratings. In addition, credit ratings may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions, including over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. Thus, it is our objective to maintain high-quality credit ratings. Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating agencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other securities, including asset securitizations. Our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies which consider a number of factors, including our own financial strength, performance, prospects and operations as well as factors not under our control. The rating agencies could make adjustments to our ratings at any time and they provide no assurances that they will maintain our ratings at current levels. Other factors that influence our credit ratings include changes to the rating agencies' methodologies for our industry or certain security types, the rating agencies' assessment of the general operating environment for financial services companies, our mortgage exposures (including litigation), our relative positions in the markets in which we compete, reputation, liquidity position, diversity of funding sources, funding costs, the level and volatility of earnings, corporate governance and risk management policies, capital position, capital management practices, and current or future regulatory and legislative initiatives. The major rating agencies have each indicated that, as a systemically important financial institution, our credit ratings currently reflect their expectation that, if necessary, we would receive significant support from the U.S. government, and that they will continue to assess such support in the context of sovereign financial strength and regulatory and legislative developments. On June 11, 2013, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (S&P) published a report that affirmed all its current ratings for Bank of America Corporation and seven other BHCs that the agency views as having high systemic importance. That report also indicated that S&P is reconsidering, and may remove, the uplift for government support in its holding company ratings for those companies. As a result, the agency maintained its negative outlook on the Corporation's holding company ratings. S&P also maintained its negative outlook on the Corporation's operating company ratings, citing company-specific factors. On May 16, 2013, Fitch Ratings (Fitch) announced the results of its periodic review of its ratings for 12 large, complex securities trading and universal banks, including Bank of America Corporation. As part of this action, Fitch affirmed the Corporation's senior credit ratings and upgraded the rating of its stand-alone creditworthiness, as well as the ratings for its subordinated debt, trust preferred and preferred stock issuances, each by one notch. On March 27, 2013, Moody's Investor Service, Inc. (Moody's) published an update on systemic support in U.S. bank ratings and indicated 81 Table of Contents the agency expects to resolve the current negative outlooks on its ratings for systemically important U.S. BHCs, including that of the Corporation, during 2013. Currently, the Corporation's long-term/short-term senior debt ratings and outlooks expressed by the rating agencies are as follows: Baa2/P-2 (negative) by Moody's, A-/A-2 (negative) by S&P, and A/F1 (stable) by Fitch. BANA's long-term/short-term senior debt ratings and outlooks are as follows: A3/P-2 (stable) by Moody's, A/A-1 (negative) by S&P, and A/F1 (stable) by Fitch. The credit ratings of Merrill Lynch from the three major credit rating agencies are the same as those of the Corporation. The major credit rating agencies have indicated that the primary drivers of Merrill Lynch's credit ratings are the Corporation's credit ratings. MLPF&S's long-term/short-term senior debt ratings and outlooks are A/A-1 (negative) by S&P and A/F1 (stable) by Fitch. Merrill Lynch International's long-term/short-term senior debt rating is A/A-1 (negative) by S&P. A reduction in certain of our credit ratings or the ratings of certain asset-backed securitizations may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, potential loss of access to credit markets, the related cost of funds, our businesses and on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where counterparty creditworthiness is critical. In addition, under the terms of certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements, in the event of downgrades of our or our rated subsidiaries' credit ratings, the counterparties to those agreements may require us to provide additional collateral, or to terminate these contracts or agreements, which could cause us to sustain losses and/or adversely impact our liquidity. If the short-term credit ratings of our parent company, bank or broker/dealer subsidiaries were downgraded by one or more levels, the potential loss of access to short-term funding sources such as repo financing and the effect on our incremental cost of funds could be material. At June 30, 2013 , if the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for the Corporation or certain subsidiaries by one incremental notch, the amount of additional collateral contractually required by derivative contracts and other trading agreements would have been approximately $3.0 billion , comprised of $2.6 billion for BANA and $0.4 billion for Merrill Lynch and certain of its subsidiaries. If the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for these entities by a second incremental notch, approximately $5.4 billion in additional incremental collateral, comprised of $1.3 billion for BANA and $4.1 billion for Merrill Lynch and certain of its subsidiaries, would have been required. Also, if the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for the Corporation or certain subsidiaries by one incremental notch, the derivative liability that would be subject to unilateral termination by counterparties as of June 30, 2013 was $2.7 billion , against which $2.1 billion of collateral has been posted. If the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for the Corporation and certain subsidiaries by a second incremental notch, the derivative liability that would be subject to unilateral termination by counterparties as of June 30, 2013 was an incremental $1.8 billion , against which $1.2 billion of collateral has been posted. While certain potential impacts are contractual and quantifiable, the full scope of consequences of a credit ratings downgrade to a financial institution is inherently uncertain, as it depends upon numerous dynamic, complex and inter-related factors and assumptions, including whether any downgrade of a firm's long-term credit ratings precipitates downgrades to its short-term credit ratings, and assumptions about the potential behaviors of various customers, investors and counterparties. For more information on potential impacts of credit rating downgrades, see Liquidity Risk Time to Required Funding and Stress Modeling on page 78 . For information regarding the additional collateral and termination payments that could be required in connection with certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements as a result of such a credit rating downgrade, see Note 3 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation's 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K . On July 18, 2013, Moody's revised its outlook on the U.S. government to stable from negative and affirmed its Aaa long-term sovereign credit rating on the U.S. government. On June 28, 2013, Fitch affirmed its AAA long-term and F1+ short-term sovereign credit rating on the U.S. government, but the outlook remains negative. On June 10, 2013, S&P affirmed its AA+ long-term and A-1+ short-term sovereign credit rating on the U.S. government, as the outlook on the long-term credit rating was revised to stable from negative. 82 Table of Contents Credit Risk Management Credit quality continued to improve during the second quarter of 2013 due in part to improving economic conditions. In addition, our proactive credit risk management activities positively impacted the credit portfolio as charge-offs and delinquencies continued to improve, primarily in the consumer portfolios and risk ratings improved in the commercial portfolios. For additional information, see Executive Summary Second Quarter 2013 Economic and Business Environment on page 6 . We proactively refine our underwriting and credit management practices as well as credit standards to meet the changing economic environment. To actively mitigate losses and enhance customer support in our consumer businesses, we have in place collection programs and loan modification and customer assistance infrastructures. We utilize a number of actions to mitigate losses in the commercial businesses including increasing the frequency and intensity of portfolio monitoring, hedging activity and our practice of transferring management of deteriorating commercial exposures to independent special asset officers as credits enter criticized categories. Certain European countries, including Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, have experienced varying degrees of financial stress. For more information on our exposures and related risks in non-U.S. countries, see Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 116 and Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation's 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K .

Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Credit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower's credit cycle. Statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio management including underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting credit limits, and establishing operating processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns. Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources such as credit bureaus and/or internal historical experience. These models are a component of our consumer credit risk management process and are used in part to help make both new and ongoing credit decisions, as well as portfolio management strategies, including authorizations and line management, collection practices and strategies, determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses, and allocated capital for credit risk. Since January 2008, and through the second quarter of 2013 , Bank of America and Countrywide have completed approximately 1.3 million loan modifications with customers. During the second quarter of 2013 , we completed more than 38,000 customer loan modifications with a total unpaid principal balance of approximately $8 billion, including approximately 8,300 permanent modifications under the government's Making Home Affordable Program. Of the loan modifications completed during the second quarter of 2013 , in terms of both the volume of modifications and the unpaid principal balance associated with the underlying loans, most were in the portfolio serviced for investors and were not on our balance sheet. The most common types of modifications include a combination of rate reduction and/or capitalization of past due amounts which represented 63 percent of the volume of modifications completed during the second quarter of 2013 , while principal reductions and forgiveness represented 14 percent, principal forbearance represented 12 percent and capitalization of past due amounts represented six percent. For modified loans on our balance sheet, these modification types are generally considered TDRs. For more information on TDRs and portfolio impacts, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Nonperforming Consumer Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity on page 101 and Note 5 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements . 83 Table of Contents Consumer Credit Portfolio Improvement in the U.S. economy, labor markets and home prices during 2012 and through the six months ended June 30, 2013 resulted in lower credit losses across all major consumer portfolios compared to the six months ended June 30, 2012 . Although home prices have shown steady improvement over the past year and a half, it was not enough to offset the adverse impact in the home loans portfolio since 2006. Improved credit quality across the consumer portfolio drove a $3.0 billion decrease during the six months ended June 30, 2013 in the consumer allowance for loan and lease losses. For additional information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 120 . In January 2013, we entered into the FNMA Settlement to resolve substantially all outstanding and potential repurchase and certain other claims relating to the origination, sale and delivery of residential mortgage loans originated and sold directly to FNMA from January 1, 2000 through December 31, 2008 by entities related to Countrywide and BANA. In connection with the FNMA Settlement, we repurchased certain loans from FNMA and, as of June 30, 2013 , these loans had an unpaid principal balance of $6.1 billion and a carrying value of $5.1 billion of which $5.7 billion of unpaid principal balance and $4.8 billion of carrying value were classified as PCI loans. All of these loans are included in the Legacy Assets & Servicing portfolio in Table 29 . For more information on PCI loans, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio on page 95 and Note 5 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements .

In addition to being included in the "Outstandings" columns in Table 26 , PCI loans are also shown separately, net of purchase accounting adjustments, in the "Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio" columns. For additional information, see Note 5 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements . The impact of the PCI loan portfolio on certain credit statistics is reported where appropriate. For additional information, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio on page 95 . In addition, given the continued run-off of our discontinued real estate portfolio, effective January 1, 2013, the pay option loans previously included in discontinued real estate loans are now included as part of our residential mortgage and home equity portfolios. The majority of these loans were considered credit-impaired and were written down to fair value upon acquisition. Prior periods were reclassified to conform to current period presentation.

Nonperforming loans do not include past due consumer credit card loans, other unsecured loans and in general, consumer non-real estate-secured loans (excluding those loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy) as these loans are typically charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due. Real estate-secured past due consumer loans that are insured by the FHA or individually insured under long-term stand-by agreements with FNMA and FHLMC (collectively, the fully-insured loan portfolio) are reported as accruing as opposed to nonperforming since the principal repayment is insured. Fully-insured loans included in accruing past due 90 days or more are primarily from our repurchases of delinquent FHA loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA. Additionally, nonperforming loans and accruing balances past due 90 days or more do not include the PCI loan portfolio or loans accounted for under the fair value option even though the customer may be contractually past due.

(2) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as annualized net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option. Net charge-off ratios, excluding the PCI and fully-insured loan portfolios, were 0.74 percent and 0.90 percent for residential mortgage, 2.07 percent and 2.46 percent for home equity, and 1.81 percent and 1.99 percent for the total consumer portfolio for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 , respectively. Net charge-off ratios, excluding the PCI and fully-insured loan portfolios, were 1.97 percent and 2.15 percent for residential mortgage, 3.32 percent and 3.40 percent for home equity, and 2.86 percent and 3.00 percent for the total consumer portfolio for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012 , respectively. These are the only product classifications that include PCI and fully-insured loans for these periods. Net charge-offs exclude write-offs in the PCI loan portfolios of $110 million and $855 million in home equity and $203 million and $297 million in residential mortgage for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 , respectively. This compared to none for the same periods in 2012 . These write-offs decreased the PCI valuation allowance included as part of the allowance for loan and lease losses. Net charge-off ratios including the PCI write-offs were 2.35 percent and 3.93 percent for home equity and 0.74 percent and 0.75 percent for residential mortgage for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 , respectively.

Write-offs in the PCI loan portfolio decrease the PCI valuation allowance included as part of the allowance for loan and lease losses. For more information on PCI write-offs, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio on page 95 . (2) Outstandings and nonperforming amounts exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. There were $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion of residential mortgage loans accounted for under the fair value option at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 . See Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Consumer Loans Accounted for Under the Fair Value Option on page 100 and Note 17 Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the fair value option. 88 Table of Contents We believe that the presentation of information adjusted to exclude the impact of the PCI loan portfolio, the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option is more representative of the ongoing operations and credit quality of the business. As a result, in the following discussions of the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios, we provide information that excludes the impact of the PCI loan portfolio, the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option in certain credit quality statistics. We separately disclose information on the PCI loan portfolio on page 95 . Residential Mortgage The residential mortgage portfolio makes up the largest percentage of our consumer loan portfolio at 47 percent of consumer loans at June 30, 2013 . Approximately 17 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio is in GWIM and represents residential mortgages that are originated for the home purchase and refinancing needs of our wealth management clients. The remaining portion of the portfolio is primarily in All Other and is comprised of originated loans, purchased loans used in our overall ALM activities, loans repurchased in connection with the FNMA Settlement, delinquent FHA loans repurchased pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA as well as loans repurchased related to our representations and warranties. Outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio, excluding $1.1 billion of loans accounted for under the fair value option, increased $1.0 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2013 as new origination volume retained on our balance sheet and loans repurchased as part of the FNMA Settlement were partially offset by paydowns and charge-offs. At June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 , the residential mortgage portfolio included $89.3 billion and $90.9 billion of outstanding fully-insured loans. On this portion of the residential mortgage portfolio, we are protected against principal loss as a result of either FHA insurance or long-term stand-by agreements with FNMA and FHLMC. At June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 , $63.8 billion and $66.6 billion had FHA insurance with the remainder protected by long-term stand-by agreements. All of these loans are individually insured and therefore the Corporation does not record a significant allowance for credit losses with respect to these loans. At June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 , $25.4 billion and $25.5 billion of the FHA-insured loan population were repurchases of delinquent FHA loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA. In addition to the long-term stand-by agreements with FNMA and FHLMC, we have mitigated a portion of our credit risk on the residential mortgage portfolio through the use of synthetic securitization vehicles as described in Note 5 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements . At June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 , the synthetic securitization vehicles referenced principal balances of $14.8 billion and $17.6 billion of residential mortgage loans and provided loss protection up to $420 million and $500 million . At June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 , the Corporation had a receivable of $230 million and $305 million from these vehicles for reimbursement of losses. The Corporation records an allowance for credit losses on loans referenced by the synthetic securitization vehicles. The reported net charge-offs for the residential mortgage portfolio do not include the benefit of amounts reimbursable from these vehicles. Adjusting for the benefit of the credit protection from the synthetic securitizations, the residential mortgage net charge-off ratio, excluding the PCI and fully-insured loan portfolios, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 would have been reduced by four bps for both periods compared to nine bps and eight bps for the same periods in 2012 . The long-term stand-by agreements with FNMA and FHLMC and to a lesser extent the synthetic securitizations together reduce our regulatory risk-weighted assets due to the transfer of a portion of our credit risk to unaffiliated parties. At June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 , these programs had the cumulative effect of reducing our risk-weighted assets by $7.5 billion and $7.2 billion, and increasing our Tier 1 capital ratio by seven bps and eight bps, and our Tier 1 common capital ratio by six bps and seven bps. 89 Table of Contents Table 30 presents certain residential mortgage key credit statistics on both a reported basis excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, and excluding the PCI loan portfolio, fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option. Additionally, in the table below (in the "Reported Basis" columns) accruing balances past due and nonperforming loans do not include the PCI loan portfolio even though the customer may be contractually past due. We believe the presentation of information adjusted to exclude these loan portfolios is more representative of the credit risk in the residential mortgage loan portfolio. As such, the following discussion presents the residential mortgage portfolio excluding the PCI loan portfolio, the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option. For more information on the PCI loan portfolio, see page 95 .

There were $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion of residential mortgage loans accounted for under the fair value option at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 . See Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Consumer Loans Accounted for Under the Fair Value Option on page 100 and Note 17 Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the fair value option. (2) These vintages of loans account for 59 percent and 61 percent of nonperforming residential mortgage loans at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 , and 67 percent and 66 percent of residential mortgage net charge-offs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 and 72 percent for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2012 . (3) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as annualized net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option. Nonperforming residential mortgage loans decreased $739 million during the six months ended June 30, 2013 as paydowns, returns to performing status, charge-offs, transfers to foreclosed property and the impact of sales outpaced new inflows. At June 30, 2013 , borrowers were current on contractual payments with respect to $4.3 billion, or 30 percent of nonperforming residential mortgage loans, and $7.6 billion, or 53 percent of nonperforming residential mortgage loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral less costs to sell. Accruing loans past due 30 days or more decreased $564 million during the six months ended June 30, 2013 . Net charge-offs decreased $478 million to $271 million for the three months ended June 30, 2013 , or 0.74 percent of total average residential mortgage loans, compared to $749 million , or 1.97 percent for the same period in 2012 . Net charge-offs decreased $1.0 billion to $654 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013 , or 0.90 percent of total average residential mortgage loans, compared to $1.7 billion , or 2.15 percent for the same period in 2012 . These decreases in net charge-offs for the three- and six-month periods were primarily driven by favorable portfolio trends and decreased write-downs on loans greater than 180 days past due which were written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral less costs to sell, due in part to improvement in home prices and the U.S. economy. Net charge-off ratios were also impacted by lower loan balances primarily due to paydowns and charge-offs outpacing new originations. 90 Table of Contents Loans in the residential mortgage portfolio with certain characteristics have greater risk of loss than others. These characteristics include loans with a high refreshed loan-to-value (LTV), loans originated at the peak of home prices in 2006 and 2007, interest-only loans and loans to borrowers located in California and Florida where we have concentrations and where significant declines in home prices have been experienced. Although the disclosures in this section address each of these risk characteristics separately, there is significant overlap in loans with these characteristics, which contributed to a disproportionate share of the losses in the portfolio. The residential mortgage loans with all of these higher risk characteristics comprised three and four percent of the residential mortgage portfolio at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 , and accounted for 12 percent and 16 percent of the residential mortgage net charge-offs during the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to 20 percent and 21 percent for the same periods in 2012 . Residential mortgage loans with a greater than 90 percent but less than or equal to 100 percent refreshed LTV represented nine percent and 10 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 . Loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent represented 14 percent and 20 percent of the residential mortgage loan portfolio at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 . Of the loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent, 93 percent and 92 percent were performing at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 . Loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent reflect loans where the outstanding carrying value of the loan is greater than the most recent valuation of the property securing the loan. The majority of these loans have a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent primarily due to home price deterioration since 2006. Loans to borrowers with refreshed FICO scores below 620 represented 13 percent and 14 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 . Of the $143.5 billion and $144.6 billion in total residential mortgage loans outstanding at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 , as shown in Table 31 , 40 percent were originated as interest-only loans for both periods. The outstanding balance of interest-only residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period was $15.8 billion, or 27 percent at June 30, 2013 . Residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period generally have experienced a higher rate of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status compared to the residential mortgage portfolio as a whole. At June 30, 2013 , $349 million, or two percent of outstanding interest-only residential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $2.6 billion, or two percent of accruing past due 30 days or more for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, at June 30, 2013 , $2.4 billion, or 15 percent of outstanding interest-only residential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming compared to $14.3 billion, or 10 percent of nonperforming loans for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. Loans in our interest-only residential mortgage portfolio have an interest-only period of three to ten years and more than 90 percent of these loans will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2015 or later. 91 Table of Contents Table 31 presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the residential mortgage portfolio. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) within California represented 12 percent of outstandings at both June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 . Loans within this MSA comprised only six percent charge-offs for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 and eight percent of net charge-offs for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2012 .

There were $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion of residential mortgage loans accounted for under the fair value option at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 . See Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Consumer Loans Accounted for Under the Fair Value Option on page 100 and Note 17 Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the fair value option. (2) Net charge-offs exclude $203 million and $297 million of write-offs in the residential mortgage PCI loan portfolio for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to none for the same periods in 2012 . These write-offs decreased the PCI valuation allowance included as part of the allowance for loan and lease losses. For more information on PCI write-offs, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio on page 95 . (3) In these states, foreclosure requires a court order following a legal proceeding (judicial states). (4) Amount excludes the PCI residential mortgage and fully-insured loan portfolios. The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) encourages banks to meet the credit needs of their communities for housing and other purposes, particularly in neighborhoods with low or moderate incomes. At June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 , our CRA portfolio was $11.1 billion and $11.3 billion, or eight percent of the residential mortgage loan balances for both periods. The CRA portfolio included $2.2 billion and $2.5 billion of nonperforming loans at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 representing 16 percent of total nonperforming residential mortgage loans for both periods. Net charge-offs related to the CRA portfolio were $56 million and $134 million for the three months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 , or 21 percent and 18 percent of total net charge-offs for the residential mortgage portfolio. Net charge-offs related to the CRA portfolio were $148 million and $320 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 , or 23 percent and 20 percent of total net charge-offs for the residential mortgage portfolio. Home Equity The home equity portfolio makes up 18 percent of the consumer portfolio and is comprised of HELOCs, home equity loans and reverse mortgages. At June 30, 2013 , our HELOC portfolio had an outstanding balance of $85.0 billion, or 85 percent of the total home equity portfolio. HELOCs generally have an initial draw period of 10 years with approximately eight percent of the portfolio having a draw period of five years with a five-year renewal option. During the initial draw period, the borrowers are only required to pay the interest due on the loans on a monthly basis. After the initial draw period ends, the loans generally convert to 15-year amortizing loans. At June 30, 2013 , our home equity loan portfolio had an outstanding balance of $13.5 billion, or 14 percent of the total home equity portfolio. Home equity loans are almost all fixed-rate loans with amortizing payment terms of 10 to 30 years and 51 percent of these loans have 25- to 30-year terms. At June 30, 2013 , our reverse mortgage portfolio had an outstanding balance of $1.5 billion, or one percent of the total home equity portfolio. We no longer originate these products. 92 Table of Contents At June 30, 2013 , approximately 86 percent of the home equity portfolio was included in CRES while the remainder of the portfolio was primarily in GWIM . Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased $8.1 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2013 primarily due to paydowns and charge-offs outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines. Of the total home equity portfolio at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 , $23.9 billion and $24.7 billion, or 24 percent and 23 percent were in first-lien positions (26 percent and 25 percent excluding the PCI home equity portfolio at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 ). At June 30, 2013 , outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio that were in a second-lien or more junior-lien position and where we also held the first-lien loan totaled $23.4 billion, or 25 percent of our total home equity portfolio excluding the PCI loan portfolio. Unused HELOCs totaled $58.4 billion at June 30, 2013 compared to $60.9 billion at December 31, 2012 . This decrease was primarily due to customers choosing to close accounts as well as line management initiatives on deteriorating accounts, which more than offset new production. The HELOC utilization rate was 59 percent at June 30, 2013 compared to 60 percent at December 31, 2012 . Table 32 presents certain home equity portfolio key credit statistics on both a reported basis as well as excluding the PCI loan portfolio. Additionally, in the table below (in the "Reported Basis" columns) accruing balances past due 30 days or more and nonperforming loans do not include the PCI loan portfolio even though the customer may be contractually past due. We believe the presentation of information adjusted to exclude the impact of the PCI loan portfolio is more representative of the credit risk in this portfolio.

(2) These vintages of loans have higher refreshed combined LTV ratios and accounted for 51 percent of nonperforming home equity loans at both June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 , and accounted for 63 percent and 61 percent of net charge-offs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 and 64 percent for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2012 . (3) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as annualized net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans. The following discussion presents the home equity portfolio excluding the PCI loan portfolio. Nonperforming outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased $131 million during the six months ended June 30, 2013 due to charge-offs and returns to performing status outpacing new inflows. At June 30, 2013 , on $2.0 billion, or 49 percent of nonperforming home equity loans, the borrowers were current on contractual payments and $1.3 billion, or 32 percent of nonperforming home equity loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral less costs to sell. Outstanding balances accruing past due 30 days or more decreased $251 million during the six months ended June 30, 2013 . 93 Table of Contents In some cases, the junior-lien home equity outstanding balance that we hold is performing, but the underlying first-lien is not. For outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio on which we service the first-lien loan, we are able to track whether the first-lien loan is in default. For loans where the first-lien is serviced by a third party, we utilize credit bureau data to estimate the delinquency status of the first-lien. Given that the credit bureau database we use does not include a property address for the mortgages, we are unable to identify with certainty whether a reported delinquent first-lien mortgage pertains to the same property for which we hold a junior-lien loan. At June 30, 2013 , we estimate that $2.3 billion of current and $369 million of 30 to 89 days past due junior-lien loans were behind a delinquent first-lien loan. We service the first-lien loans on $615 million of these combined amounts, with the remaining $2.0 billion serviced by third parties. Of the $2.6 billion of current to 89 days past due junior-lien loans, based on available credit bureau data and our own internal servicing data, we estimate that approximately $1.3 billion had first-lien loans that were 90 days or more past due. Net charge-offs decreased $407 million to $486 million , or 2.07 percent of the total average home equity portfolio, for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $893 million , or 3.32 percent for the same period in 2012 . Net charge-offs decreased $681 million to $1.2 billion , or 2.46 percent of the total average home equity portfolio, for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $1.9 billion , or 3.40 percent for the same period in 2012 . These decreases in net charge-offs for the three- and six-month periods were primarily driven by favorable portfolio trends due in part to improvement in home prices and the U.S. economy. Net charge-off ratios were also impacted by lower outstanding balances primarily as a result of paydowns and charge-offs outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines. There are certain characteristics of the home equity portfolio that have contributed to higher losses including those loans with a high refreshed combined loan-to-value (CLTV), loans that were originated at the peak of home prices in 2006 and 2007, and loans in geographic areas that have experienced the most significant declines in home prices. Home price declines since 2006 coupled with the fact that most home equity outstandings are secured by second-lien positions have significantly reduced and, in some cases, eliminated all collateral value after consideration of the first-lien position. Although the disclosures in this section address each of these risk characteristics separately, there is significant overlap in outstanding balances with these characteristics, which has contributed to a disproportionate share of losses in the portfolio. Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio with all of these higher risk characteristics comprised seven percent and eight percent of the total home equity portfolio at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 , and accounted for 22 percent and 20 percent of the home equity net charge-offs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to 22 percent and 24 percent for the same periods in 2012 . Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio with greater than 90 percent but less than or equal to 100 percent refreshed CLTVs comprised 10 percent of the home equity portfolio at both June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 . Outstanding balances with refreshed CLTVs greater than 100 percent comprised 25 percent and 29 percent of the home equity portfolio at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 . Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent reflect loans where the carrying value and available line of credit of the combined loans are equal to or greater than the most recent valuation of the property securing the loan. Depending on the value of the property, there may be collateral in excess of the first-lien that is available to reduce the severity of loss on the second-lien. Home price deterioration since 2006 has contributed to an increase in CLTV ratios. Of those outstanding balances with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent, 96 percent of the customers were current on their home equity loan and 92 percent of second-lien loans with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent were current on both their second-lien and underlying first-lien loans at June 30, 2013 . Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio to borrowers with a refreshed FICO score below 620 represented eight percent of the home equity portfolio at both June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 . Of the $92.6 billion and $99.5 billion in total home equity portfolio outstandings at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 , 80 percent and 79 percent were interest-only loans, almost all of which were HELOCs. The outstanding balance of HELOCs that have entered the amortization period was $2.3 billion, or three percent of total HELOCs at June 30, 2013 . The HELOCs that have entered the amortization period have experienced a higher percentage of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status when compared to the HELOC portfolio as a whole. At June 30, 2013 , $76 million, or three percent of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $757 million, or one percent of outstanding accruing past due 30 days or more for the entire HELOC portfolio. In addition, at June 30, 2013 , $168 million, or seven percent of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming compared to $3.6 billion, or four percent of outstandings that were nonperforming for the entire HELOC portfolio. Loans in our HELOC portfolio generally have an initial draw period of 10 years and more than 85 percent of these loans will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2015 or later. Although we do not actively track how many of our home equity customers pay only the minimum amount due on their home equity loans and lines, we can infer some of this information through a review of our HELOC portfolio that we service and that is still in its revolving period (i.e., customers may draw on and repay their line of credit, but are generally only required to pay interest on a monthly basis). During the three months ended June 30, 2013 , approximately 63 percent of these customers did not pay any principal on their HELOCs. 94 Table of Contents Table 33 presents outstandings, nonperforming balances and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the home equity portfolio. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 11 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 . This MSA comprised nine percent of net charge-offs for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 and seven percent and eight percent of net charge-offs for the same periods in 2012 . The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California made up 12 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 . This MSA comprised nine percent of net charge-offs for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 and nine percent and 11 percent for the same periods in 2012 .

These write-offs decreased the PCI valuation allowance included as part of the allowance for loan and lease losses. For more information on PCI write-offs, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio on page 95 . (2) In these states, foreclosure requires a court order following a legal proceeding (judicial states). (3) Amount excludes the PCI home equity portfolio. Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio Loans acquired with evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination and for which it is probable at purchase that we will be unable to collect all contractually required payments are accounted for under the accounting guidance for PCI loans, which addresses accounting for differences between contractual and expected cash flows to be collected from the purchaser's initial investment in loans if those differences are attributable, at least in part, to credit quality. Evidence of credit quality deterioration as of the acquisition date may include statistics such as past due status, refreshed FICO scores and refreshed LTVs. PCI loans are recorded at fair value upon acquisition and the applicable accounting guidance prohibits carrying over or recording a valuation allowance in the initial accounting. PCI loans that have similar risk characteristics, primarily credit risk, collateral type and interest rate risk, are pooled and accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows. Once a pool is assembled, it is treated as if it were one loan for purposes of applying the accounting guidance for PCI loans. An individual loan is removed from a PCI loan pool if it is sold, foreclosed, forgiven or the expectation of any future proceeds is remote. When a loan is removed from a PCI loan pool and the foreclosure or recovery value of the loan is less than the loan's carrying value, the difference is first applied against the PCI pool's nonaccretable difference. If the nonaccretable difference has been fully utilized, only then is the PCI pool's basis applicable to that loan written-off against its valuation reserve; however, the integrity of the pool is maintained and it continues to be accounted for as if it were one loan. In January 2013, in connection with the FNMA Settlement, we repurchased certain residential mortgage loans that had previously been sold to FNMA, which we have valued at less than the purchase price. As of June 30, 2013 , loans repurchased in connection with the FNMA Settlement that we classified as PCI had an unpaid principal balance of $5.7 billion and a carrying value of $4.8 billion . For additional information, see Note 8 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements . 95 Table of Contents Table 34 presents the unpaid principal balance, carrying value, related valuation allowance and the net carrying value as a percentage of the unpaid principal balance for the PCI loan portfolio.

Excluding the $5.7 billion of loans repurchased, the total PCI unpaid principal balance decreased $2.7 billion primarily driven by liquidations, payoffs, paydowns and write-offs. Of the unpaid principal balance of $29.6 billion at June 30, 2013 , $7.2 billion was 180 days or more past due, including $7.0 billion of first-lien and $236 million of home equity loans. Of the $22.4 billion that was less than 180 days past due, $19.1 billion, or 86 percent of the total unpaid principal balance, was current based on the contractual terms while $2.1 billion, or 10 percent, was in early stage delinquency. During the three months ended June 30, 2013 , we recorded a provision benefit of $252 million for the PCI loan portfolio including a provision benefit of $205 million for residential mortgage and a benefit of $47 million for home equity. This compared to a total provision expense of $6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2012 . During the six months ended June 30, 2013 , we recorded a provision benefit of $459 million for the PCI loan portfolio including a provision benefit of $396 million for residential mortgage and a benefit of $63 million for home equity. This compared to a total provision expense of $493 million for the six months ended June 30, 2012 . The provision benefit for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 was primarily driven by an improvement in our home price outlook. The PCI valuation allowance declined $1.6 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2013 due to $855 million and $297 million of write-offs in the home equity and residential mortgage PCI loan portfolios, and a provision benefit of $459 million for the PCI loan portfolio. Write-offs during the six months ended June 30, 2013 included certain home equity PCI loans that were ineligible for the National Mortgage Settlement, but had similar characteristics as the eligible loans and the expectations of future cash proceeds was considered remote. Additional information on the PCI residential mortgage and home equity portfolios is provided in the following sections. 96 Table of Contents Purchased Credit-impaired Residential Mortgage Loan Portfolio The PCI residential mortgage loan portfolio comprised 74 percent of the total PCI loan portfolio at June 30, 2013 . Those loans to borrowers with a refreshed FICO score below 620 represented 56 percent of the PCI residential mortgage loan portfolio at June 30, 2013 . Loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 90 percent, after consideration of purchase accounting adjustments and the related valuation allowance, represented 45 percent of the PCI residential mortgage loan portfolio and 64 percent based on the unpaid principal balance at June 30, 2013 . Table 35 presents outstandings net of purchase accounting adjustments and before the related valuation allowance, by certain state concentrations. Table 35 Outstanding Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio Residential Mortgage State Concentrations (Dollars in millions) June 30 2013 December 31 2012 California $ 9,441 $ 9,238 Florida (1) 2,019 1,797 Virginia 825 715 Maryland 803 417 Texas 476 192 Other U.S./Non-U.S. 7,660 5,092 Total $ 21,224 $ 17,451 (1) In this state, foreclosure requires a court order following a legal proceeding (judicial state). Pay option adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which are included in the residential mortgage portfolio, have interest rates that adjust monthly and minimum required payments that adjust annually, subject to resetting if minimum payments are made and deferred interest limits are reached. Annual payment adjustments are subject to a 7.5 percent maximum change. To ensure that contractual loan payments are adequate to repay a loan, the fully-amortizing loan payment amount is re-established after the initial five- or ten-year period and again every five years thereafter. These payment adjustments are not subject to the 7.5 percent limit and may be substantial due to changes in interest rates and the addition of unpaid interest to the loan balance. Payment advantage ARMs have interest rates that are fixed for an initial period of five years. Payments are subject to reset if the minimum payments are made and deferred interest limits are reached. If interest deferrals cause a loan's principal balance to reach a certain level within the first 10 years of the life of the loan, the payment is reset to the interest-only payment; then at the 10-year point, the fully-amortizing payment is required. The difference between the frequency of changes in a loan's interest rates and payments along with a limitation on changes in the minimum monthly payments of 7.5 percent per year can result in payments that are not sufficient to pay all of the monthly interest charges (i.e., negative amortization). Unpaid interest is added to the loan balance until the loan balance increases to a specified limit, which can be no more than 115 percent of the original loan amount, at which time a new monthly payment amount adequate to repay the loan over its remaining contractual life is established. At June 30, 2013 , the unpaid principal balance of pay option loans was $6.0 billion, with a carrying amount of $5.8 billion, including $5.3 billion of loans that were credit-impaired upon acquisition, and accordingly, the reserve is based on a life-of-loan loss estimate. The total unpaid principal balance of pay option loans with accumulated negative amortization was $3.6 billion including $225 million of negative amortization. For those borrowers who are making payments in accordance with their contractual terms, 15 percent and 10 percent at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 elected to make only the minimum payment on pay option ARMs. We believe the majority of borrowers are now making scheduled payments primarily because the low rate environment has caused the fully indexed rates to be affordable to more borrowers. We continue to evaluate our exposure to payment resets on the acquired negative-amortizing loans including the PCI pay option loan portfolio and have taken into consideration in the evaluation several assumptions regarding this evaluation including prepayment and default rates. Of the loans in the pay option portfolio at June 30, 2013 that have not already experienced a payment reset, less than one percent are expected to reset before 2016, 19 percent are expected to reset in 2016 and eight percent are expected to reset thereafter . In addition, seven percent are expected to prepay and 66 percent are expected to default prior to being reset, most of which were severely delinquent as of June 30, 2013 . 97 Table of Contents Purchased Credit-impaired Home Equity Loan Portfolio The PCI home equity portfolio comprised 26 percent of the total PCI loan portfolio at June 30, 2013 . Those loans with a refreshed FICO score below 620 represented 18 percent of the PCI home equity portfolio at June 30, 2013 . Loans with a refreshed CLTV greater than 90 percent, after consideration of purchase accounting adjustments and the related valuation allowance, represented 73 percent of the PCI home equity portfolio and 74 percent based on the unpaid principal balance at June 30, 2013 .

U.S. Credit Card The U.S. credit card portfolio is managed in CBB . Outstandings in the U.S. credit card portfolio decreased $4.3 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2013 due to a seasonal decline in retail transaction volume. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 , net charge-offs decreased $327 million to $917 million and $711 million to $1.9 billion compared to the same periods in 2012 due to improvements in delinquencies and bankruptcies as a result of an improved economic environment, account management on higher risk accounts and the impact of higher credit quality originations. U.S. credit card loans 30 days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased $548 million while loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest declined $270 million during the six months ended June 30, 2013 as a result of the factors mentioned above that contributed to lower net charge-offs.

Unused lines of credit for U.S. credit card totaled $327.5 billion at June 30, 2013 compared to $335.5 billion at December 31, 2012 . The $8.0 billion decrease was driven by closure of inactive accounts and account management initiatives on higher risk accounts. 98 Table of Contents Table 38 presents certain state concentrations for the U.S. credit card portfolio.

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 , net charge-offs decreased $31 million to $104 million and $122 million to $216 million compared to the same periods in 2012 due primarily to improvement in delinquencies as a result of higher credit quality originations, and portfolio sales. Unused lines of credit for non-U.S. credit card totaled $29.2 billion at June 30, 2013 compared to $32.2 billion at December 31, 2012 . The $3.0 billion decrease was driven by a weakening of the British Pound against the U.S. Dollar and closure of inactive accounts.

Outstanding loans and leases increased $153 million during the six months ended June 30, 2013 as growth within the consumer dealer financial services auto portfolio and securities-based lending portfolio was offset by a loan sale within the securities-based lending portfolio in connection with the Corporation's agreement to sell the IWM businesses as well as lower outstandings in the unsecured consumer lending portfolio. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 , net charge-offs decreased $95 million to $86 million and $197 million to $210 million , or 0.42 percent and 0.51 percent of total average direct/indirect loans compared to 0.86 percent and 0.95 percent for the same periods in 2012 . These decreases were primarily driven by improvements in delinquencies and bankruptcies in the unsecured consumer lending portfolio as a result of an improved economic environment as well as reduced outstandings. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 , net charge-offs in the unsecured consumer lending portfolio decreased $80 million to $54 million and $167 million to $124 million, or 5.60 percent and 6.04 percent of total average unsecured consumer lending loans compared to 8.03 percent and 8.18 percent for the same periods in 2012 . During the six months ended June 30, 2013 , direct/indirect loans that were past due 30 days or more and still accruing interest declined $282 million to $1.1 billion due to improvements in the unsecured consumer lending, dealer financial services and student lending portfolios. Table 40 presents certain state concentrations for the direct/indirect consumer loan portfolio. Table 40 Direct/Indirect State Concentrations Outstandings Accruing Past Due 90 Days or More Net Charge-offs June 30 2013 December 31 2012 June 30 2013 December 31 2012 Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 (Dollars in millions) 2013 2012 2013 2012 California $ 10,575 $ 10,793 $ 40 $ 53 $ 12 $ 25 $ 27 $ 56 Florida 7,307 7,363 29 37 10 19 23 44 Texas 7,238 7,239 32 41 8 15 20 33 New York 4,761 4,794 23 28 5 13 12 26 Georgia 2,463 2,491 27 31 4 9 9 18 Other U.S./Non-U.S. 51,014 50,525 311 355 47 100 119 230 Total direct/indirect loan portfolio $ 83,358 $ 83,205 $ 462 $ 545 $ 86 $ 181 $ 210 $ 407 Other Consumer At June 30, 2013 , approximately 72 percent of the $1.8 billion other consumer portfolio was associated with certain consumer finance businesses that we previously exited. The remainder is primarily leases within the consumer dealer financial services portfolio included in CBB . Consumer Loans Accounted for Under the Fair Value Option Outstanding consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option were comprised entirely of residential mortgage loans in consolidated variable interest entities of $1.1 billion at June 30, 2013 . During the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 , we recorded net gains of $11 million and $47 million resulting from changes in the fair value of the loan portfolio. These were offset by net losses recorded on the related long-term debt during the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 . 100 Table of Contents Nonperforming Consumer Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity Table 41 presents nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 . Nonperforming LHFS are excluded from nonperforming loans as they are recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value. Nonperforming loans do not include past due consumer credit card loans, other unsecured loans and in general, consumer non-real estate-secured loans (excluding those loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy) as these loans are typically charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due. The charge-offs on these loans have no impact on nonperforming activity and accordingly are excluded from Table 41 . The fully-insured loan portfolio is not reported as nonperforming as principal repayment is insured. Additionally, nonperforming loans do not include the PCI loan portfolio or loans accounted for under the fair value option. For further information on nonperforming loans, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Nonperforming loans decreased $742 million and $891 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 as outflows outpaced new inflows which continued to improve due to favorable delinquency trends. The outstanding balance of a real estate-secured loan that is in excess of the estimated property value less costs to sell is charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due unless repayment of the loan is fully insured. At June 30, 2013 , $9.5 billion, or 50 percent of nonperforming consumer real estate loans and foreclosed properties had been written down to their estimated property value less costs to sell, including $9.0 billion of nonperforming loans 180 days or more past due and $508 million of foreclosed properties. In addition, at June 30, 2013 , $6.3 billion of nonperforming loans, or 34 percent of nonperforming consumer loans, were modified and are now current after successful trial periods, or are current loans classified as nonperforming loans due to regulatory guidance issued in 2012. For more information on regulatory guidance issued in 2012, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 80 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Foreclosed properties decreased $112 million and $142 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 as liquidations outpaced additions. PCI loans are excluded from nonperforming loans as these loans were written down to fair value at the acquisition date; however, once the underlying real estate is acquired by the Corporation upon foreclosure of the delinquent PCI loan, it is included in foreclosed properties. PCI-related foreclosed properties increased $26 million and $73 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 . Not included in foreclosed properties at June 30, 2013 was $1.6 billion of real estate that was acquired upon foreclosure of delinquent FHA-insured loans. We hold this real estate on our balance sheet until we convey these properties to the FHA. We exclude these amounts from our nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties activity as we will be reimbursed once the property is conveyed to the FHA for principal and, up to certain limits, costs incurred during the foreclosure process and interest incurred during the holding period. For more information on the review of our foreclosure processes, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Servicing, Foreclosure and Other Mortgage Matters on page 65 . Restructured Loans Nonperforming loans also include certain loans that have been modified in TDRs where economic concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. These concessions typically result from the Corporation's loss mitigation activities and could include reductions in the interest rate, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance or other actions. Certain TDRs are classified as nonperforming at the time of restructuring and may only be returned to performing status after considering the borrower's sustained repayment performance for a reasonable period, generally six months. Nonperforming TDRs, excluding those modified loans in the PCI loan portfolio, are included in Table 41 . 101 Table of Contents Table 41 Nonperforming Consumer Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity (1) Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 (Dollars in millions) 2013 2012 2013 2012 Nonperforming loans and leases, January 1 $ 19,282 $ 19,724 $ 19,431 $ 18,768 Additions to nonperforming loans and leases: New nonperforming loans and leases 2,289 3,259 4,950 6,567 Implementation of regulatory interagency guidance (2) n/a n/a n/a 1,853 Reductions to nonperforming loans and leases: Paydowns and payoffs (695 ) (858 ) (1,375 ) (2,011 ) Sales (175 ) (175 ) Returns to performing status (3) (1,139 ) (1,271 ) (2,082 ) (2,184 ) Charge-offs (932 ) (1,541 ) (2,004 ) (3,278 ) Transfers to foreclosed properties (4) (90 ) (192 ) (205 ) (594 ) Total net additions (reductions) to nonperforming loans and leases (742 ) (603 ) (891 ) 353 Total nonperforming loans and leases, June 30 (5) 18,540 19,121 18,540 19,121 Foreclosed properties, January 1 (6) 620 1,805 650 1,991 Additions to foreclosed properties: New foreclosed properties (4) 179 190 387 737 Reductions to foreclosed properties: Sales (266 ) (835 ) (484 ) (1,484 ) Write-downs (25 ) (52 ) (45 ) (136 ) Total net reductions to foreclosed properties (112 ) (697 ) (142 ) (883 ) Total foreclosed properties, June 30 508 1,108 508 1,108 Nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties, June 30 $ 19,048 $ 20,229 $ 19,048 $ 20,229 Nonperforming consumer loans and leases as a percentage of outstanding consumer loans and leases (7) 3.43 % 3.33 % Nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties as a percentage of outstanding consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties (7) 3.52 3.52 (1) Balances do not include nonperforming LHFS of $554 million and $606 million and nonaccruing TDRs removed from the PCI loan portfolio prior to January 1, 2010 of $485 million and $461 million at June 30, 2013 and 2012 as well as loans accruing past due 90 days or more as presented in Table 27 and Note 5 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements . (2) As a result of regulatory interagency guidance issued during 2012, we reclassified $1.9 billion of performing home equity loans (of which $1.6 billion were current) to nonperforming. For more information on regulatory interagency guidance, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 80 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K . (3) Consumer loans may be returned to performing status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected, or when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection. (4) New foreclosed properties represents transfers of nonperforming loans to foreclosed properties net of charge-offs taken during the first 90 days after transfer of a loan to foreclosed properties. New foreclosed properties also includes properties obtained upon foreclosure of delinquent PCI loans, properties repurchased due to representations and warranties exposure and properties acquired with newly consolidated subsidiaries. (5) At June 30, 2013 , 49 percent of nonperforming loans were 180 days or more past due and were written down through charge-offs to 62 percent of their unpaid principal balance. (6) Foreclosed property balances do not include loans that are insured by the FHA and have entered foreclosure of $1.6 billion and $1.2 billion at June 30, 2013 and 2012 . (7) Outstanding consumer loans exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. n/a = not applicable Our policy is to record any losses in the value of foreclosed properties as a reduction in the allowance for loan and lease losses during the first 90 days after transfer of a loan to foreclosed properties. Thereafter, further losses in value as well as gains and losses on sale are recorded in noninterest expense. New foreclosed properties included in Table 41 are net of $47 million and $88 million of charge-offs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $60 million and $201 million for the same periods in 2012 , recorded during the first 90 days after transfer. 102 Table of Contents In accordance with regulatory guidance, we classify consumer real estate loans that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower as TDRs, irrespective of payment history or delinquency status, even if the repayment terms for the loan have not been otherwise modified. We continue to have a lien on the underlying collateral. At June 30, 2013 , $4.0 billion of loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy with no change in repayment terms at the time of discharge were included in TDRs, of which $2.0 billion were classified as nonperforming and $2.0 billion were loans fully-insured by the FHA. Of the $4.0 billion of TDRs, approximately 14 percent , 36 percent and 50 percent were discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy in the six months ended June 30, 2013 , in the year ended December 31, 2012 and in years prior to 2012, respectively. In addition, at June 30, 2013 , of the $2.0 billion of nonperforming loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, $1.0 billion were current on their contractual payments while $930 million were 90 days or more past due. Of the contractually current nonperforming loans, more than 70 percent were discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy more than 12 months ago, and nearly 45 percent were discharged 24 months or more ago. As subsequent cash payments are received, the interest component of the payments is generally recorded as interest income on a cash basis and the principal component is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the loan. For more information on the impacts to consumer home loan TDRs, see Note 5 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements . In accordance with bank regulatory interagency guidance, we classify junior-lien home equity loans as nonperforming when the first-lien loan becomes 90 days past due even if the junior-lien loan is performing. At June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 , $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion of such loans were included in nonperforming loans. Table 42 presents TDRs for the home loans portfolio. Performing TDR balances are excluded from nonperforming loans and leases in Table 41 . Table 42 Home Loans Troubled Debt Restructurings June 30, 2013 December 31, 2012 (Dollars in millions) Total Nonperforming Performing Total Nonperforming Performing Residential mortgage (1, 2) $ 31,632 $ 9,460 $ 22,172 $ 28,125 $ 9,040 $ 19,085 Home equity (3) 2,161 1,329 832 2,125 1,242 883 Total home loans troubled debt restructurings $ 33,793 $ 10,789 $ 23,004 $ 30,250 $ 10,282 $ 19,968 (1) Residential mortgage TDRs deemed collateral dependent totaled $9.5 billion and $9.4 billion , and included $6.7 billion and $6.4 billion of loans classified as nonperforming and $2.8 billion and $3.0 billion of loans classified as performing at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 . (2) Residential mortgage performing TDRs included $14.7 billion and $11.9 billion of loans that were fully-insured at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 . (3) Home equity TDRs deemed collateral dependent totaled $1.4 billion at both period ends, and included $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion of loans classified as nonperforming and $311 million and $348 million of loans classified as performing at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 . We work with customers that are experiencing financial difficulty by modifying credit card and other consumer loans, while complying with Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council guidelines. Credit card and other consumer loan modifications generally involve a reduction in the consumer's interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months, all of which are considered TDRs (the renegotiated TDR portfolio). In addition, non-U.S. credit card modifications may involve reducing the interest rate on the account without placing the customer on a fixed payment plan, and these are also considered TDRs (also a part of the renegotiated TDR portfolio). We make modifications primarily through internal renegotiation programs utilizing direct customer contact, but may also utilize external renegotiation programs. The renegotiated TDR portfolio is excluded in large part from Table 41 as substantially all of the loans remain on accrual status until either charged off or paid in full. At June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 , our renegotiated TDR portfolio was $2.8 billion and $3.9 billion , of which $2.2 billion and $3.1 billion were current or less than 30 days past due under the modified terms. The decline in the renegotiated TDR portfolio was primarily driven by paydowns and charge-offs as well as lower program enrollments. For more information on the renegotiated TDR portfolio, see Note 5 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements . 103 Table of Contents Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Commercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal that concentrations of credit exposure do not result in undesirable levels of risk. We review, measure and manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, customer relationship and loan size. We also review, measure and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property type. In addition, within our international portfolio, we evaluate exposures by region and by country. Tables 47 , 52 , 59 and 60 summarize our concentrations. We also utilize syndications of exposure to third parties, loan sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio. For information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status and net charge-offs for the commercial portfolio, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Commercial Credit Portfolio During the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 , credit quality in the commercial loan portfolio continued to show improvement. Reservable criticized balances and nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed property balances declined during the six months ended June 30, 2013 , with the declines primarily in the commercial real estate portfolio. Commercial real estate continued to show improvement in both the residential and non-residential portfolios. Most other credit indicators across the remaining commercial portfolios also improved. The allowance for loan and lease losses for the commercial portfolio increased $62 million to $3.2 billion at June 30, 2013 compared to December 31, 2012 as continued improvement in credit quality was offset by loan growth across the core commercial portfolio (total commercial products excluding U.S. small business). For additional information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 120 . Table 43 presents our commercial loans and leases, and related credit quality information at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 .

(3) Commercial loans accounted for under the fair value option include U.S. commercial loans of $2.0 billion and $2.3 billion and non-U.S. commercial loans of $6.4 billion and $5.7 billion at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 . See Note 17 Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the fair value option. Outstanding commercial loans and leases increased $26.1 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2013 primarily in the non-U.S. commercial and U.S. commercial product types. Nonperforming commercial loans and leases as a percentage of outstanding commercial loans and leases improved during the six months ended June 30, 2013 to 0.55 percent from 0.91 percent ( 0.57 percent and 0.93 percent excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option) at December 31, 2012 . Accruing commercial loans and leases past due 90 days or more as a percentage of outstanding commercial loans and leases was 0.05 percent and 0.06 percent at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 . 104 Table of Contents Table 44 presents net charge-offs and related ratios for our commercial loans and leases for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 . Improving trends across the portfolio drove lower charge-offs.

Table 45 presents commercial credit exposure by type for utilized, unfunded and total binding committed credit exposure. Commercial utilized credit exposure includes standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and financial guarantees, bankers' acceptances and commercial letters of credit for which we are legally bound to advance funds under prescribed conditions, during a specified period. Although funds have not yet been advanced, these exposure types are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes. Total commercial committed credit exposure increased $33.8 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2013 primarily driven by increases in loans and leases. Total commercial utilized credit exposure increased $25.4 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2013 primarily driven by increases in loans and leases. The utilization rate for loans and leases, SBLCs and financial guarantees, commercial letters of credit and bankers' acceptances was 59 percent and 58 percent at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 .

(2) Total commercial unfunded exposure includes loan commitments with a notional value of $15.3 billion and $17.6 billion accounted for under the fair value option at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 . (3) Excludes unused business card lines which are not legally binding. (4) Derivative assets are carried at fair value, reflect the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and have been reduced by cash collateral of $50.5 billion and $58.1 billion at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 . Not reflected in utilized and committed exposure is additional derivative collateral held of $18.4 billion and $18.7 billion which consists primarily of other marketable securities. (5) The net monoline exposure of $1.3 billion at December 31, 2012 was settled during 2013. 105 Table of Contents Table 46 presents commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure by product type. Criticized exposure corresponds to the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful asset categories as defined by regulatory authorities. Total commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure decreased $1.0 billion , or six percent , during the six months ended June 30, 2013 primarily in the commercial real estate portfolio driven largely by continued paydowns, upgrades, charge-offs and sales outpacing downgrades. At June 30, 2013 , approximately 84 percent of commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure was secured compared to 82 percent at December 31, 2012 . Table 46 Commercial Utilized Reservable Criticized Exposure June 30, 2013 December 31, 2012 (Dollars in millions) Amount (1) Percent (2) Amount (1) Percent (2) U.S. commercial $ 8,929 3.73 % $ 8,631 3.72 % Commercial real estate 2,340 5.28 3,782 9.24 Commercial lease financing 1,132 4.73 969 4.06 Non-U.S. commercial 1,742 1.87 1,614 2.02 14,143 3.53 14,996 3.98 U.S. small business commercial 785 6.32 940 7.45 Total commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure $ 14,928 3.62 $ 15,936 4.10 (1) Total commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure includes loans and leases of $13.5 billion and $14.6 billion and commercial letters of credit of $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 . (2) Percentages are calculated as commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure divided by total commercial utilized reservable exposure for each exposure category. U.S. Commercial At June 30, 2013 , 62 percent of the U.S. commercial loan portfolio, excluding small business, was managed in Global Banking, 17 percent in Global Markets , nine percent in GWIM (business-purpose loans for wealthy clients) and the remainder primarily in CBB . U.S. commercial loans, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, increased $9.8 billion , or five percent , during the six months ended June 30, 2013 due to increased client financing activity and growth across the majority of core commercial portfolios. Nonperforming loans and leases decreased $205 million during the six months ended June 30, 2013 . The declines were broad-based with respect to clients and industries, driven by improved client credit profiles and liquidity. Net charge-offs decreased $51 million and $72 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012 primarily due to lower gross charge-offs. Commercial Real Estate The commercial real estate portfolio is predominantly managed in Global Banking and consists of loans made primarily to public and private developers, and commercial real estate firms. Outstanding loans increased $3.5 billion , or nine percent , during the six months ended June 30, 2013 due to new originations in major metropolitan markets. The portfolio remains diversified across property types and geographic regions. California represented the largest state concentration at 22 percent and 23 percent of commercial real estate loans and leases at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 . For the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 , we continued to see improvements in the credit quality in both the residential and non-residential portfolios. We use a number of proactive risk mitigation initiatives to reduce utilized and potential exposure in the commercial real estate portfolios including ongoing refinement of our credit standards, additional transfers of deteriorating exposures to management by independent special asset officers and the pursuit of loan restructurings or asset sales to achieve the best results for our customers and the Corporation. Nonperforming commercial real estate loans and foreclosed properties decreased $1.0 billion , or 57 percent , during the six months ended June 30, 2013 primarily in the non-residential portfolio. Reservable criticized balances decreased $1.4 billion , or 38 percent , primarily due to declines in the non-residential portfolio. Net charge-offs decreased $33 million and $72 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012 due to improvement in the non-residential portfolio. 106 Table of Contents Table 47 presents outstanding commercial real estate loans by geographic region, based on the geographic location of the collateral, and by property type. Commercial real estate primarily includes commercial loans and leases secured by non-owner-occupied real estate and is dependent on the sale or lease of the real estate as the primary source of repayment.

At June 30, 2013 , total committed non-residential exposure was $60.5 billion compared to $54.5 billion at December 31, 2012 , of which $40.6 billion and $37.0 billion were funded secured loans. Non-residential nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties were $576 million and $1.4 billion at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 , which represented 1.41 percent and 3.68 percent of total non-residential loans and foreclosed properties. The decline in nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties in the non-residential portfolio was driven by decreases across all property types. Non-residential utilized reservable criticized exposure decreased to $2.1 billion at June 30, 2013 compared to $3.2 billion at December 31, 2012 , which represented 4.84 percent and 8.27 percent of non-residential utilized reservable exposure, primarily due to continued resolution of legacy criticized exposure. The decrease in reservable criticized exposure was driven by decreases across all property types. For the non-residential portfolio, net charge-offs decreased $5 million and $46 million 108 Table of Contents for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012 primarily due to lower overall levels of criticized and nonperforming assets, as well as higher recoveries of prior charge-offs. Total committed residential exposure of $3.1 billion was relatively unchanged compared to December 31, 2012 with $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion of funded secured loans at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 . Residential nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties decreased $213 million during the six months ended June 30, 2013 due to repayments, sales and loan restructuring. Residential utilized reservable criticized exposure decreased $262 million during the six months ended June 30, 2013 due to continued resolution of legacy criticized exposure. The nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties and the utilized reservable criticized ratios for the residential portfolio were 11.85 percent and 17.41 percent at June 30, 2013 compared to 23.33 percent and 31.56 percent at December 31, 2012 . Net charge-offs for the residential portfolio decreased $28 million and $26 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012 . At June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 , the commercial real estate loan portfolio included $6.5 billion and $6.7 billion of funded construction and land development loans that were originated to fund the construction and/or rehabilitation of commercial properties. Reservable criticized construction and land development loans totaled $828 million and $1.5 billion, and nonperforming construction and land development loans and foreclosed properties totaled $182 million and $730 million at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 . During a property's construction phase, interest income is typically paid from interest reserves that are established at the inception of the loan. As construction is completed and the property is put into service, these interest reserves are depleted and interest payments from operating cash flows begin. We do not recognize interest income on nonperforming loans regardless of the existence of an interest reserve. Non-U.S. Commercial At June 30, 2013 , 71 percent of the non-U.S. commercial loan portfolio was managed in Global Banking and 29 percent in Global Markets . Outstanding loans, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, increased $12.5 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2013 primarily due to increased corporate client demand and client financing activity. Net charge-offs were $16 million and $1 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $7 million and $2 million for the same periods in 2012 . For more information on the non-U.S. commercial portfolio, see Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 116 . U.S. Small Business Commercial The U.S. small business commercial loan portfolio is comprised of small business card loans and small business loans managed in CBB . Card-related products were 46 percent and 45 percent of the U.S. small business commercial portfolio at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 . U.S. small business commercial net charge-offs decreased $85 million and $168 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012 driven by lower delinquencies and bankruptcies resulting from an improvement in credit quality within the small business loan portfolio, an improved economic environment, the reduction of higher risk vintages and the impact of higher credit quality originations. Of the U.S. small business commercial net charge-offs, 72 percent and 74 percent were credit card-related products for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to 62 percent and 64 percent for the same periods in 2012 . Commercial Loans Accounted for Under the Fair Value Option The portfolio of commercial loans accounted for under the fair value option is managed primarily in Global Banking . Outstanding commercial loans accounted for under the fair value option increased $412 million to an aggregate fair value of $8.4 billion at June 30, 2013 compared to December 31, 2012 primarily due to increased corporate borrowings under bank credit facilities. We recorded no net gains or losses and net gains of $46 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to net losses of $53 million and net gains of $75 million for the same periods in 2012 resulting from changes in the fair value of the loan portfolio. These amounts were primarily attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk, were recorded in other income (loss) and do not reflect the results of hedging activities. In addition, unfunded lending commitments and letters of credit accounted for under the fair value option had an aggregate fair value of $486 million and $528 million at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 which was recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The associated aggregate notional amount of unfunded lending commitments and letters of credit accounted for under the fair value option was $15.9 billion and $18.3 billion at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 . We recorded net losses of $19 million and net gains of $46 million from changes in the fair value of commitments and letters of credit during the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to net losses of $112 million and net gains of $292 million for the same periods in 2012 resulting from maturities and terminations at par value and changes in the fair value of the loan portfolio. These amounts were primarily attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk, were recorded in other income (loss) and do not reflect the results of hedging activities. 109 Table of Contents Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity Table 50 presents the nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity during the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 . Nonperforming loans do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 , nonperforming commercial loans and leases decreased $631 million and $1.1 billion to $2.1 billion driven by paydowns, returns to performing status, charge-offs and sales outpacing new nonperforming loans. Approximately 91 percent of commercial nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties are secured and approximately 48 percent are contractually current. Commercial nonperforming loans are carried at approximately 77 percent of their unpaid principal balance before consideration of the allowance for loan and lease losses as the carrying value of these loans has been reduced to the estimated property value less costs to sell.

(3) Commercial loans and leases may be returned to performing status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected or when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection. TDRs are generally classified as performing after a sustained period of demonstrated payment performance. (4) New foreclosed properties represents transfers of nonperforming loans to foreclosed properties net of charge-offs recorded during the first 90 days after transfer of a loan to foreclosed properties. (5) Outstanding commercial loans exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. 110 Table of Contents Table 51 presents our commercial TDRs by product type and performing status. U.S. small business commercial TDRs are comprised of renegotiated small business card loans and are not classified as nonperforming as they are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due. For more information on TDRs, see Note 5 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements .

Our commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. Total committed commercial credit exposure increased $33.8 billion , or four percent , during the six months ended June 30, 2013 to $800.9 billion . The increase in commercial committed exposure was concentrated in diversified financials, banking, real estate and retailing partially offset by lower exposure in food, beverage and tobacco. Industry limits are used internally to manage industry concentrations and are based on committed exposures and capital usage that are allocated on an industry-by-industry basis. A risk management framework is in place to set and approve industry limits as well as to provide ongoing monitoring. Management's Credit Risk Committee (CRC) oversees industry limit governance. Diversified financials, our largest industry concentration, experienced an increase in committed exposure of $15.5 billion , or 16 percent , during the six months ended June 30, 2013 . The increase was driven by higher derivative exposure and funded loans. Real estate, our second largest industry concentration, experienced an increase in committed exposure of $4.5 billion , or seven percent , during the six months ended June 30, 2013 primarily due to new originations and renewals outpacing paydowns and sales. Real estate construction and land development exposure represented 14 percent of the total real estate industry committed exposure at both June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 . For more information on commercial real estate and related portfolios, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Commercial Real Estate on page 106 . Committed exposure to the food, beverage and tobacco industry decreased $5.9 billion , or 16 percent , during the six months ended June 30, 2013 . The decrease was primarily related to commitment reductions and paydowns. Banking committed exposure increased $4.9 billion , or 11 percent , during the six months ended June 30, 2013 driven by loans to mortgage banking companies. Retailing committed exposure increased $4.2 billion , or nine percent , during the six months ended June 30, 2013 driven by loans to auto dealers and general merchandise stores. Materials committed exposure increased $2.9 billion , or seven percent , during the six months ended June 30, 2013 . The increase was related to higher exposure to commodity chemicals and diversified metals manufacturing. Energy committed exposure increased $2.7 billion , or seven percent , during the six months ended June 30, 2013 reflecting higher non-U.S. refining and marketing, and integrated oil and gas exposures. Government and public education committed exposure decreased $2.4 billion , or five percent , during the six months ended June 30, 2013 primarily driven by decreases in derivatives and SBLCs. Our committed state and municipal exposure of $35.1 billion at June 30, 2013 consisted of $28.2 billion of commercial utilized exposure (including $17.1 billion of funded loans, $7.6 billion of SBLCs and $2.3 billion of derivative assets) and unfunded commercial exposure of $6.9 billion (primarily unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit) and is reported in the government and public education industry in Table 52 . While the slow economic recovery continues to pressure budgets, most state and local governments have implemented offsetting fiscal adjustments and continue to honor debt obligations as agreed. While historical default rates have been low, as part of our overall and ongoing risk management processes, we continually monitor these exposures through a rigorous review process. Additionally, internal communications are regularly circulated such that exposure levels are maintained in compliance with established concentration guidelines. 111 Table of Contents Table 52 Commercial Credit Exposure by Industry (1) Commercial Utilized Total Commercial Committed (Dollars in millions) June 30 2013 December 31 2012 June 30 2013 December 31 2012 Diversified financials $ 77,827 $ 66,102 $ 115,066 $ 99,574 Real estate (2) 49,564 47,479 70,162 65,639 Retailing 31,051 28,065 51,906 47,719 Capital goods 26,737 25,071 50,699 49,196 Banking 42,395 39,829 49,730 44,822 Government and public education 39,260 41,441 47,871 50,277 Healthcare equipment and services 29,327 29,396 46,418 45,488 Materials 22,831 21,809 43,369 40,493 Energy 21,052 17,661 41,133 38,441 Consumer services 21,721 23,093 34,743 36,367 Food, beverage and tobacco 14,704 14,738 31,488 37,344 Commercial services and supplies 18,932 19,020 30,478 30,257 Utilities 8,811 8,403 23,660 23,425 Transportation 15,492 13,791 22,716 20,255 Media 13,249 13,091 21,824 21,705 Individuals and trusts 14,367 13,916 18,081 17,801 Software and services 6,389 5,549 13,417 12,125 Insurance, including monolines 5,880 8,491 12,315 14,117 Pharmaceuticals and biotechnology 4,243 3,846 11,473 11,401 Technology hardware and equipment 4,840 5,111 11,289 11,101 Telecommunication services 3,871 4,008 10,588 10,276 Consumer durables and apparel 5,404 4,246 9,942 8,438 Automobiles and components 3,263 3,312 8,262 7,675 Food and staples retailing 4,363 3,528 7,848 6,838 Religious and social organizations 5,895 6,850 7,824 9,107 Other 5,678 3,881 8,550 7,124 Total commercial credit exposure by industry $ 497,146 $ 471,727 $ 800,852 $ 767,005 Net credit default protection purchased on total commitments (3) $ (11,060 ) $ (14,657 ) (1) Includes U.S. small business commercial exposure.

(3) Represents net notional credit protection purchased. See Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Risk Mitigation on page 113 for additional information. Monoline Exposure Monoline exposure is reported in the insurance industry and managed under insurance portfolio industry limits. We have indirect exposure to monolines primarily in the form of guarantees supporting our loans, investment portfolios, securitizations and credit-enhanced securities as part of our public finance business and other selected products. Such indirect exposure exists when we purchase credit protection from monolines to hedge all or a portion of the credit risk on certain credit exposures including loans and CDOs. We underwrite our public finance exposure by evaluating the underlying securities. We also have indirect exposure to monolines in the form of guarantees supporting our mortgage and other loan sales. Indirect exposure may exist when credit protection was purchased from monolines to hedge all or a portion of the credit risk on certain mortgage and other loan exposures. A loss may occur when we are required to repurchase a loan and the market value of the loan has declined, or we are required to indemnify or provide recourse for a guarantor's loss. For more information regarding our exposure to representations and warranties, see Note 8 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements . 112 Table of Contents Table 53 presents the notional amount of our monoline derivative credit exposure, mark-to-market adjustment and the counterparty credit valuation adjustment. The notional amount of monoline exposure decreased $902 million during the six months ended June 30, 2013 due to terminations, paydowns and maturities of monoline contracts.

To lower the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, we may add credit exposure within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. At June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 , net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, was $11.1 billion and $14.7 billion . The mark-to-market effects resulted in net losses of $63 million and $129 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to net gains of $124 million and net losses of $369 million for the same periods in 2012 . The gains and losses on these instruments were offset by gains and losses on the exposures. Table 54 presents the average VaR for these derivatives. See Trading Risk Management on page 125 for a description of our VaR calculation for the market-based trading portfolio.

(4) "NR" is comprised of names that have not been rated. In addition to our net notional credit default protection purchased to cover the funded and unfunded portion of certain credit exposures, credit derivatives are used for market-making activities for clients and establishing positions intended to profit from directional or relative value changes. We execute the majority of our credit derivative trades in the OTC market with large, multinational financial institutions, including broker/dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety of other investors. Because these transactions are executed in the OTC market, we are subject to settlement risk. We are also subject to credit risk in the event that these counterparties fail to perform under the terms of these contracts. In most cases, credit derivative transactions are executed on a daily margin basis. Therefore, events such as a credit downgrade, depending on the ultimate rating level, or a breach of credit covenants would typically require an increase in the amount of collateral required by the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow us to take additional protective measures such as early termination of all trades. 114 Table of Contents Table 57 presents the total contract/notional amount of credit derivatives outstanding and includes both purchased and written credit derivatives. The credit risk amounts are measured as net asset exposure by counterparty, taking into consideration all contracts with that counterparty. For information on our written credit derivatives, see Note 3 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . The credit risk amounts discussed above and presented in Table 57 take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements while amounts disclosed in Note 3 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements are shown on a gross basis. Credit risk reflects the potential benefit from offsetting exposure to non-credit derivative products with the same counterparties that may be netted upon the occurrence of certain events, thereby reducing our overall exposure.

We calculate credit valuation adjustments (CVA) based on a modeled expected exposure that incorporates current market risk factors including changes in market spreads and non-credit related market factors that affect the value of a derivative. The exposure also takes into consideration credit mitigants such as legally enforceable master netting agreements and collateral.

We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in government policies. A risk management framework is in place to measure, monitor and manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. Management oversight of country risk, including cross-border risk, is provided by the Country Credit Risk Committee, a subcommittee of the CRC. In addition to the direct risk of doing business in a country, we also are exposed to indirect country risks (for example, related to the collateral received on secured financing transactions or related to client clearing activities). These indirect exposures are managed in the normal course of business through credit, market and operational risk governance, rather than through country risk governance. Non-U.S. exposure is presented on an internal risk management basis and includes sovereign and non-sovereign credit exposure, securities and other investments issued by or domiciled in countries other than the U.S. The risk assignments by country can be adjusted for external guarantees and certain collateral types. Exposures that are subject to external guarantees are reported under the country of the guarantor. Exposures with tangible collateral are reflected in the country where the collateral is held. For securities received, other than cross-border resale agreements, outstandings are assigned to the domicile of the issuer of the securities. Funded loans and loan equivalents include loans, leases, and other extensions of credit and funds, including letters of credit and due from placements, which have not been reduced by collateral, hedges or credit default protection. Funded loans and loan equivalents are reported net of charge-offs but prior to any allowance for loan and lease losses. Unfunded commitments are the undrawn portion of legally binding commitments related to loans and loan equivalents. Net counterparty exposure includes the fair value of derivatives, including the counterparty risk associated with CDS, and secured financing transactions. Derivative exposures are presented net of collateral, which is predominantly cash, pledged under legally enforceable master netting agreements. Secured financing transaction exposures are presented net of eligible cash or securities pledged as collateral. Securities and other investments are carried at fair value and long securities exposures are netted against short exposures with the same underlying issuer to, but not below, zero (i.e., negative issuer exposures are reported as zero ). Other investments include our GPI portfolio and strategic investments. Net country exposure represents country exposure less hedges and credit default protection purchased, net of credit default protection sold. We hedge certain of our country exposures with credit default protection primarily in the form of single-name, as well as indexed and tranched CDS. The exposures associated with these hedges represent the amount that would be realized upon the isolated default of an individual issuer in the relevant country assuming a zero recovery rate for that individual issuer, and are calculated based on the CDS notional amount less any fair value receivable or payable. Changes in the assumption of an isolated default can produce different results in a particular tranche. 116 Table of Contents Table 59 presents our 20 largest, non-U.S. country exposures. These exposures accounted for 89 percent of our total non-U.S. exposure at both June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 . Net country exposure for these 20 countries decreased $19.8 billion from December 31, 2012 driven by a decrease in funded loans and loan equivalents in Japan resulting from a decrease in central bank deposits and a reduction in unfunded loan commitments in Singapore.

Risks from the ongoing debt crisis in these countries could continue to disrupt the financial markets which could have a detrimental impact on global economic conditions and sovereign and non-sovereign debt in these countries. Market volatility is expected to continue as policymakers address the fundamental challenges of competitiveness, growth and fiscal solvency. We expect to continue to support client activities in the region and our exposures may vary over time as we monitor the situation and manage our risk profile. 117 Table of Contents Table 60 presents our direct sovereign and non-sovereign exposures in these countries at June 30, 2013 . Our total sovereign and non-sovereign exposure to these countries was $15.4 billion at June 30, 2013 compared to $14.5 billion at December 31, 2012 . The total exposure to these countries, net of all hedges, was $9.8 billion at June 30, 2013 compared to $9.5 billion at December 31, 2012 . At June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 , hedges and credit default protection purchased, net of credit default protection sold, was $5.5 billion and $5.1 billion . Net country exposure increased $356 million from December 31, 2012 driven by increased funded loan and loan equivalents with financial institutions in Spain and an increase in sovereign securities in Italy, partially offset by a decrease in corporate exposures across all countries.

Due to our engagement in market-making activities, our CDS portfolio contains contracts with various maturities to a diverse set of counterparties. We work to limit mismatches in maturities between our exposures and the CDS we use to hedge them. However, there may be instances where the protection purchased has a different maturity than the exposure for which the protection was purchased, in which case, those exposures and hedges are subject to more active monitoring and management. Table 61 presents the notional amount and fair value of single-name CDS purchased and sold on reference assets in Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. Table 61 includes only single-name CDS netted at the counterparty level, whereas, Table 60 includes single-name, indexed and tranched CDS exposures netted by the reference asset that they are intended to hedge; therefore, CDS purchased and sold information is not comparable between tables.

(2) Amounts listed are after consideration of legally enforceable counterparty master netting agreements. Losses could result even if there is credit default protection purchased because the purchased credit protection contracts may only pay out under certain scenarios and thus not all losses may be covered by the credit protection contracts. The effectiveness of our CDS protection as a hedge of these risks is influenced by a number of factors, including the contractual terms of the CDS. Generally, only the occurrence of a credit event as defined by the CDS terms (which may include, among other events, the failure to pay by, or restructuring of, the reference entity) results in a payment under the purchased credit protection contracts. The determination as to whether a credit event has occurred is made by the relevant International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) Determination Committee (comprised of various ISDA member firms) based on the terms of the CDS and facts and circumstances for the event. Accordingly, uncertainties exist as to whether any particular strategy or policy action for addressing the European debt crisis would constitute a credit event under the CDS. A voluntary restructuring may not trigger a credit event under CDS terms and consequently may not trigger a payment under the CDS contract. In addition to our direct sovereign and non-sovereign exposures, a significant deterioration of the European debt crisis could result in material reductions in the value of sovereign debt and other asset classes posted as collateral, disruptions in capital markets, widening of credit spreads of U.S. and non-U.S. financial institutions, loss of investor confidence in the financial services industry, a slowdown in global economic activity and other adverse developments. For more information on the debt crisis in Europe, see Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation's 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 119 Table of Contents Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses decreased $562 million to $1.2 billion , and decreased $1.3 billion to $2.9 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012 . The provision for credit losses was $900 million and $1.7 billion lower than net charge-offs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 , resulting in reductions in the allowance for credit losses due to continued improvement in the home loans portfolio as well as lower levels of delinquencies in the credit card portfolio. This compared to reductions of $1.9 billion and $3.5 billion in the allowance for credit losses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012 . If the pace of improvement in the economy continues, w e anticipate additional reductions in the allowance for credit losses, particularly in our consumer real estate portfolios. The provision for credit losses for the consumer portfolio decreased $749 million to $984 million , and decreased $1.9 billion to $2.5 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012 . The improvement was primarily in the home loans portfolio due to increased home prices and improved portfolio trends in the non-PCI loan portfolio and an improved home price outlook in the PCI loan portfolios. The provision for credit losses related to the PCI loan portfolios was a benefit of $252 million and $459 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 primarily due to improvement in our home price outlook compared to provision expense of $6 million and $493 million for the same periods in 2012 . The provision for credit losses for the commercial portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, increased $187 million to $227 million , and increased $635 million to $449 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012 primarily due to stabilization of credit quality, loan growth and a higher volume of loan resolutions in the prior year, all within the core commercial portfolio, partially offset by a decrease in the U.S. small business portfolio as a result of improvement in credit quality. Allowance for Credit Losses Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses The allowance for loan and lease losses is comprised of two components. The first component covers nonperforming commercial loans and TDRs. The second component covers loans and leases on which there are incurred losses that are not yet individually identifiable, as well as incurred losses that may not be represented in the loss forecast models. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses based on the total of these two components, each of which is described in more detail below. The allowance for loan and lease losses excludes LHFS and loans accounted for under the fair value option as the fair value reflects a credit risk component. The first component of the allowance for loan and lease losses covers both nonperforming commercial loans and all TDRs within the consumer and commercial portfolios. These loans are subject to impairment measurement based on the present value of projected future cash flows discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate, or in certain circumstances, impairment may also be based upon the collateral value or the loan's observable market price if available. Impairment measurement for the renegotiated credit card, unsecured consumer and small business TDR portfolios is based on the present value of projected cash flows discounted using the average portfolio contractual interest rate, excluding promotionally priced loans, in effect prior to restructuring. For purposes of computing this specific loss component of the allowance, larger impaired loans are evaluated individually and smaller impaired loans are evaluated as a pool using historical loss experience for the respective product types and risk ratings of the loans. The second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses covers the remaining consumer and commercial loans and leases that have incurred losses which are not yet individually identifiable. The allowance for consumer and certain homogeneous commercial loan and lease products is based on aggregated portfolio evaluations, generally by product type. Loss forecast models are utilized that consider a variety of factors including, but not limited to, historical loss experience, estimated defaults or foreclosures based on portfolio trends, delinquencies, economic trends and credit scores. Our consumer real estate loss forecast model estimates the portion of loans that will default based on individual loan attributes, the most significant of which are refreshed LTV or CLTV, and borrower credit score as well as vintage and geography, all of which are further broken down into current delinquency status. Additionally, we incorporate the delinquency status of underlying first-lien loans on our junior-lien home equity portfolio in our allowance process. Incorporating refreshed LTV and CLTV into our probability of default allows us to factor the impact of changes in home prices into our allowance for loan and lease losses. These loss forecast models are updated on a quarterly basis to incorporate information reflecting the current economic environment. As of June 30, 2013 , the loss forecast process resulted in reductions in the allowance for all major consumer portfolios. The allowance for commercial loan and lease losses is established by product type after analyzing historical loss experience, internal risk rating, current economic conditions, industry performance trends, geographic and obligor concentrations within each portfolio and any other pertinent information. The statistical models for commercial loans are generally updated annually and utilize our historical database of actual defaults and other data. The loan risk ratings and composition of the commercial portfolios used to calculate the 120 Table of Contents allowance are updated at least quarterly to incorporate the most recent data reflecting the current economic environment. For risk-rated commercial loans, we estimate the probability of default and the loss given default (LGD) based on our historical experience of defaults and credit losses. Factors considered when assessing the internal risk rating include the value of the underlying collateral, if applicable, the industry in which the obligor operates, the obligor's liquidity and other financial indicators, and other quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to the obligor's credit risk. As of June 30, 2013 , changes in portfolio size and composition resulted in a small net increase in the commercial allowance, including increases in the allowance for the non-U.S. commercial and commercial lease financing portfolios, and reductions in the allowance for the commercial real estate and U.S. commercial portfolios. Also included within the second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses are reserves to cover losses that are incurred but, in our assessment, may not be adequately represented in the historical loss data used in the loss forecast models. For example, factors that we consider include, among others, changes in lending policies and procedures, changes in economic and business conditions, changes in the nature and size of the portfolio, changes in the volume and severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such as competition, and legal and regulatory requirements. We also consider factors that are applicable to unique portfolio segments. For example, we consider the risk of uncertainty in our loss forecasting models related to junior-lien home equity loans that are current, but have first-lien loans that we do not service that are 30 days or more past due. In addition, we consider the inherent uncertainty in mathematical models that are built upon historical data. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 , the factors that impacted the allowance for loan and lease losses included significant overall improvements in the credit quality of the portfolios driven by improvements in the U.S. economy and housing and labor markets, continuing proactive credit risk management initiatives and the impact of recent higher credit quality originations. Additionally, the resolution of uncertainties through current recognition of net charge-offs has impacted the amount of reserve needed in certain portfolios. Evidencing the improvements in the U.S. economy and housing and labor markets are modest growth in consumer spending, improvements in unemployment levels, a decrease in the absolute level and our share of national consumer bankruptcy filings, and a rise in both residential building activity and overall home prices. In addition to these improvements, paydowns, charge-offs, returns to performing status and upgrades out of criticized continued to outpace new nonaccrual consumer loans and reservable criticized commercial loans, but such loans remained elevated relative to levels experienced prior to the financial crisis. We monitor differences between estimated and actual incurred loan and lease losses. This monitoring process includes periodic assessments by senior management of loan and lease portfolios and the models used to estimate incurred losses in those portfolios. Additions to, or reductions of, the allowance for loan and lease losses generally are recorded through charges or credits to the provision for credit losses. Credit exposures deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan and lease losses. Recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan and lease losses. The allowance for loan and lease losses for the consumer portfolio, as presented in Table 63 , was $18.1 billion at June 30, 2013 , a decrease of $3.0 billion from December 31, 2012 . The decrease was primarily driven by the home equity and residential mortgage portfolios due to improved delinquencies and home prices as evidenced by improving LTV statistics as presented in Tables 30 and 32 . In addition, the home equity and residential mortgage allowance declined due to write-offs in our PCI loan portfolio. These write-offs decreased the PCI valuation allowance included as part of the allowance for loan and lease losses. The decrease in the allowance related to the credit card and unsecured consumer lending portfolios in CBB was primarily due to improvement in delinquencies and bankruptcies. For example, in the U.S. credit card portfolio, accruing loans 30 days or more past due decreased to $2.2 billion at June 30, 2013 from $2.7 billion (to 2.43 percent from 2.90 percent of outstanding U.S. credit card loans) at December 31, 2012 , and accruing loans 90 days or more past due declined to $1.2 billion at June 30, 2013 from $1.4 billion (to 1.29 percent from 1.52 percent of outstanding U.S. credit card loans) at December 31, 2012 . See Tables 27 , 28 , 30 , 32 , 37 and 39 for additional details on key consumer credit statistics. The allowance for loan and lease losses for the commercial portfolio, as presented in Table 63 , was $3.2 billion at June 30, 2013 , a $62 million increase from December 31, 2012 , as continued improvement in credit quality was offset by loan growth across the commercial portfolio. The commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure decreased to $14.9 billion at June 30, 2013 from $15.9 billion (to 3.62 percent from 4.10 percent of total commercial utilized reservable exposure) at December 31, 2012 . Similarly, nonperforming commercial loans declined to $2.1 billion at June 30, 2013 from $3.2 billion (to 0.57 percent from 0.93 percent of outstanding commercial loans) at December 31, 2012 . See Tables 43 , 44 and 46 for additional details on key commercial credit statistics. The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding was 2.33 percent at June 30, 2013 compared to 2.69 percent at December 31, 2012 . The decrease in the ratio was primarily due to improved credit quality driven by improved economic conditions and write-offs in the home equity and residential mortgage PCI loan portfolios which led to the reduction in the allowance for credit losses discussed above. The June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 ratios above include the PCI loan portfolio. Excluding the PCI loan portfolio, the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding was 1.96 percent at June 30, 2013 compared to 2.14 percent at December 31, 2012 . 121 Table of Contents Table 62 presents a rollforward of the allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 .

Consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option included residential mortgage loans of $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 . Commercial loans accounted for under the fair value option included U.S. commercial loans of $2.0 billion and $2.3 billion and non-U.S. commercial loans of $6.4 billion and $5.7 billion at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 . (2) Includes allowance for loan and lease losses for U.S. small business commercial loans of $584 million and $642 million at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 . (3) Includes allowance for loan and lease losses for impaired commercial loans of $328 million and $475 million at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 . (4) Includes $3.9 billion and $5.5 billion of valuation allowance presented with the allowance for credit losses related to PCI loans at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 . Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we also estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments such as letters of credit, financial guarantees, unfunded bankers' acceptances and binding loan commitments, excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value option. Unfunded lending commitments are subject to the same assessment as funded loans, including estimates of probability of default and LGD. Due to the nature of unfunded commitments, the estimate of probable losses must also consider utilization. To estimate the portion of these undrawn commitments that is likely to be drawn by a borrower at the time of estimated default, analyses of the Corporation's historical experience are applied to the unfunded commitments to estimate the funded exposure at default (EAD). The expected loss for unfunded lending commitments is the product of the probability of default, the LGD and the EAD, adjusted for any qualitative factors including economic uncertainty and inherent imprecision in models. The reserve for unfunded lending commitments at June 30, 2013 was $474 million , $39 million lower than December 31, 2012 driven by improved credit quality in the unfunded portfolio. 124 Table of Contents Market Risk Management Market risk is the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions. This risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations, primarily within our Global Markets segment. We are also exposed to these risks in other areas of the Corporation to a lesser extent. In the event of market stress, these risks can have a material impact on the results of the Corporation. Our traditional banking loan and deposit products are nontrading positions and are generally reported at amortized cost for assets or the amount owed for liabilities (historical cost). However, these positions are still subject to changes in economic value based on varying market conditions, primarily changes in the levels of interest rates. The risk of adverse changes in the economic value of our nontrading positions is managed through our ALM activities. We have elected to account for certain assets and liabilities under the fair value option. For further information on the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities, see Note 16 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our trading positions are reported at fair value with changes reflected in income. Trading positions are subject to various changes in market-based risk factors. The majority of this risk is generated by our activities in the interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, mortgage, equity and commodities markets. In addition, the values of assets and liabilities could change due to market liquidity, correlations across markets and expectations of market volatility. We seek to manage these risk exposures by using a variety of techniques that encompass a broad range of financial instruments. The key risk management techniques are discussed in more detail in the Trading Risk Management section. Global Markets Risk Management is an independent function within the Corporation that supports the Global Banking and Markets Risk Executive. The Global Markets Risk Committee (GMRC), chaired by the Global Banking and Markets Risk Executive, has been designated by ALMRC as the primary risk governance authority for Global Markets . The GMRC's focus is to take a forward-looking view of the primary credit, market and operational risks impacting Global Markets and prioritize those that need a proactive risk mitigation strategy. Global Markets Risk Management is responsible for providing senior management with a clear and comprehensive understanding of the trading risks to which the Corporation is exposed. These responsibilities include the ownership of market risk policy, development of quantitative risk models, calculations of aggregated risk measures, establishing and monitoring position limits consistent with risk appetite, conducting daily reviews and analysis of trading inventory, approving material risk exposures and fulfilling regulatory requirements. Market risks that impact businesses outside of Global Markets are monitored and governed by their respective governance authorities. For more information on our market risk management process, see pages 113 through 120 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Trading Risk Management To evaluate risk in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of revenues generated by individual positions as well as portfolios of positions. Various techniques and procedures are utilized to enable the most complete understanding of these risks. Quantitative measures of market risk are evaluated on a daily basis from a single position to the portfolio of the Corporation. These measures include sensitivities of positions to various market risk factors, such as the potential impact on revenue from a one basis point change in interest rates, and statistical measures utilizing both actual and hypothetical market moves, such as VaR and stress testing. Periods of extreme market stress influence the reliability of these techniques to varying degrees. Qualitative evaluations of market risk utilize the suite of quantitative risk measures while understanding each of their respective limitations. Additionally, risk managers independently evaluate the risk of the portfolios under the current market environment and potential future environments. VaR is a common statistic used to measure market risk as it allows the aggregation of market risk factors, including the effects of portfolio diversification. A VaR model simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR represents the loss a portfolio is not expected to exceed more than a certain number of days per year, based on a specified holding period, confidence interval and window of historical data. We use one VaR model consistently across the Corporation that uses a historical simulation approach based on a three-year window of historical data. Our primary VaR statistic is equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level and this means that losses should not exceed VaR, on average, 99 out of 100 trading days. In other words, the portfolio is expected to experience losses greater than VaR two to three times per year. 125 Table of Contents Within any VaR model, there are significant and numerous assumptions that will differ from company to company. The accuracy of a VaR model depends on the availability and quality of historical data for each of the risk factors in the portfolio. A VaR model may require additional modeling assumptions for new products that do not have the necessary historical market data or for illiquid positions for which accurate daily prices are not consistently available. For positions with insufficient historical data for the VaR calculation, the process for establishing an appropriate proxy is based on fundamental and statistical analysis of the new product or illiquid position. This analysis identifies reasonable alternatives that replicate both the expected volatility and correlation to other market risk factors that the missing data would be expected to experience. VaR may not be indicative of realized revenue volatility as changes in market conditions or in the composition of the portfolio can have a material impact on the results. In particular, the historical data used for the VaR calculation might indicate higher or lower levels of portfolio diversification than will be experienced. In order for the VaR model to reflect current market conditions, we update the historical data underlying our VaR model on a bi-weekly basis, or more frequently during periods of market stress, and regularly review the assumptions underlying the model. A relatively minor portion of risks related to our positions are not included in VaR. These risks are regularly reviewed and if deemed material, the VaR results are supplemented. Global Markets Risk Management continually reviews, evaluates and enhances our VaR model so that it reflects the material risks in our trading portfolio. Changes to the VaR model are reviewed and approved prior to implementation and any material changes are reported to management through the appropriate governance committees. Market risk VaR for trading activities as presented below differs from VaR used for regulatory capital calculations (regulatory VaR). The VaR disclosed below excludes both the counterparty credit valuation adjustments, which are adjustments to the mark-to-market value of our derivative exposures to reflect the impact of the credit quality of counterparties on our derivatives assets, and the corresponding hedges. Regulatory standards require that regulatory VaR only exclude the counterparty credit valuation adjustments but include the corresponding hedges. The holding period for regulatory VaR is 10 days while for VaR it is one day. Both regulatory and market risk VaR values utilize the same process and methodology. For more information on certain components in regulatory VaR, see Capital Management Regulatory Capital Changes on page 72 . Table 64 presents period-end, average, high and low daily trading VaR for the three months ended June 30, 2013 , March 31, 2013 and June 30, 2012 , as well as average daily trading VaR for the six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 .

Therefore the amount of portfolio diversification, which is the difference between the total portfolio and the sum of the individual components, is not relevant. The decrease in average and period-end VaR for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2013 was driven by broad-based risk reductions across most asset classes consistent with our current risk appetite, led by lower levels of exposure to real estate/mortgage and credit markets. 126 Table of Contents The graph below presents the daily total market-based trading portfolio VaR for the previous five quarters, corresponding to the data presented in Table 64 . To enhance the visibility of the market risks to which we are exposed, additional VaR statistics produced within the Corporation's single VaR model are provided in Table 65 . Evaluating VaR with additional statistics allows for an increased understanding of the risks in the portfolio as the historical market data used in the VaR calculation does not necessarily follow a predefined statistical distribution. Table 65 presents average trading VaR statistics for 99 percent and 95 percent confidence intervals for the three months ended June 30, 2013 , March 31, 2013 and June 30, 2012 .

The limits are independently set by market risk management and reviewed on a regular basis to ensure they remain relevant and within our overall risk appetite for market risks. Limits are reviewed in the context of market liquidity, volatility and strategic business priorities. The limits are set at both a granular level to ensure extensive coverage of risks as well as at aggregated portfolios to account for correlations among risk factors. Trading limits are approved at least annually. The ALMRC has given authority to the GMRC to approve changes to trading limits throughout the year. Approved trading limits are stored and tracked in a centralized limits management system. Trading limit excesses are communicated to management for review. In periods of market stress, the GMRC members communicate daily to discuss losses, key risk positions and any limit excesses. As a result of this process, the businesses may selectively reduce risk. Where economically feasible, positions are sold or macroeconomic hedges are executed to reduce the exposures. 127 Table of Contents Backtesting The accuracy of the VaR methodology is evaluated by backtesting, which compares the daily VaR results against the realized daily profit and loss. Backtesting excesses occur when a trading loss exceeds the VaR for the corresponding day. These excesses are evaluated to understand the positions and market moves that produced the trading loss and to ensure that the VaR methodology accurately represents those losses. As our primary VaR statistic used for backtesting is based on a 99 percent confidence interval, we expect one trading loss in excess of VaR every 100 days, or between two to three trading losses in excess of VaR over the course of a year. The number of backtesting excesses observed can differ from the statistically expected number of excesses if the current level of market volatility is materially different than the level of market volatility during the three years of historical data used in the VaR calculation. We conduct daily backtests on our portfolios and report the results to senior market risk management. Senior management, including the GMRC, regularly reviews and evaluates the results of these tests. The government agencies that regulate our operations also regularly review these results. Backtesting revenues are defined by regulatory agencies in order to most closely align with the VaR component of the regulatory capital calculation. This revenue differs from total trading-related revenue in that it excludes revenues from trading activities that either do not generate market risk or the market risk cannot be included in VaR. Some examples of the types of revenue excluded for backtesting are fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income and intraday trading revenues. In addition, counterparty credit valuation adjustments are not included in the VaR component of the regulatory capital calculation and are therefore not included in the revenue used for backtesting. There were no days during the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 in which the backtesting revenue was a loss in excess of our total market-based trading portfolio VaR. Total Trading Revenue Total trading-related revenue represents the total amount earned from trading positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. Trading account assets and liabilities are reported at fair value. For more information on fair value, see Note 16 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Trading-related revenues can be volatile and are largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand. Also, trading-related revenues are dependent on the volume and type of transactions, the level of risk assumed, and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the ever-changing market environment. Significant daily revenues by business are monitored and the primary drivers of these are reviewed. When it is deemed material, an explanation of these revenues is provided to the GMRC. 128 Table of Contents The histogram below is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2013 . During the three months ended June 30, 2013 , positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 89 percent, or 57 trading days, of which 67 percent (43 days) were daily trading gains of over $25 million and the largest loss was $54 million. These results can be compared to the three months ended March 31, 2013 , where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 100 percent, or 60 trading days, of which 97 percent (58 days) were daily trading gains of over $25 million. Trading Portfolio Stress Testing Because the very nature of a VaR model suggests results can exceed our estimates and are dependent on a limited historical window, we also stress test our portfolio using scenario analysis. This analysis estimates the change in value of our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements. A set of scenarios, categorized as either historical or hypothetical, are computed daily for the overall trading portfolio and individual businesses. These scenarios include shocks to underlying market risk factors that may be well beyond the shocks found in the historical data used to calculate VaR. Historical scenarios simulate the impact of the market moves that occurred during a period of extended historical market stress. Generally, a 10-business day window or longer representing the most severe point during a crisis is selected for each historical scenario. Hypothetical scenarios provide simulations of the estimated portfolio impact from potential future market stress events. Scenarios are reviewed and updated in response to changing positions and new economic or political information. In addition, new or adhoc scenarios are developed to address specific potential market events. For example, a stress test was conducted to estimate the impact of a full or partial break-up of the Eurozone. The stress tests are reviewed on a regular basis and the results are presented to senior management. Stress testing for the trading portfolio is integrated with enterprise-wide stress testing and incorporated into the limits framework. A process is in place to promote consistency between the scenarios used for the trading portfolio and those used for enterprise-wide stress testing. The scenarios used for enterprise-wide stress testing purposes differ from the typical trading portfolio scenarios in that they have a longer time horizon and the results are forecasted over multiple periods for use in consolidated capital and liquidity planning. For more information on enterprise-wide stress testing, see Managing Risk Enterprise-wide Stress Testing on page 68 . 129 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk Management for Nontrading Activities The following discussion presents net interest income excluding the impact of trading-related activities. Interest rate risk represents the most significant market risk exposure to our nontrading balance sheet. Interest rate risk is measured as the potential change in net interest income caused by movements in market interest rates. Client-facing activities, primarily lending and deposit-taking, create interest rate sensitive positions on our balance sheet. We prepare forward-looking forecasts of net interest income. The baseline forecast takes into consideration expected future business growth, ALM positioning and the direction of interest rate movements as implied by the market-based forward curve. We then measure and evaluate the impact that alternative interest rate scenarios have on the baseline forecast in order to assess interest rate sensitivity under varied conditions. The net interest income forecast is frequently updated for changing assumptions and differing outlooks based on economic trends, market conditions and business strategies. Thus, we continually monitor our balance sheet position in an effort to maintain an acceptable level of exposure to interest rate changes. The interest rate scenarios that we analyze incorporate balance sheet assumptions such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, changes in funding mix, product repricing and maturity characteristics, but do not include the impact of hedge ineffectiveness. Our overall goal is to manage interest rate risk so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital. Table 66 presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 . Table 66 Forward Rates June 30, 2013 December 31, 2012 Federal Funds Three-month LIBOR 10-Year Swap Federal Funds Three-month LIBOR 10-Year Swap Spot rates 0.25 % 0.27 % 2.70 % 0.25 % 0.31 % 1.84 % 12-month forward rates 0.25 0.49 3.08 0.25 0.37 2.10 Table 67 shows the pre-tax dollar impact to forecasted net interest income over the next 12 months from June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 , resulting from instantaneous parallel and non-parallel shocks to the market-based forward curve. Periodically we evaluate the scenarios presented to ensure that they are meaningful in the context of the current rate environment. For further discussion of net interest income excluding the impact of trading-related activities, see page 23 . During the three months ended June 30, 2013 , the 10-year Treasury rate increased more than 60 bps. This increase in long-end rates increased our expectations for net interest income excluding trading-related activities over the next 12 months due to the impact of those higher rates primarily on our residential mortgage and ALM securities portfolios. We continue to be asset sensitive to both a parallel move in interest rates and to a lesser degree a long-end led steepening of the yield curve. Additionally, rising interest rates impact the fair value of debt securities, and accordingly, for debt securities classified as AFS, may adversely affect accumulated OCI and, thus, capital levels. Table 67 Estimated Net Interest Income Excluding Trading-related Net Interest Income (Dollars in millions) Curve Change Short Rate (bps) Long Rate (bps) June 30 2013 December 31 2012 Parallel shifts +100 bps instantaneous shift +100 +100 $ 3,311 $ 4,232 -50 bps instantaneous shift -50 -50 (1,645 ) (2,250 ) Flatteners Short end instantaneous change +100 2,291 2,159 Long end instantaneous change -50 (662 ) (1,597 ) Steepeners Short end instantaneous change -50 (973 ) (655 ) Long end instantaneous change +100 1,029 2,091 130 Table of Contents The sensitivity analysis in Table 67 assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks. Our net interest income was asset sensitive to a parallel move in interest rates at both June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 . As part of our ALM activities, we use securities, residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity. Securities The securities portfolio is an integral part of our interest rate risk management, which includes our ALM positioning, and is primarily comprised of debt securities including MBS and to a lesser extent U.S. Treasury, corporate, municipal and other debt securities. As part of the ALM positioning, we use derivatives to hedge certain debt securities to mitigate the interest rate and duration risk. At June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 , our securities portfolio used for ALM positioning had a carrying value of $336.4 billion and $360.3 billion . During the three months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 , we purchased debt securities of $62.9 billion and $35.4 billion, sold $45.7 billion and $20.0 billion , and had maturities and received paydowns of $27.7 billion and $16.0 billion, respectively. We realized $457 million and $400 million in net gains on sales of AFS debt securities. During the six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 , we purchased debt securities of $99.2 billion and $102.3 billion , sold $61.0 billion and $45.8 billion , and had maturities and received paydowns of $51.7 billion and $34.2 billion , respectively. We realized $525 million and $1.2 billion in net gains on sales of AFS debt securities. At June 30, 2013 , accumulated OCI included an after-tax net unrealized loss of $645 million on AFS debt securities and an after-tax net unrealized gain of $411 million on AFS marketable equity securities compared to after-tax net unrealized gains of $3.7 billion and $16 million at June 30, 2012 . For more information on accumulated OCI, see Note 13 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) to the Consolidated Financial Statements . The pre-tax net amounts in accumulated OCI related to AFS debt securities decreased $6.6 billion and $8.1 billion during the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 to a $1.0 billion net unrealized loss primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates. For more information on our securities portfolio, see Note 4 Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements . We recognized $4 million and $13 million of other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) losses in earnings on AFS debt securities in the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $6 million and $46 million for the same periods in 2012 . The recognition of OTTI losses is based on a variety of factors, including the length of time and extent to which the market value has been less than amortized cost, the financial condition of the issuer of the security including credit ratings and any specific events affecting the operations of the issuer, underlying assets that collateralize the debt security, other industry and macroeconomic conditions, and our intent and ability to hold the security to recovery. Residential Mortgage Portfolio At June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 , our residential mortgage portfolio was $254.0 billion and $252.9 billion excluding $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion of consumer residential mortgage loans accounted for under the fair value option. For more information on consumer fair value option loans, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Consumer Loans Accounted for Under the Fair Value Option on page 100 . The $1.1 billion increase in the six months ended June 30, 2013 was primarily due to the repurchase of certain loans in connection with the FNMA Settlement, new origination volume and repurchases of delinquent FHA loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA, partially offset by paydowns, charge-offs and transfers to foreclosed properties. For more information on the FNMA Settlement, see Note 8 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Three Months Ended June 30, 2013 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2012 During the three months ended June 30, 2013 , CRES and GWIM originated $13.0 billion of first-lien mortgages that we retained compared to $7.9 billion in the same period in 2012 . We repurchased $2.9 billion of delinquent FHA loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA compared to $2.2 billion in the prior-year period. We purchased $27 million of residential mortgages related to ALM activities during the three months ended June 30, 2013 ; there were none in the same period in 2012 . We sold $340 million of residential mortgages compared to $17 million in the same period in 2012 , all of which were originated residential mortgages. Gains recognized on the sales of residential mortgages in both periods were not material. We received paydowns of $15.9 billion compared to $12.2 billion in the same period in 2012 . 131 Table of Contents Six Months Ended June 30, 2013 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2012 During the six months ended June 30, 2013 , CRES and GWIM originated $23.8 billion of first-lien mortgages that we retained compared to $16.2 billion in the same period in 2012 . Additionally, during the six months ended June 30, 2013 in connection with the FNMA Settlement, we repurchased certain residential mortgage loans as mentioned above. We repurchased $6.0 billion of delinquent FHA loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA compared to $2.3 billion in the same period in 2012 . We purchased $27 million of residential mortgages related to ALM activities during the six months ended June 30, 2013 ; there were none in the same period in 2012 . We sold $355 million of residential mortgages compared to $36 million in the same period in 2012 , all of which were originated residential mortgages. Gains recognized on the sales of residential mortgages in both periods were not material. We received paydowns of $29.9 billion compared to $25.1 billion in the same period in 2012 . Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative Contracts Interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts are utilized in our ALM activities and serve as an efficient tool to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk. We use derivatives to hedge the variability in cash flows or changes in fair value on our balance sheet due to interest rate and foreign exchange components. For more information on our hedging activities, see Note 3 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Our interest rate contracts are generally non-leveraged generic interest rate and foreign exchange basis swaps, options, futures and forwards. In addition, we use foreign exchange contracts, including cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign currency forward contracts and options to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Changes to the composition of our derivatives portfolio during the six months ended June 30, 2013 reflect actions taken for interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk management. The decisions to reposition our derivatives portfolio are based on the current assessment of economic and financial conditions including the interest rate and foreign currency environments, balance sheet composition and trends, and the relative mix of our cash and derivative positions. 132 Table of Contents Table 68 presents derivatives utilized in our ALM activities including those designated as accounting and economic hedging instruments and shows the notional amount, fair value, weighted-average receive-fixed and pay-fixed rates, expected maturity and average estimated durations of our open ALM derivatives at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 . These amounts do not include derivative hedges on our MSRs.

The forward starting pay-fixed swap positions at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 were $748 million and $520 million . (2) Does not include basis adjustments on either fixed-rate debt issued by the Corporation or AFS debt securities, which are hedged using derivatives designated as fair value hedging instruments, that substantially offset the fair values of these derivatives. (3) At June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 , the notional amount of same-currency basis swaps was comprised of $219.8 billion and $213.5 billion in both foreign currency and U.S. dollar-denominated basis swaps in which both sides of the swap are in the same currency. (4) Foreign exchange basis swaps consisted of cross-currency variable interest rate swaps used separately or in conjunction with receive-fixed interest rate swaps. (5) Does not include foreign currency translation adjustments on certain non-U.S. debt issued by the Corporation that substantially offset the fair values of these derivatives. (6) The notional amount of option products of $(85) million at June 30, 2013 was comprised of $1.0 billion in MBS options, $(92) million in foreign exchange options, $(1.0) billion in swaptions and $18 million in purchased caps/floors. Option products of $4.2 billion at December 31, 2012 were comprised of $4.2 billion in swaptions and $18 million in purchased caps/floors. (7) Reflects the net of long and short positions. Amounts shown as negative reflect a net short position. (8) The notional amount of foreign exchange contracts of $(2.1) billion at June 30, 2013 was comprised of $36.1 billion in foreign currency-denominated and cross-currency receive-fixed swaps, $(7.2) billion in foreign currency-denominated pay-fixed swaps and $(31.0) billion in net foreign currency forward rate contracts. Foreign exchange contracts of $(1.2) billion at December 31, 2012 were comprised of $41.9 billion in foreign currency-denominated and cross-currency receive-fixed swaps, $(10.5) billion in foreign currency-denominated pay-fixed swaps and $(32.6) billion in net foreign currency forward rate contracts. 133 Table of Contents We use interest rate derivative instruments to hedge the variability in the cash flows of our assets and liabilities and other forecasted transactions (collectively referred to as cash flow hedges). The net losses on both open and terminated cash flow hedge derivative instruments recorded in accumulated OCI, net-of-tax, were $2.7 billion and $2.9 billion at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 . These net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the same period as the hedged cash flows affect earnings and will decrease income or increase expense on the respective hedged cash flows. Assuming no change in open cash flow derivative hedge positions and no changes in prices or interest rates beyond what is implied in forward yield curves at June 30, 2013 , the pre-tax net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings as follows: $936 million , or 22 percent, within the next year, 58 percent in years two through five, and 14 percent in years six through ten, with the remaining six percent thereafter. For more information on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, see Note 3 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . We hedge our net investment in non-U.S. operations determined to have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar using forward foreign exchange contracts that typically settle in less than 180 days, cross-currency basis swaps, foreign exchange options and foreign currency-denominated debt. We recorded net after-tax gains on derivatives and foreign currency-denominated debt in accumulated OCI associated with net investment hedges which were offset by losses on our net investments in consolidated non-U.S. entities at June 30, 2013 . Mortgage Banking Risk Management We originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. We determine whether loans will be HFI or held-for-sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate. Interest rate risk and market risk can be substantial in the mortgage business. Fluctuations in interest rates drive consumer demand for new mortgages and the level of refinancing activity, which in turn, affects total origination and servicing income. Typically, an increase in mortgage interest rates will lead to a decrease in mortgage originations and related fees and an increase in the value of the MSRs driven by lower prepayment expectations. Hedging the various sources of interest rate risk in mortgage banking is a complex process that requires complex modeling and ongoing monitoring. IRLCs and the related residential first mortgage LHFS are subject to interest rate risk between the date of the IRLC and the date the loans are sold to the secondary market. To hedge interest rate risk, we utilize forward loan sale commitments and other derivative instruments including purchased options. These instruments are used to hedge certain market risks of IRLCs and residential first mortgage LHFS. At June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 , the notional amounts of derivatives economically hedging the IRLCs and residential first mortgage LHFS were $27.7 billion and $31.1 billion. MSRs are nonfinancial assets created when the underlying mortgage loan is sold to investors and we retain the right to service the loan. We use certain derivatives such as interest rate options, interest rate swaps, forward settlement contracts and Eurodollar futures, as well as principal-only and interest-only MBS and U.S. Treasuries to hedge certain market risks of MSRs. The fair value and notional amounts of the derivative contracts and fair value of securities hedging the MSRs were $(2.4) billion, $1.8 trillion and $3.2 billion at June 30, 2013 and $2.3 billion, $1.6 trillion and $2.3 billion at December 31, 2012 . For the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 , we recorded losses in mortgage banking income of $752 million and $871 million related to the change in fair value of the derivative contracts and other securities used to hedge the market risks of the MSRs compared to gains of $1.8 billion and $1.3 billion for the same periods in 2012 . For more information on MSRs, see Note 19 Mortgage Servicing Rights to the Consolidated Financial Statements and for more information on mortgage banking income, see CRES on page 37 . Compliance Risk Management The Global Compliance organization is responsible for overseeing compliance risk, which is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss or damage to the reputation of the Corporation in the event of the failure of the Corporation to comply with requirements of applicable banking and financial services laws, rules and regulations, related self-regulatory organization standards, and codes of conduct. Compliance is at the core of the Corporation's culture and is a key component of risk management discipline. The Global Compliance Framework, an addendum to the Bank of America Risk Framework, details the high-level requirements of the global compliance program in one comprehensive document. The Global Compliance Framework also clearly defines roles and responsibilities and is supported by policies that articulate detailed requirements for implementation and execution of the global compliance program. As such, the Global Compliance Framework supports responsible, well-informed compliance risk management that incorporates an ongoing, disciplined approach to proactive planning, oversight, escalation and decision making across the Corporation. The Global Compliance Framework also provides an outline for senior management and the Board, and/or appropriate Board level committee, such as the Audit Committee, to continue to leverage in conducting objective oversight of the Corporation's compliance risk management. The Board provides oversight of compliance risks through its Audit Committee. 134 Table of Contents Operational Risk Management The Corporation defines operational risk as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Operational risk may occur anywhere in the Corporation, including outsourced business processes, and is not limited to operations functions. Its effects may extend beyond financial losses. Operational risk includes legal risk. Successful operational risk management is particularly important to diversified financial services companies because of the nature, volume and complexity of the financial services business. Global banking guidelines and country-specific requirements for managing operational risk were established in Basel 2 which require that the Corporation has internal operational risk management processes to assess and measure operational risk exposure and to set aside appropriate capital to address those exposures. Operational risk is a significant component in the calculation of total risk-weighted assets used in the Basel 3 capital determination. For more information on Basel 3, see Capital Management Regulatory Capital Changes on page 72 . For more information on our operational risk management activities, see page 120 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Complex Accounting Estimates Our significant accounting principles, as described in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K , are essential in understanding the MD&A. Many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments. The more judgmental estimates impacting results for the six months ended June 30, 2013 are summarized in the following discussion. We have identified and described the development of the variables most important in the estimation processes that involve mathematical models to derive the estimates. In many cases, there are numerous alternative judgments that could be used in the process of determining the inputs to the models. Where alternatives exist, we have used the factors that we believe represent the most reasonable value in developing the inputs. Actual performance that differs from our estimates of the key variables could impact our results of operations. Separate from the possible future impact to our results of operations from input and model variables, the value of our lending portfolio and market-sensitive assets and liabilities may change subsequent to the balance sheet date, often significantly, due to the nature and magnitude of future credit and market conditions. Such credit and market conditions may change quickly and in unforeseen ways and the resulting volatility could have a significant, negative effect on future operating results. These fluctuations would not be indicative of deficiencies in our models or inputs. For additional information, see Complex Accounting Estimates on page 121 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 135 Table of Contents Level 3 Assets and Liabilities Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and are significant to the overall fair value measurement are classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy established in applicable accounting guidance. The Level 3 financial assets and liabilities include certain loans, MBS, ABS, CDOs and structured liabilities, as well as highly structured, complex or long-dated derivative contracts, private equity investments and consumer MSRs. The fair value of these Level 3 financial assets and liabilities is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. Table 69 Level 3 Asset and Liability Summary June 30, 2013 December 31, 2012 (Dollars in millions) Level 3 Fair Value As a % of Total Level 3 Assets As a % of Total Assets Level 3 Fair Value As a % of Total Level 3 Assets As a % of Total Assets Trading account assets $ 8,313 25.46 % 0.39 % $ 9,559 26.13 % 0.43 % Derivative assets 7,714 23.63 0.36 8,073 22.06 0.37 AFS debt securities 5,042 15.44 0.24 5,091 13.91 0.23 All other Level 3 assets at fair value 11,581 35.47 0.55 13,865 37.90 0.63 Total Level 3 assets at fair value (1) $ 32,650 100.00 % 1.54 % $ 36,588 100.00 % 1.66 % Level 3 Fair Value As a % of Total Level 3 Liabilities As a % of Total Liabilities Level 3 Fair Value As a % of Total Level 3 Liabilities As a % of Total Liabilities Derivative liabilities $ 6,541 75.05 % 0.35 % $ 6,605 73.51 % 0.33 % Long-term debt 1,890 21.68 0.10 2,301 25.61 0.12 All other Level 3 liabilities at fair value 285 3.27 0.01 79 0.88 0.01 Total Level 3 liabilities at fair value (1) $ 8,716 100.00 % 0.46 % $ 8,985 100.00 % 0.46 % (1) Level 3 total assets and liabilities are shown before the impact of counterparty netting related to our derivative positions. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 , we recognized net gains of $1.7 billion and $2.4 billion on Level 3 assets and liabilities. The net gains during the three months ended June 30, 2013 were primarily gains on net derivative assets and MSRs. Gains on net derivative assets were primarily unrealized gains associated with the performance of various index option contracts as well as production gains on IRLCs. Gains on MSRs were primarily due to the impact of the increase in interest rates on forecasted prepayments. The net gains during the six months ended June 30, 2013 were primarily gains on net derivative assets and MSRs, as discussed above, as well as gains on trading account assets, offset by losses on other assets. Unrealized gains on trading account assets were primarily due to mark-to-market gains on collateralized loan obligation positions due to strong market conditions, as well as mark-to-market gains on secondary loan positions held in inventory. Losses on other assets were primarily due to a write-down of a receivable. There were net unrealized gains of $30 million in accumulated OCI on Level 3 assets and liabilities at June 30, 2013 . For more information on the components of net realized and unrealized gains and losses during three and six months ended June 30, 2013 , see Note 16 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Level 3 financial instruments, such as our consumer MSRs, may be hedged with derivatives classified as Level 1 or 2; therefore, gains or losses associated with Level 3 financial instruments may be offset by gains or losses associated with financial instruments classified in other levels of the fair value hierarchy. The Level 3 gains and losses recorded in earnings did not have a significant impact on our liquidity or capital resources. We conduct a review of our fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of Level 3 are made if the significant inputs used in the financial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities became unobservable or observable, respectively, in the current marketplace. These transfers are considered to be effective as of the beginning of the quarter in which they occur. For more information on the significant transfers into and out of Level 3 during the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 , see Note 16 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements . 136 Table of Contents Representations and Warranties The methodology used to estimate the liability for obligations under representations and warranties related to transfers of residential mortgage loans is a function of the representations and warranties given and considers a variety of factors. Depending upon the counterparty, these factors include actual defaults, estimated future defaults, historical loss experience, estimated home prices, other economic conditions, estimated probability that we will receive a repurchase request, including consideration of whether presentation thresholds will be met, number of payments made by the borrower prior to default and estimated probability that we will be required to repurchase a loan. It also considers other relevant facts and circumstances, such as bulk settlements and identity of the counterparty or type of counterparty, as appropriate. The estimate of the liability for obligations under representations and warranties is based upon currently available information, significant judgment, and a number of factors, including those set forth above, that are subject to change. Changes to any one of these factors could significantly impact the estimate of our liability. The representations and warranties provision may vary significantly each period as the methodology used to estimate the expense continues to be refined based on the level and type of repurchase requests presented, defects identified, the latest experience gained on repurchase requests and other relevant facts and circumstances. The estimate of the liability for representations and warranties is sensitive to future defaults, loss severity and the net repurchase rate. An assumed simultaneous increase or decrease of 10 percent in estimated future defaults, loss severity and the net repurchase rate would result in an increase of approximately $650 million or decrease of approximately $600 million in the representations and warranties liability as of June 30, 2013 . These sensitivities are hypothetical and are intended to provide an indication of the impact of a significant change in these key assumptions on the representations and warranties liability. In reality, changes in one assumption may result in changes in other assumptions, which may or may not counteract the sensitivity. For more information on representations and warranties exposure and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Representations and Warranties on page 58 , as well as Note 8 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein and Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 137 Table of Contents Glossary Alt-A Mortgage A type of U.S. mortgage that, for various reasons, is considered riskier than A-paper, or "prime," and less risky than "subprime," the riskiest category. Alt-A interest rates, which are determined by credit risk, therefore tend to be between those of prime and subprime home loans. Typically, Alt-A mortgages are characterized by borrowers with less than full documentation, lower credit scores and higher LTVs. Assets in Custody Consist largely of custodial and non-discretionary trust assets excluding brokerage assets administered for clients. Trust assets encompass a broad range of asset types including real estate, private company ownership interest, personal property and investments. Assets Under Management (AUM) The total market value of assets under the investment advisory and discretion of GWIM which generate asset management fees based on a percentage of the assets' market values. AUM reflects assets that are generally managed for institutional, high net-worth and retail clients, and are distributed through various investment products including mutual funds, other commingled vehicles and separate accounts. Carrying Value (with respect to loans) The amount at which a loan is recorded on the balance sheet. For loans recorded at amortized cost, carrying value is the unpaid principal balance net of unamortized deferred loan origination fees and costs, and unamortized purchase premium or discount. For loans that are or have been on nonaccrual status, the carrying value is also reduced by any net charge-offs that have been recorded and the amount of interest payments applied as a reduction of principal under the cost recovery method. For PCI loans, the carrying value equals fair value upon acquisition adjusted for subsequent cash collections and yield accreted to date. For credit card loans, the carrying value also includes interest that has been billed to the customer. For loans classified as held-for-sale, carrying value is the lower of carrying value as described in the sentences above, or fair value. For loans for which we have elected the fair value option, the carrying value is fair value. Client Brokerage Assets Include client assets which are held in brokerage accounts. This includes non-discretionary brokerage and fee-based assets which generate brokerage income and asset management fee revenue. Committed Credit Exposure Includes any funded portion of a facility plus the unfunded portion of a facility on which the lender is legally bound to advance funds during a specified period under prescribed conditions. Credit Derivatives Contractual agreements that provide protection against a credit event on one or more referenced obligations. The nature of a credit event is established by the protection purchaser and protection seller at the inception of the transaction, and such events generally include bankruptcy or insolvency of the referenced credit entity, failure to meet payment obligations when due, as well as acceleration of indebtedness and payment repudiation or moratorium. The purchaser of the credit derivative pays a periodic fee in return for a payment by the protection seller upon the occurrence, if any, of such a credit event. A credit default swap is a type of a credit derivative. Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) A portfolio adjustment required to properly reflect the counterparty credit risk exposure as part of the fair value of derivative instruments. Debit Valuation Adjustment (DVA) A portfolio adjustment required to properly reflect the Corporation's own credit risk exposure as part of the fair value of derivative instruments. Interest Rate Lock Commitment (IRLC) Commitment with a loan applicant in which the loan terms, including interest rate and price, are guaranteed for a designated period of time subject to credit approval. Letter of Credit A document issued on behalf of a customer to a third party promising to pay the third party upon presentation of specified documents. A letter of credit effectively substitutes the issuer's credit for that of the customer. Loan-to-value (LTV) A commonly used credit quality metric that is reported in terms of ending and average LTV. Ending LTV is calculated as the outstanding carrying value of the loan at the end of the period divided by the estimated value of the property securing the loan. Estimated property values are primarily determined by utilizing the Case-Schiller Home Index, a widely used index based on data from repeat sales of single family homes. Case-Schiller indices are updated quarterly and are reported on a three-month or one-quarter lag. An additional metric related to LTV is combined loan-to-value (CLTV) which is similar to the LTV metric, yet combines the outstanding balance on the residential mortgage loan and the outstanding carrying value on the home equity loan or available line of credit, both of which are secured by the same property, divided by the estimated value of the property. A LTV of 100 percent reflects a loan that is currently secured by a property valued at an amount exactly equal to the carrying value or available line of the loan. Under certain circumstances, estimated values can also be determined by utilizing an automated valuation method (AVM) or Mortgage Risk 138 Table of Contents Assessment Corporation (MRAC) index. An AVM is a tool that estimates the value of a property by reference to large volumes of market data including sales of comparable properties and price trends specific to the MSA in which the property being valued is located. The MRAC index is similar to the Case-Schiller Home Index in that it is an index that is based on data from repeat sales of single family homes and is reported on a lag. Margin Receivable An extension of credit secured by eligible securities in certain brokerage accounts. Matched Book Repurchase and resale agreements and securities borrowed and loaned transactions entered into to accommodate customers and earn interest rate spreads. Mortgage Servicing Right (MSR) The right to service a mortgage loan when the underlying loan is sold or securitized. Servicing includes collections for principal, interest and escrow payments from borrowers and accounting for and remitting principal and interest payments to investors. Net Interest Yield Net interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets. Nonperforming Loans and Leases Includes loans and leases that have been placed on nonaccrual status, including nonaccruing loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties (TDRs). Loans accounted for under the fair value option, PCI loans and LHFS are not reported as nonperforming loans and leases. Consumer credit card loans, business card loans, consumer loans secured by personal property (except for certain secured consumer loans, including those that have been modified in a TDR), and consumer loans secured by real estate that are insured by the FHA or through long-term credit protection agreements with FNMA and FHLMC (fully-insured loan portfolio), are not placed on nonaccrual status and are, therefore, not reported as nonperforming loans and leases. Purchased Credit-impaired (PCI) Loan A loan purchased as an individual loan, in a portfolio of loans or in a business combination with evidence of deterioration in credit quality since origination for which it is probable, upon acquisition, that the investor will be unable to collect all contractually required payments. These loans are recorded at fair value upon acquisition. Subprime Loans Although a standard industry definition for subprime loans (including subprime mortgage loans) does not exist, the Corporation defines subprime loans as specific product offerings for higher risk borrowers, including individuals with one or a combination of high credit risk factors, such as low FICO scores, high debt to income ratios and inferior payment history. Tier 1 Common Capital Tier 1 capital less preferred stock, qualifying trust preferred securities, hybrid securities and qualifying noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries. Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs) Loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. Certain consumer loans for which a binding offer to restructure has been extended are also classified as TDRs. Concessions could include a reduction in the interest rate to a rate that is below market on the loan, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance, loans discharged in bankruptcy or other actions intended to maximize collection. Secured consumer loans that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not been reaffirmed by the borrower are classified as TDRs at the time of discharge from bankruptcy. TDRs are generally reported as nonperforming loans and leases while on nonaccrual status. Nonperforming TDRs may be returned to accrual status when, among other criteria, payment in full of all amounts due under the restructured terms is expected and the borrower has demonstrated a sustained period of repayment performance, typically six months. TDRs that are on accrual status are reported as performing TDRs through the end of the calendar year in which the restructuring occurred or the year in which they are returned to accrual status. In addition, if accruing TDRs bear less than a market rate of interest at the time of modification, they are reported as performing TDRs throughout their remaining lives unless and until they cease to perform in accordance with their modified contractual terms, at which time they would be placed on nonaccrual status and reported as nonperforming TDRs. Value-at-Risk (VaR) VaR is a model that simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of hypothetical scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR represents the loss the portfolio is expected to experience with a given confidence level based on historical data. A VaR model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of potential gains and losses on our trading portfolios. 139 Table of Contents Acronyms ABS Asset-backed securities AFS Available-for-sale ALM Asset and liability management ALMRC Asset Liability and Market Risk Committee ARM Adjustable-rate mortgage BHC Bank holding company CCAR Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review CDO Collateralized debt obligation CLO Collateralized loan obligation CMBS Commercial mortgage-backed securities CRA Community Reinvestment Act CRC Credit Risk Committee EAD Exposure at default EU European Union FDIC Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FHA Federal Housing Administration FHLMC Freddie Mac FICC Fixed income, currencies and commodities FICO Fair Isaac Corporation (credit score) FNMA Fannie Mae FTE Fully taxable-equivalent GAAP Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GMRC Global Markets Risk Committee GNMA Government National Mortgage Association GSE Government-sponsored enterprise HELOC Home equity lines of credit HFI Held-for-investment HUD U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development LCR Liquidity Coverage Ratio LGD Loss given default LHFS Loans held-for-sale LIBOR London InterBank Offered Rate MBS Mortgage-backed securities MD&A Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MI Mortgage insurance MSA Metropolitan statistical area NSFR Net Stable Funding Ratio OCC Office of the Comptroller of the Currency OCI Other comprehensive income OTC Over-the-counter OTTI Other-than-temporary impairment PPI Payment protection insurance RMBS Residential mortgage-backed securities SBLCs Standby letters of credit SEC Securities and Exchange Commission VA U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs VIE Variable interest entity 140 Table of Contents
