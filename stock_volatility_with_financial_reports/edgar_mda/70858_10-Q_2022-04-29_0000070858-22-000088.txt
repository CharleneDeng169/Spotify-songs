We operate our banking activities primarily under the Bank of America, National Association (Bank of America, N.A. or BANA) charter. At March 31, 2022, the Corporation had $3.2 trillion in assets and a headcount of approximately 208,000 employees. As of March 31, 2022, we served clients through operations across the U.S., its territories and approximately 35 countries.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the information contained on our website as referenced in this paragraph is not incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Recent Developments Russia/Ukraine Conflict Due to the Russia/Ukraine conflict, there has been significant volatility in financial markets and commodities markets. In addition, multiple jurisdictions have implemented various economic sanctions on select Russian government and military leaders, financial institutions, business leaders and the Central Bank of Russia. The government of Russia has also implemented economic sanctions on certain non-Russian institutions and prevented outflows of selected currencies from Russia. At March 31, 2022, our direct net country exposure to Russia was $759 million, which primarily consisted of outstanding loans and leases totaling $679 million. All of our loans to Russian counterparties have been downgraded and reported as reservable criticized exposure, with their expected credit losses incorporated into our estimate of the allowance for credit losses. At March 31, 2022, our net country exposure to Ukraine was not significant. For more information on our Russian exposure, see Credit Risk Management on page 25. While the Corporation direct exposure to Russia is limited, the potential duration and impact of the Russia/Ukraine conflict and sanctions regime, including the impact of future sanctions, on global markets, institutions and macroeconomic conditions generally, as well as other future possible geopolitical consequences arising from the current conflict, remain uncertain. Episodes of economic and market volatility and pressure on supply chains and inflation may continue to occur and could worsen if the conflict persists or increases in severity. As a result, the Corporation's businesses, results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected by any of these factors directly or indirectly arising from the Russia/Ukraine conflict. For more information on the risks related to the Russia/Ukraine conflict, see the Market and Geopolitical sections within Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Capital Management On April 27, 2022, the Corporation announced that the Board of Directors (the Board) declared a quarterly cash common stock dividend of $0.21 per share, payable on June 24, 2022 to shareholders of record as of June 3, 2022. For more information on our capital resources, see Capital Management on page 18. 3 Bank of America LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rates Immediately after December 31, 2021, ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA) ceased publishing British Pound Sterling (GBP), Euro, Swiss Franc, and Japanese Yen (JPY) London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) settings and one-week and two-month U.S. dollar (USD) LIBOR settings. However, certain GBP and JPY LIBOR settings that became no longer representative of the underlying market that such rates sought to measure are being published using a modified calculation (i.e., on a synthetic basis). The remaining USD LIBOR settings (i.e., overnight, one month, three month, six month and 12 month) will cease or become non-representative immediately after June 30, 2023. The Corporation continues to execute its enterprise-wide transition program with respect to Interbank Offered Rates. The Corporation has ceased entering into new contracts that use USD LIBOR as a reference rate, subject to certain exceptions permitted under the supervisory guidance issued by the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The Corporation also continues to monitor a variety of market scenarios as part of its transition efforts, including risks associated with insufficient preparation by individual market participants or the overall market ecosystem, ability of market participants to transition away from impacted benchmarks, and access and demand by clients and market participants to liquidity in certain products, including LIBOR products. As previously disclosed, the Corporation has remediated a significant majority of its notional contractual exposure to LIBOR products referencing USD LIBOR settings ceasing or becoming non-representative immediately after June 30, 2023 (i.e., updated to include fallback provisions to alternative reference rates (ARRs), e.g., the Secured Overnight Financing Rate for USD LIBOR, based on market-driven protocols, regulatory guidance, and industry-recommended fallback provisions and related mechanisms). The remaining non-remediated USD LIBOR exposure, a majority of which is made up of derivatives and commercial loans, represents a small minority of outstanding USD LIBOR notional contractual exposure of the Corporation and will require active dialogue with clients to modify the contracts. For any residual exposures after June 2023 that continue to have no fallback provisions, the Corporation is assessing and planning to leverage relevant contractual and statutory solutions, including the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act, enacted in March 2022 at the federal level in the U.S., and other relevant legislation, to transition such exposure to ARRs. For more information on the expected replacement of LIBOR and other benchmark rates, see Executive Summary Recent Developments LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rates in the MD&A and Item 1A. Risk Factors Other of the Corporation 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Financial Highlights Table 1 Summary Income Statement and Selected Financial Data Three Months Ended March 31 (Dollars in millions, except per share information) 2022 2021 Income statement Net interest income $ 11,572 $ 10,197 Noninterest income 11,656 12,624 Total revenue, net of interest expense 23,228 22,821 Provision for credit losses 30 (1,860) Noninterest expense 15,319 15,515 Income before income taxes 7,879 9,166 Income tax expense 812 1,116 Net income 7,067 8,050 Preferred stock dividends 467 490 Net income applicable to common shareholders $ 6,600 $ 7,560 Per common share information Earnings $ 0.81 $ 0.87 Diluted earnings 0.80 0.86 Dividends paid 0.21 0.18 Performance ratios Return on average assets (1) 0.89 % 1.13 % Return on average common shareholders equity (1) 11.02 12.28 Return on average tangible common shareholders equity (2) 15.51 17.08 Efficiency ratio (1) 65.95 67.98 March 31 2022 December 31 2021 Balance sheet Total loans and leases $ 993,145 $ 979,124 Total assets 3,238,223 3,169,495 Total deposits 2,072,409 2,064,446 Total liabilities 2,971,606 2,899,429 Total common shareholders equity 239,480 245,358 Total shareholders equity 266,617 270,066 (1) For definitions, see Key Metrics on page 92. (2) Return on average tangible common shareholders equity is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information and a corresponding reconciliation to the most closely related financial measures defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 43. Net income was $7.1 billion, or $0.80 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to $8.1 billion, or $0.86 per diluted share, for the same period in 2021. The decrease in net income was primarily due to an increase in the provision for credit losses and lower noninterest income, partially offset by higher net interest income and lower noninterest expense. Total assets increased $68.7 billion from December 31, 2021 to $3.2 trillion primarily due to higher trading account assets and federal funds sold and securities borrowed under agreements to resell to support Global Markets client activity, as well as loan growth. Bank of America 4 Total liabilities increased $72.2 billion from December 31, 2021 to $3.0 trillion primarily driven by an increase in federal funds purchased and securities loaned under agreements to repurchase, accrued expenses and other liabilities and trading account liabilities due to increased activity in Global Markets . Shareholders equity decreased $3.4 billion from December 31, 2021 primarily due to market value decreases on derivatives and debt securities and returns of capital to shareholders through common stock repurchases and common and preferred stock dividends, partially offset by net income and the issuance of preferred stock. Net Interest Income Net interest income increased $1.4 billion to $11.6 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. Net interest yield on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis increased 1 basis point (bp) to 1.69 percent. The increase in net interest income was primarily driven by the deployment of cash from deposit inflows into debt securities, loan growth and lower premium amortization, partially offset by a decrease in the acceleration of net capitalized loan fees due to Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan forgiveness. For more information on net interest yield and the FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 5, and for more information on interest rate risk management, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 41. Noninterest Income Table 2 Noninterest Income Three Months Ended March 31 (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Fees and commissions: Card income $ 1,403 $ 1,435 Service charges 1,833 1,792 Investment and brokerage services 4,292 4,063 Investment banking fees 1,457 2,246 Total fees and commissions 8,985 9,536 Market making and similar activities 3,238 3,529 Other income (567) (441) Total noninterest income $ 11,656 $ 12,624 Noninterest income decreased $968 million to $11.7 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. The following highlights the significant changes. Investment and brokerage services increased $229 million primarily driven by the impacts of higher market valuations and assets under management (AUM) flows, partially offset by declines in AUM pricing. Investment banking fees decreased $789 million primarily driven by lower equity issuance and debt issuance fees, partially offset by higher advisory fees. Market making and similar activities decreased $291 million primarily driven by a weaker performance in Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC). The decrease was due to gains in commodities in the prior-year period for a weather-related event and a weaker trading environment for credit products in the current-year period, partially offset by improved performance across macro products, increased client activity and a strong trading performance in Equity derivatives. Other income decreased $126 million primarily due to certain valuation adjustments. Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses increased $1.9 billion to $30 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to a benefit of $1.9 billion in the same period in 2021. The increase was primarily due to asset quality improvement offset by a reserve build related to Russian exposure and loan growth, compared to the impact of the improved macroeconomic outlook in the prior-year period. For more information on the provision for credit losses, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 37. Noninterest Expense Table 3 Noninterest Expense Three Months Ended March 31 (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Compensation and benefits $ 9,482 $ 9,736 Occupancy and equipment 1,760 1,830 Information processing and communications 1,540 1,425 Product delivery and transaction related 933 977 Marketing 397 371 Professional fees 450 403 Other general operating 757 773 Total noninterest expense $ 15,319 $ 15,515 Noninterest expense decreased $196 million to $15.3 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. The prior-year period included the acceleration of expenses due to incentive compensation award changes and an impairment charge for real estate rationalization. In addition, the current-year period included lower net Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) costs, partially offset by continued investment in the business. Income Tax Expense Table 4 Income Tax Expense Three Months Ended March 31 (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Income before income taxes $ 7,879 $ 9,166 Income tax expense 812 1,116 Effective tax rate 10.3 % 12.2 % The effective tax rates for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 were primarily driven by our recurring tax preference benefits that mainly consist of tax credits from ESG investments in affordable housing and renewable energy. Absent the ESG tax credits, the effective tax rates would have been approximately 24 percent and 23 percent, respectively. Supplemental Financial Data Non-GAAP Financial Measures In this Form 10-Q, we present certain non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items or otherwise include components that differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional useful information to assess our financial condition, results of operations (including period-to-period operating performance) or compliance with prospective regulatory requirements. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as a substitute 5 Bank of America for GAAP financial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same way as non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. We view net interest income and related ratios and analyses on an FTE basis, which when presented on a consolidated basis are non-GAAP financial measures. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 21 percent and a representative state tax rate. Net interest yield, which measures the basis points we earn over the cost of funds, utilizes net interest income on an FTE basis. We believe that presentation of these items on an FTE basis allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practices. We may present certain key performance indicators and ratios excluding certain items (e.g., debit valuation adjustment (DVA) gains (losses)), which result in non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the presentation of measures that exclude these items is useful because such measures provide additional information to assess the underlying operational performance and trends of our businesses and to allow better comparison of period-to-period operating performance. We also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents shareholders equity or common shareholders equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)), net of related deferred tax liabilities ( adjusted shareholders equity or common shareholders equity). These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models use both return on average tangible common shareholders equity and return on average tangible shareholders equity as key measures to support our overall growth objectives. These ratios are: Return on average tangible common shareholders equity measures our net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average common shareholders equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders equity divided by total tangible assets. Return on average tangible shareholders equity measures our net income as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders equity divided by total tangible assets. Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders equity divided by ending common shares outstanding. We believe ratios utilizing tangible equity provide additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. Tangible book value per common share provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation to outstanding shares of common stock. The aforementioned supplemental data and performance measures are presented in Table 5 on page 7. For more information on the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 43. Key Performance Indicators We present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance indicators (key performance indicators) that management uses when assessing our consolidated and/or segment results. We believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information about our underlying operational performance and trends. These key performance indicators (KPIs) may not be defined or calculated in the same way as similar KPIs used by other companies. For information on how these metrics are defined, see Key Metrics on page 92. Our consolidated key performance indicators, which include various equity and credit metrics, are presented in Table 1 on page 4 and Table 5 on page 7. For information on key segment performance metrics, see Business Segment Operations on page 9.

Bank of America 8 Business Segment Operations Segment Description and Basis of Presentation We report our results of operations through four business segments: Consumer Banking, GWIM, Global Banking and Global Markets , with the remaining operations recorded in All Other . We manage our segments and report their results on an FTE basis. For more information, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. We periodically review capital allocated to our businesses and allocate capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. We utilize a methodology that considers the effect of regulatory capital requirements in addition to internal risk-based capital models. Our internal risk-based capital models use a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment credit, market, interest rate, business and operational risk components. For more information on the nature of these risks, see Managing Risk on page 18. The capital allocated to the business segments is referred to as allocated capital. Allocated equity in the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting unit. For more information, including the definition of a reporting unit, see Note 7 Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For more information on our presentation of financial information on an FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 5, and for reconciliations to consolidated total revenue, net income and period-end total assets, see Note 17 Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Key Performance Indicators We present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance indicators that management uses when evaluating segment results. We believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information about our segments operational performance, customer trends and business growth.

For more information about Consumer Banking , see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Consumer Banking Results Net income for Consumer Banking increased $294 million to $3.0 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 due to higher revenue and lower noninterest expense, partially offset by a lower benefit in the provision for credit losses. Net interest income increased $760 million to $6.7 billion primarily due to the benefit of higher deposit balances and the allocation of asset and liability management (ALM) results, partially offset by a decrease in the acceleration of net capitalized loan fees due to PPP loan forgiveness. Noninterest income decreased $16 million to $2.1 billion primarily driven by changes to overdraft services, lower mortgage banking income, the allocation of ALM results and lower card income, partially offset by higher other service charges due to increased client activity. The benefit in the provision for credit losses decreased $565 million to $52 million primarily due to the impact of the improved macroeconomic outlook in the prior-year period. Noninterest expense decreased $210 million to $4.9 billion primarily driven by an impairment charge for real estate rationalization in the prior-year period, partially offset by continued investments for business growth and increased client activity. The return on average allocated capital was 30 percent, up from 28 percent, driven by higher net income, partially offset by an increase in allocated capital. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 9. Deposits Net income for Deposits increased $741 million to $1.4 billion due to higher revenue and lower noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $774 million to $4.1 billion primarily due to the allocation of ALM results and the benefit of higher deposit balances. Noninterest income increased $5 million to $903 million primarily driven by higher other service charges due to increased client activity and investment and brokerage fees, largely offset by changes to overdraft services and the allocation of ALM results. Noninterest expense decreased $201 million to $3.0 billion primarily driven by an impairment charge for real estate rationalization in the prior-year period, partially offset by continued investments for business growth and increased client activity. Average deposits increased $132.9 billion to $1.1 trillion primarily due to net inflows of $79.1 billion in checking and $51.1 billion in money market savings largely driven by strong organic growth. The table below provides key performance indicators for Deposits. Management uses these metrics, and we believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information to evaluate our deposit profitability and digital/mobile trends.

(4) Represents mobile active users over the past 90 days. Consumer investment assets increased $33.1 billion to $357.6 billion driven by client flows and market performance. Active mobile banking users increased approximately two million, reflecting continuing changes in our customers banking preferences. We had a net decrease of 268 financial centers and 946 ATMs as we continue to optimize our consumer banking network. Bank of America 10 Consumer Lending Net income for Consumer Lending decreased $447 million to $1.6 billion primarily due to a lower benefit in the provision for credit losses. Net interest income declined $14 million to $2.6 billion primarily due to a decrease in the acceleration of net capitalized loan fees due to PPP loan forgiveness, largely offset by the allocation of ALM results. Noninterest income decreased $21 million to $1.2 billion primarily driven by lower mortgage banking income. The benefit in the provision for credit losses decreased $566 million to $125 million primarily due to the impact of the improved macroeconomic outlook in the prior-year period. Average loans decreased $6.4 billion to $279.9 billion primarily driven by a decline in PPP loans, partially offset by an increase in credit card loans. The table below provides key performance indicators for Consumer Lending. Management uses these metrics, and we believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information about loan growth and profitability.

During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the total risk-adjusted margin increased 111 basis points (bps) compared to the same period in 2021 primarily driven by lower net credit losses, partially offset by lower net interest margin and lower fee income. Total credit card purchase volumes increased $16.3 billion to $80.9 billion as spending continued to recover, with improvements across all categories. Debit card purchase volumes increased $9.7 billion to $117.6 billion due to continued growth in spending.

For more information about GWIM , see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Net income for GWIM increased $251 million to $1.1 billion driven by higher revenue, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. The operating margin was 27 percent compared to 24 percent a year ago. Net interest income increased $337 million to $1.7 billion driven by the benefits of deposit and loan growth. Noninterest income, which primarily includes investment and brokerage services income, increased $168 million to $3.8 billion primarily due to the impacts of higher market valuations and positive AUM flows, partially offset by declines in AUM pricing. Noninterest expense increased $148 million to $4.0 billion primarily driven by higher revenue-related incentives. The return on average allocated capital was 26 percent, up from 22 percent, due to higher net income, partially offset by an increase in allocated capital. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 9. Average loans increased $22.4 billion to $210.9 billion primarily driven by securities-based lending, residential mortgage and custom lending. Average deposits increased $58.5 billion to $384.9 billion primarily driven by inflows from new and existing accounts. Merrill Wealth Management revenue of $4.6 billion increased 10 percent primarily driven by higher asset management fees and the benefits of deposit and loan growth. Bank of America Private Bank revenue of $887 million increased 13 percent driven by the benefits of deposit and loan growth and higher market valuations.

For more information about Global Banking, ee Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Net income for Global Banking decreased $449 million to $1.7 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 driven by higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher revenue and lower noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $364 million to $2.3 billion primarily due to the allocation of ALM results and the benefit of higher deposit and loan balances, partially offset by lower credit and deposit spreads. Noninterest income increased $197 million to $2.9 billion driven by growth in ESG investment activities, partially offset by lower investment banking fees. In addition, the prior-year period included weather-related impairment charges on certain renewable energy investments. The provision for credit losses increased $1.3 billion to $165 million primarily due to a reserve build driven by Russian exposure and loan growth compared to a benefit in the provision for credit losses of $1.1 billion in the prior-year period due to the improved macroeconomic outlook. Noninterest expense decreased $99 million to $2.7 billion, as the prior-year period included an acceleration of expenses due to incentive compensation award changes, partially offset by continued investment in the business. The return on average allocated capital was 16 percent, down from 21 percent, due to lower net income and higher allocated capital.

Bank of America 14 Global Corporate, Global Commercial and Business Banking Global Corporate Banking Global Commercial Banking Business Banking Total Three Months Ended March 31 (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 Revenue Business Lending $ 1,060 $ 654 $ 993 $ 898 $ 58 $ 55 $ 2,111 $ 1,607 Global Transaction Services (1) 949 711 896 772 243 222 2,088 1,705 Total revenue, net of interest expense $ 2,009 $ 1,365 $ 1,889 $ 1,670 $ 301 $ 277 $ 4,199 $ 3,312 Balance Sheet Average Total loans and leases $ 166,994 $ 148,237 $ 177,483 $ 160,309 $ 12,837 $ 13,001 $ 357,314 $ 321,547 Total deposits (1) 257,903 229,925 223,741 203,777 58,268 53,309 539,912 487,011 Period end Total loans and leases $ 174,134 $ 148,914 $ 179,253 $ 155,842 $ 12,794 $ 12,813 $ 366,181 $ 317,569 Total deposits (1) 255,694 242,923 219,462 207,810 58,660 55,248 533,816 505,981 (1) Prior periods have been revised to conform to current-period presentation. Business Lending revenue increased $504 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to ESG investment activities and the benefit of higher loan balances, partially offset by lower credit spreads. In addition, the prior-year period included weather-related impairment charges on certain renewable energy investments. Global Transaction Services revenue increased $383 million driven by the allocation of ALM results and the benefit of higher deposit balances, partially offset by lower deposit spreads. Average loans and leases increased 11 percent due to higher client demand. Average deposits increased 11 percent due to continued portfolio growth. Global Investment Banking Client teams and product specialists underwrite and distribute debt, equity and loan products, and provide advisory services and tailored risk management solutions. The economics of certain investment banking and underwriting activities are shared primarily between Global Banking and Global Markets under an internal revenue-sharing arrangement. Global Banking originates certain deal-related transactions with our corporate and commercial clients that are executed and distributed by Global Markets . To provide a complete discussion of our consolidated investment banking fees, the table below presents total Corporation investment banking fees and the portion attributable to Global Banking. Investment Banking Fees Global Banking Total Corporation Three Months Ended March 31 (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Products Advisory $ 439 $ 357 $ 473 $ 400 Debt issuance 359 423 831 988 Equity issuance 82 392 225 900 Gross investment banking fees 880 1,172 1,529 2,288 Self-led deals (29) (17) (72) (42) Total investment banking fees $ 851 $ 1,155 $ 1,457 $ 2,246 Total Corporation investment banking fees of $1.5 billion, which exclude self-led deals and are primarily included within Global Banking and Global Markets , decreased 35 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily driven by lower equity issuance and debt issuance fees, partially offset by higher advisory fees. 15 Bank of America Global Markets Three Months Ended March 31 (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 % Change Net interest income $ 993 $ 990 % Noninterest income: Investment and brokerage services 545 560 (3) Investment banking fees 582 981 (41) Market making and similar activities 3,190 3,470 (8) All other income (18) 197 (109) Total noninterest income 4,299 5,208 (17) Total revenue, net of interest expense 5,292 6,198 (15) Provision for credit losses 5 (5) n/m Noninterest expense 3,117 3,427 (9) Income before income taxes 2,170 2,776 (22) Income tax expense 575 722 (20) Net income $ 1,595 $ 2,054 (22) Effective tax rate 26.5 % 26.0 % Return on average allocated capital 15 22 Efficiency ratio 58.90 55.29 Balance Sheet Three Months Ended March 31 2022 2021 % Change Average Trading-related assets: Trading account securities $ 301,285 $ 265,181 14 % Reverse repurchases 138,581 99,886 39 Securities borrowed 114,468 89,253 28 Derivative assets 41,820 47,469 (12) Total trading-related assets 596,154 501,789 19 Total loans and leases 108,576 77,415 40 Total earning assets 610,926 495,324 23 Total assets 858,719 723,264 19 Total deposits 44,393 53,852 (18) Allocated capital 42,500 38,000 12 Period end March 31 2022 December 31 2021 % Change Total trading-related assets $ 616,811 $ 491,160 26 % Total loans and leases 110,037 114,846 (4) Total earning assets 609,290 561,135 9 Total assets 883,304 747,794 18 Total deposits 43,371 46,374 (6) n/m = not meaningful Global Markets offers sales and trading services and research services to institutional clients across fixed-income, credit, currency, commodity and equity businesses. Global Markets product coverage includes securities and derivative products in both the primary and secondary markets. For more information about Global Markets , see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following explanations for current period-over-period changes for Global Markets , including those disclosed under Sales and Trading Revenue, are the same for amounts including and excluding net DVA. Amounts excluding net DVA are a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information on net DVA, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 5. Net income for Global Markets decreased $459 million to $1.6 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. Net DVA gains were $69 million compared to losses of $2 million in 2021. Excluding net DVA, net income decreased $513 million to $1.5 billion. These decreases were primarily driven by lower revenue, partially offset by lower noninterest expense. Revenue decreased $906 million to $5.3 billion primarily driven by lower investment banking fees and sales and trading revenue. Sales and trading revenue decreased $359 million, and excluding net DVA, decreased $430 million. These decreases were driven by lower revenue in FICC, partially offset by higher revenue in Equities. Noninterest expense decreased $310 million to 3.1 billion primarily driven by the realignment of a liquidating business activity from Global Markets to All Other in the fourth quarter of 2021. In addition, the prior-year period included an acceleration of expenses from incentive compensation award changes. Average total assets increased $135.5 billion to $858.7 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to same period in 2021 driven by higher levels of inventory and loan growth in FICC as well as higher client balances in Equities. Period-end total assets increased $135.5 billion from December 31, 2021 to $883.3 billion driven by higher levels of inventory in FICC and increased hedging of client activity with stock positions relative to derivatives in Equities. Bank of America 16 The return on average allocated capital was 15 percent, down from 22 percent, reflecting lower net income and an increase in allocated capital. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 9. Sales and Trading Revenue For a description of sales and trading revenue, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The table below and related discussion present sales and trading revenue, substantially all of which is in Global Markets, with the remainder in Global Banking . In addition, the following table and related discussion present sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information on net DVA, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 5. Sales and Trading Revenue (1, 2, 3) Three Months Ended March 31 (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Sales and trading revenue Fixed income, currencies and commodities $ 2,708 $ 3,242 Equities 2,011 1,836 Total sales and trading revenue $ 4,719 $ 5,078 Sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA (4) Fixed income, currencies and commodities $ 2,648 $ 3,251 Equities 2,002 1,829 Total sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA $ 4,650 $ 5,080 (1) For more information on sales and trading revenue, see Note 3 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) Includes FTE adjustments of $93 million and $73 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021. (3) Includes Global Banking sales and trading revenue of $179 million and $104 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021. (4) FICC and Equities sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, is a non-GAAP financial measure. FICC net DVA gains (losses) were $60 million and $(9) million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021. Equities net DVA gains were $9 million and $7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021. FICC revenue decreased $603 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 driven by gains in commodities in the prior-year period for a weather-related event and a weaker trading environment for credit products in the current-year period, partially offset by improved performance across macro products. Equities revenue increased $173 million driven by increased client activity and a strong trading performance in derivatives. All Other Three Months Ended March 31 (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 % Change Net interest income $ (7) $ 87 (108) % Noninterest income (loss) (1,434) (1,026) 40 Total revenue, net of interest expense (1,441) (939) 53 Provision for credit losses (47) (47) Noninterest expense 583 308 89 Loss before income taxes (1,977) (1,200) 65 Income tax benefit (1,613) (1,456) 11 Net income (loss) $ (364) $ 256 n/m Balance Sheet Three Months Ended March 31 Average 2022 2021 % Change Total loans and leases $ 15,405 $ 20,815 (26) % Total assets (1) 154,425 207,449 (26) Total deposits 20,504 14,354 43 Period end March 31 2022 December 31 2021 % Change Total loans and leases $ 15,090 $ 15,863 (5) % Total assets (1) 132,186 214,153 (38) Total deposits 20,990 21,182 (1) (1) In segments where the total of liabilities and equity exceeds assets, which are generally deposit-taking segments, we allocate assets from All Other to those segments to match liabilities (i.e., deposits) and allocated shareholders equity. Average allocated assets were $1.2 trillion and $1.0 trillion for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, and period-end allocated assets were $1.2 trillion at both March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. n/m = not meaningful 17 Bank of America All Other primarily consists of ALM activities, liquidating businesses and certain expenses not otherwise allocated to a business segment. ALM activities encompass interest rate and foreign currency risk management activities for which substantially all of the results are allocated to our business segments. For more information on our ALM activities, see Note 17 Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Net income decreased $620 million to a loss of $364 million due to lower revenue and higher noninterest expense. Revenue decreased $502 million primarily due to higher partnership losses for ESG investments. Noninterest expense increased $275 million primarily due to the realignment of a liquidating business activity from Global Markets to All Other in the fourth quarter of 2021. The income tax benefit increased $157 million primarily reflecting increased tax preference benefits related to ESG investment activity. Both periods included income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking . Managing Risk Risk is inherent in all our business activities. The seven key types of risk faced by the Corporation are strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational. Sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver for our shareholders. If not managed well, risk can result in financial loss, regulatory sanctions and penalties, and damage to our reputation, each of which may adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategies. We take a comprehensive approach to risk management with a defined Risk Framework and an articulated Risk Appetite Statement, which are approved annually by the Enterprise Risk Committee and the Board. Our Risk Framework serves as the foundation for the consistent and effective management of risks facing the Corporation. The Risk Framework sets forth roles and responsibilities for the management of risk and provides a blueprint for how the Board, through delegation of authority to committees and executive officers, establishes risk appetite and associated limits for our activities. Our risk appetite provides a common set of measures for senior management and the Board to clearly indicate the level of risk we are willing to take in alignment with our strategic and capital plans and ensure that the Corporation risk profile remains aligned with our risk appetite. Our risk appetite is formally articulated in the Risk Appetite Statement, which includes both qualitative components and quantitative limits that are reviewed and approved by the Board at least annually. For more information about the Corporation risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic (the pandemic), see Item 1A. Risk Factors Coronavirus Disease of the Corporation 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. These pandemic-related risks are being managed within our Risk Framework and supporting risk management programs. For more information on our Risk Framework, our risk management activities and the key types of risk faced by the Corporation, see the Managing Risk section in the MD&A of the Corporation 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Capital Management The Corporation manages its capital position so that its capital is more than adequate to support its business activities and aligns with risk, risk appetite and strategic planning. For more information, including related regulatory requirements, see Capital Management in the MD&A of the Corporation 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. CCAR and Capital Planning The Federal Reserve requires BHCs to submit a capital plan and planned capital actions on an annual basis, consistent with the rules governing the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) capital plan. Based on the results of our 2021 CCAR capital plan and related supervisory stress tests, we are subject to a 2.5 percent stress capital buffer (SCB) from October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022. Our Common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio under the Standardized approach must remain above 9.5 percent during this period in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. In April 2022, we submitted our 2022 CCAR capital plan and related supervisory stress tests. The Federal Reserve will disclose CCAR capital plan supervisory stress test results by June 30, 2022. In October 2021, the Board renewed the Corporation $25 billion common stock repurchase program previously announced in April 2021. The Board authorization replaced the previous program. As with the April authorization, the Board also authorized common stock repurchases to offset shares awarded under the Corporation equity-based compensation plans. Pursuant to the Board authorizations, during the first quarter of 2022, we repurchased $2.6 billion of common stock, including repurchases to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans. The timing and amount of common stock repurchases are subject to various factors, including the Corporation capital position, liquidity, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock trading price, regulatory requirements and general market conditions, and may be suspended at any time. Such repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including repurchase plans that satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). Regulatory Capital As a financial services holding company, we are subject to regulatory capital rules, including Basel 3, issued by U.S. banking regulators. The Corporation's depository institution subsidiaries are also subject to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. The Corporation and its primary affiliated banking entity, BANA, are Advanced approaches institutions under Basel 3 and are required to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and risk-weighted assets (RWA) under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is used to assess capital adequacy, including under the PCA framework. As of March 31, 2022, the CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios for the Corporation were lower under the Standardized approach. Minimum Capital Requirements In order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments, the Corporation must meet risk-based capital ratio requirements that include a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent (under the Advanced approaches only), an SCB (under the Standardized approach only), plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer and a global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge. The buffers and surcharge must be comprised solely of CET1 capital. The Corporation's CET1 capital ratio must be a minimum of 9.5 percent under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. Bank of America 18 The Corporation is required to calculate its G-SIB surcharge on an annual basis under two methods and is subject to the higher of the resulting two surcharges. Method 1 is consistent with the approach prescribed by the Basel Committee assessment methodology and is calculated using specified indicators of systemic importance. Method 2 modifies the Method 1 approach by, among other factors, including a measure of the Corporation reliance on short-term wholesale funding. The Corporation G-SIB surcharge, which is higher under Method 2, is expected to increase to 3.0 percent on January 1, 2024 unless its surcharge calculated as of December 31, 2022 is lower than 3.0 percent. The current SCB of 2.5 percent, which remains effective from October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022, could change based on results of the 2022 CCAR capital plan and related supervisory stress tests that we submitted in April 2022. The Corporation is also required to maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Our insured depository institution subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be considered well capitalized under the PCA framework. Capital Composition and Ratios Table 7 presents Bank of America Corporation capital ratios and related information in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced approaches as measured at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. For the periods presented herein, the Corporation met the definition of well capitalized under current regulatory requirements. Table 7 Bank of America Corporation Regulatory Capital under Basel 3 Standardized Approach (1) Advanced Approaches (1) Regulatory Minimum (2) (Dollars in millions, except as noted) March 31, 2022 Risk-based capital metrics: Common equity tier 1 capital $ 169,874 $ 169,874 Tier 1 capital 197,007 197,007 Total capital (3) 229,186 222,481 Risk-weighted assets (in billions) 1,639 1,416 Common equity tier 1 capital ratio 10.4 % 12.0 % 9.5 % Tier 1 capital ratio 12.0 13.9 11.0 Total capital ratio 14.0 15.7 13.0 Leverage-based metrics: Adjusted quarterly average assets (in billions) (4) $ 3,130 $ 3,130 Tier 1 leverage ratio 6.3 % 6.3 % 4.0 Supplementary leverage exposure (in billions) $ 3,662 Supplementary leverage ratio 5.4 % 5.0 December 31, 2021 Risk-based capital metrics: Common equity tier 1 capital $ 171,759 $ 171,759 Tier 1 capital 196,465 196,465 Total capital (3) 227,592 220,616 Risk-weighted assets (in billions) 1,618 1,399 Common equity tier 1 capital ratio 10.6 % 12.3 % 9.5 % Tier 1 capital ratio 12.1 14.0 11.0 Total capital ratio 14.1 15.8 13.0 Leverage-based metrics: Adjusted quarterly average assets (in billions) (4) $ 3,087 $ 3,087 Tier 1 leverage ratio 6.4 % 6.4 % 4.0 Supplementary leverage exposure (in billions) $ 3,604 Supplementary leverage ratio 5.5 % 5.0 (1) Capital ratios as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 are calculated using the regulatory capital rule that allows a five-year transition period related to the adoption of the current expected credit losses (CECL) accounting standard. (2) The capital conservation buffer and G-SIB surcharge were 2.5 percent at both March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. At both March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Corporation's SCB of 2.5 percent was applied in place of the capital conservation buffer under the Standardized approach. The countercyclical capital buffer for both periods was zero. The CET1 capital regulatory minimum is the sum of the CET1 capital ratio minimum of 4.5 percent, our G-SIB surcharge of 2.5 percent and our SCB or the capital conservation buffer, as applicable, of 2.5 percent. The SLR regulatory minimum includes a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent. (3) Total capital under the Advanced approaches differs from the Standardized approach due to differences in the amount permitted in Tier 2 capital related to the qualifying allowance for credit losses. (4) Reflects total average assets adjusted for certain Tier 1 capital deductions. 19 Bank of America At March 31, 2022, CET1 capital was $169.9 billion, a decrease of $1.9 billion from December 31, 2021, driven by common stock repurchases, dividends and increases in net unrealized losses on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities included in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI), partially offset by earnings. Tier 1 capital increased $542 million primarily driven by non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock issuances, partially offset by the same factors as CET1 capital. Total capital under the Standardized approach increased $1.6 billion primarily driven by the same factors driving the increase in Tier 1 capital, subordinated debt issuances and an increase in the adjusted allowance for credit losses included in Tier 2 capital. RWA under the Standardized approach, which yielded the lower CET1 capital ratio at March 31, 2022, increased $21.1 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2022 to $1,639 billion primarily due to loan growth and client activity in Global Markets . Supplementary leverage exposure at March 31, 2022 increased $58.1 billion primarily due to on and off-balance sheet growth in Global Markets . Table 8 shows the capital composition at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

(2) Risk-based capital regulatory minimums at both March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 are the minimum ratios under Basel 3 including a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent. The regulatory minimums for the leverage ratios as of both period ends are the percent required to be considered well capitalized under the PCA framework. (3) Total capital under the Advanced approaches differs from the Standardized approach due to differences in the amount permitted in Tier 2 capital related to the qualifying allowance for credit losses. (4) Reflects total average assets adjusted for certain Tier 1 capital deductions. Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity Requirements Total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) consists of the Corporation Tier 1 capital and eligible long-term debt issued directly by the Corporation. Eligible long-term debt for TLAC ratios is comprised of unsecured debt that has a remaining maturity of at least one year and satisfies additional requirements as prescribed in the TLAC final rule. As with the risk-based capital ratios and SLR, the Corporation is required to maintain TLAC ratios in excess of minimum requirements plus applicable buffers to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Table 11 presents the Corporation's TLAC and long-term debt ratios and related information as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 21 Bank of America Table 11 Bank of America Corporation Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity and Long-Term Debt TLAC (1) Regulatory Minimum (2) Long-term Debt Regulatory Minimum (3) (Dollars in millions) March 31, 2022 Total eligible balance $ 445,385 $ 236,828 Percentage of risk-weighted assets (4) 27.2 % 22.0 % 14.4 % 8.5 % Percentage of supplementary leverage exposure 12.2 9.5 6.5 4.5 December 31, 2021 Total eligible balance $ 435,904 $ 227,714 Percentage of risk-weighted assets (4) 26.9 % 22.0 % 14.1 % 8.5 % Percentage of supplementary leverage exposure 12.1 9.5 6.3 4.5 (1) As of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, TLAC ratios are calculated using the regulatory capital rule that allows a five-year transition period related to the adoption of CECL. (2) The TLAC RWA regulatory minimum consists of 18.0 percent plus a TLAC RWA buffer comprised of 2.5 percent plus the Method 1 G-SIB surcharge of 1.5 percent. The countercyclical buffer is zero for both periods. The TLAC supplementary leverage exposure regulatory minimum consists of 7.5 percent plus a 2.0 percent TLAC leverage buffer. The TLAC RWA and leverage buffers must be comprised solely of CET1 capital and Tier 1 capital, respectively. (3) The long-term debt RWA regulatory minimum is comprised of 6.0 percent plus an additional 2.5 percent requirement based on the Corporation Method 2 G-SIB surcharge. The long-term debt leverage exposure regulatory minimum is 4.5 percent. (4) The approach that yields the higher RWA is used to calculate TLAC and long-term debt ratios, which was the Standardized approach as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Regulatory Developments For information on regulatory developments, see Capital Management Regulatory Developments in the MD&A of the Corporation 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Regulatory Capital and Securities Regulation The Corporation principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are BofA Securities, Inc. (BofAS), Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp. (MLPCC) and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (MLPF&S). The Corporation's principal European broker-dealer subsidiaries are Merrill Lynch International (MLI) and BofA Securities Europe SA (BofASE). The U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the net capital requirements of Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act. BofAS computes its minimum capital requirements as an alternative net capital broker-dealer under Rule 15c3-1e, and MLPCC and MLPF&S compute their minimum capital requirements in accordance with the alternative standard under Rule 15c3-1. BofAS and MLPCC are also registered as futures commission merchants and are subject to Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Regulation 1.17. The U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are also registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA). Pursuant to FINRA Rule 4110, FINRA may impose higher net capital requirements than Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act with respect to each of the broker-dealers. BofAS provides institutional services, and in accordance with the alternative net capital requirements, is required to maintain tentative net capital in excess of $5.0 billion and net capital in excess of the greater of $1.0 billion or a certain percentage of its reserve requirement in addition to a certain percentage of securities-based swap risk margin. BofAS must also notify the SEC in the event its tentative net capital is less than $6.0 billion. BofAS is also required to hold a certain percentage of its customers' and affiliates' risk-based margin in order to meet its CFTC minimum net capital requirement. At March 31, 2022, BofAS had tentative net capital of $17.2 billion. BofAS also had regulatory net capital of $14.4 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement of $4.0 billion. MLPCC is a fully-guaranteed subsidiary of BofAS and provides clearing and settlement services as well as prime brokerage and arranged financing services for institutional clients. At March 31, 2022, MLPCC regulatory net capital of $7.7 billion exceeded the minimum requirement of $1.4 billion. MLPF&S provides retail services. At March 31, 2022, MLPF&S' regulatory net capital was $6.0 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement of $183 million. Our European broker-dealers are subject to requirements from U.S. and non-U.S. regulators. MLI, a U.K. investment firm, is regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. At March 31, 2022, MLI capital resources were $33.5 billion, which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $13.3 billion. BofASE, a French investment firm, is regulated by the Autorit de Contr le Prudentiel et de R solution and the Autorit des March Financiers, and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. At March 31, 2022, BofASE's capital resources were $7.6 billion, which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $3.3 billion. In addition, MLI and BofASE became conditionally registered with the SEC as security-based swap dealers in the fourth quarter of 2021, and maintained net liquid assets at March 31, 2022 that exceeded the applicable minimum requirements under the Exchange Act. Liquidity Risk Funding and Liquidity Risk Management Our primary liquidity risk management objective is to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral requirements, including payments under long-term debt agreements, commitments to extend credit and customer deposit withdrawals, while continuing to support our businesses and customers under a range of economic conditions. To achieve that objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk under expected and stressed conditions, maintain liquidity and access to diverse funding sources, including our stable deposit base, and seek to align liquidity-related incentives and risks. These liquidity risk management practices have allowed us to effectively manage the market fluctuation from the pandemic. For more information on the risks of the pandemic, see Item 1A. Risk Factors Coronavirus Disease of the Corporation 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. We define liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we can use to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations as they arise. We manage our liquidity position through line-of-business and ALM activities, as well as through our legal entity funding strategy, on both a forward and current (including intraday) basis under both expected and stressed conditions. We believe that a centralized approach to funding and liquidity management enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding sources, minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to Bank of America 22 liquidity events. For more information regarding global funding and liquidity risk management, as well as liquidity sources, liquidity arrangements, contingency planning and credit ratings discussed below, see Liquidity Risk in the MD&A of the Corporation 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. NB Holdings Corporation The parent company, which is a separate and distinct legal entity from our bank and nonbank subsidiaries, has an intercompany arrangement with our wholly-owned holding company subsidiary, NB Holdings Corporation (NB Holdings). We have transferred, and agreed to transfer, additional parent company assets not required to satisfy anticipated near-term expenditures to NB Holdings. The parent company is expected to continue to have access to the same flow of dividends, interest and other amounts of cash necessary to service its debt, pay dividends and perform other obligations as it would have had it not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets. These arrangements support our preferred single point of entry resolution strategy, under which only the parent company would be resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Global Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets Table 12 presents average Global Liquidity Sources (GLS) for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Table 12 Average Global Liquidity Sources Three Months Ended (Dollars in billions) March 31 2022 December 31 2021 Bank entities $ 957 $ 1,006 Nonbank and other entities (1) 152 152 Total Average Global Liquidity Sources $ 1,109 $ 1,158 (1) Nonbank includes Parent, NB Holdings and other regulated entities. Our bank subsidiaries liquidity is primarily driven by deposit and lending activity, as well as securities valuation and net debt activity. Bank subsidiaries can also generate incremental liquidity by pledging a range of unencumbered loans and securities to certain Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against this pool of specifically-identified eligible assets was $339 billion and $322 billion at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. We have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against these assets, including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loans and securities collateral. Eligibility is defined in guidelines from the FHLBs and the Federal Reserve and is subject to change at their discretion. Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries can generally be used only to fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries, and transfers to the parent company or nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to prior regulatory approval. Liquidity is also held in nonbank entities, including the parent, NB Holdings and other regulated entities. The parent company and NB Holdings liquidity is typically in the form of cash deposited at BANA, which is excluded from the liquidity at bank subsidiaries, and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Liquidity held in other regulated entities, comprised primarily of broker-dealer subsidiaries, is primarily available to meet the obligations of that entity, and transfers to the parent company or to any other subsidiary may be subject to prior regulatory approval due to regulatory restrictions and minimum requirements. Our other regulated entities also hold unencumbered investment-grade securities and equities that we believe could be used to generate additional liquidity. Table 13 presents the composition of average GLS for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Table 13 Average Global Liquidity Sources Composition Three Months Ended (Dollars in billions) March 31 2022 December 31 2021 Cash on deposit $ 243 $ 259 U.S. Treasury securities 265 278 U.S. agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, and other investment-grade securities 585 606 Non-U.S. government securities 16 15 Total Average Global Liquidity Sources $ 1,109 $ 1,158 Our GLS are substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the final U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) rules. However, HQLA for purposes of calculating LCR is not reported at market value, but at a lower value that incorporates regulatory deductions and the exclusion of excess liquidity held at certain subsidiaries. The LCR is calculated as the amount of a financial institution unencumbered HQLA relative to the estimated net cash outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period of significant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. Our average consolidated HQLA, on a net basis, was $616 billion and $617 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. For the same periods, the average consolidated LCR was 116 percent and 115 percent. Our LCR fluctuates due to normal business flows from customer activity. Liquidity Stress Analysis We utilize liquidity stress analysis to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our subsidiaries to meet contractual and contingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios. For more information on liquidity stress analysis, see Liquidity Risk Liquidity Stress Analysis in the MD&A of the Corporation 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Net Stable Funding Ratio The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is a liquidity requirement for large banks to maintain a minimum level of stable funding over a one-year period. The requirement is intended to support the ability of banks to lend to households and businesses in both normal and adverse economic conditions and is complementary to the LCR, which focuses on short-term liquidity risks. The U.S. NSFR applies to the Corporation on a consolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions. At March 31, 2022, the Corporation and its insured depository institutions were in compliance with this requirement. Diversified Funding Sources We fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits, and secured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally coordinated funding approach diversified across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups. We fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposits, which totaled $2.1 trillion at both March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 23 Bank of America Our trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded on a secured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements, and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions. Long-term Debt During the three months ended March 31, 2022, we issued $21.1 billion of long-term debt consisting of $17.2 billion of notes issued by Bank of America Corporation, substantially all of which was TLAC compliant, $546 million of notes issued by Bank of America, N.A. and $3.4 billion of other debt, which is primarily structured liabilities. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, we had total long-term debt maturities and redemptions in the aggregate of $8.2 billion consisting of $4.8 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $2.3 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $1.1 billion of other debt. Table 14 presents the carrying value of aggregate annual contractual maturities of long-term debt at March 31, 2022.

For more information on our TLAC eligible and callable outstanding notes, see Liquidity Risk Diversified Funding Sources in the MD&A of the Corporation 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. (2) Represents liabilities of consolidated variable interest entities (VIEs) included in total long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Total long-term debt decreased $1.4 billion to $278.7 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily due to debt valuation adjustments, maturities and redemptions, partially offset by debt issuances. We may, from time to time, purchase outstanding debt instruments in various transactions, depending on market conditions, liquidity and other factors. Our other regulated entities may also make markets in our debt instruments to provide liquidity for investors. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, we issued $2.7 billion of structured notes, which are debt obligations that pay investors returns linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. These structured notes are typically issued to meet client demand, and notes with certain attributes may also be TLAC eligible. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these liabilities with derivatives and/or investments in the underlying instruments, so that from a funding perspective, the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We could be required to settle certain structured note obligations for cash or other securities prior to maturity under certain circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning purposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date. Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price. For more information on long-term debt funding, including issuances and maturities and redemptions, see Note 11 Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. We use derivative transactions to manage the duration, interest rate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering the characteristics of the assets they are funding. For more information on our ALM activities, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 41. Credit Ratings Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating agencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other securities, including asset securitizations. Table 15 presents the Corporation current long-term/short-term senior debt ratings and outlooks expressed by the rating agencies. The ratings from Moody's Investors Service, Standard & Poor Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings for the Corporation and its subsidiaries have not changed from those disclosed in the Corporation's 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Representations and Warranties Obligations For information on representations and warranties obligations in connection with the sale of mortgage loans, see Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Credit Risk Management For information on our credit risk management activities, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management below, Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 30, Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 36, Allowance for Credit Losses on page 37, and Note 5 Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, asset quality continued to improve. Consumer net charge-offs remained near historic lows and commercial non-performing loans and reservable criticized utilized exposure decreased, which was partially offset by an increase in reservable criticized exposure associated with our direct exposure to Russia as a result of the Russia/Ukraine conflict. While there have been signs of relief from the pandemic, uncertainty remains about the timing and strength of the economy recovery, which could be hampered by broader economic impacts as a result of the current geopolitical situation, supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures and could lead to adverse impacts to credit quality metrics in future periods. Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Credit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower credit cycle. Statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio management including underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting credit limits, and establishing operating processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns. Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources such as credit bureaus and/or internal historical experience and are a component of our consumer credit risk management process. These models are used in part to assist in making both new and ongoing credit decisions, as well as portfolio management strategies, including authorizations and line management, collection practices and strategies, and determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allocated capital for credit risk. Consumer Credit Portfolio During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the U.S. unemployment rate continued to decline and home prices increased. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, net charge-offs decreased $353 million to $340 million primarily driven by lower credit card losses, as loss rates remained near historic lows. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, nonperforming loans increased primarily due to loans with expired payment deferrals that were modified as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) during the quarter. The consumer allowance for loan and lease losses decreased $318 million during the three months ended March 31, 2022 to $6.7 billion. For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 37. For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, charge-offs and TDRs for the consumer portfolio, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 5 Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 25 Bank of America Table 16 presents our outstanding consumer loans and leases, consumer nonperforming loans and accruing consumer loans past due 90 days or more.

At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, residential mortgage includes $468 million and $444 million of loans on which interest had been curtailed by the Federal Housing Administration, and therefore were no longer accruing interest, although principal was still insured, and $106 million and $190 million of loans on which interest was still accruing. (2) Outstandings primarily include auto and specialty lending loans and leases of $49.7 billion and $48.5 billion, U.S. securities-based lending loans of $51.9 billion and $51.1 billion and non-U.S. consumer loans of $3.2 billion and $3.0 billion at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

As a result, in the following tables and discussions of the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios, we exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option and provide information that excludes the impact of the fully-insured loan portfolio in certain credit quality statistics. Residential Mortgage The residential mortgage portfolio made up the largest percentage of our consumer loan portfolio at 52 percent of consumer loans and leases at March 31, 2022. Approximately 51 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio was in Consumer Banking and 43 percent was in GWIM. The remaining portion was in All Other . Outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio increased $4.1 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2022 as originations were partially offset by paydowns. At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the residential mortgage portfolio included $12.4 billion and $12.7 billion of outstanding fully-insured loans, of which $2.1 billion and $2.2 billion had Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insurance, with the remainder protected by Fannie Mae long-term standby agreements. Table 18 presents certain residential mortgage key credit statistics on both a reported basis and excluding the fully-insured loan portfolio. The following discussion presents the residential mortgage portfolio excluding the fully-insured loan portfolio.

(2) Includes loans that are contractually current which primarily consist of collateral-dependent TDRs, including those that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy and loans that have not yet demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance following a TDR. Nonperforming outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio increased $138 million during the three months ended March 31, 2022 primarily due to loans with expired payment deferrals that were modified as TDRs during the quarter. Of the nonperforming residential mortgage loans at March 31, 2022, $1.4 billion, or 59 percent, were current on contractual payments. Loans accruing past due 30 days or more decreased $154 million. Net recoveries of $10 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 remained relatively unchanged compared to the same period in 2021. Of the $213.6 billion in total residential mortgage loans outstanding at March 31, 2022, 27 percent were originated as interest-only loans. The outstanding balance of interest-only residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period was $4.5 billion, or eight percent, at March 31, 2022. Residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period generally experienced a higher rate of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status compared to the residential mortgage portfolio as a whole. At March 31, 2022, $37 million, or one percent, of outstanding interest-only residential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $712 million or less than one percent, for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, at March 31, 2022, $264 million, or six percent, of outstanding interest-only residential mortgage loans that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming, of which $98 million were contractually current. Loans that have yet to enter the amortization period in our interest-only residential mortgage portfolio are primarily well-collateralized loans to our wealth management clients and have an interest-only period of three to ten years. Approximately 93 percent of these loans that have yet to enter the amortization period will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2025 or later. Table 19 presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the residential mortgage portfolio. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) within California represented 14 percent and 15 percent of outstandings at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 15 percent of outstandings at both March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

Home Equity At March 31, 2022, the home equity portfolio made up six percent of the consumer portfolio and was comprised of home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), home equity loans and reverse mortgages. HELOCs generally have an initial draw period of 10 years, and after the initial draw period ends, the loans generally convert to 15- or 20-year amortizing loans. We no longer originate home equity loans or reverse mortgages. At March 31, 2022, 80 percent of the home equity portfolio was in Consumer Banking , 11 percent was in All Other and the remainder of the portfolio was primarily in GWIM . Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased $1.0 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2022 primarily due to paydowns outpacing draws on existing lines and new originations. Of the total home equity portfolio at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, $11.8 billion and $12.2 billion, or 44 percent, were in first-lien positions. At March 31, 2022, outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio that were in a second-lien or more junior-lien position and where we also held the first-lien loan totaled $4.5 billion, or 17 percent of our total home equity portfolio. 27 Bank of America Unused HELOCs totaled $40.9 billion and $40.5 billion at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The HELOC utilization rate was 38 percent and 39 percent at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Table 20 presents certain home equity portfolio key credit statistics. Table 20 Home Equity Key Credit Statistics (1) (Dollars in millions) March 31 2022 December 31 2021 Outstandings $ 26,936 $ 27,935 Accruing past due 30 days or more 111 157 Nonperforming loans (2) 615 630 Percent of portfolio Refreshed CLTV greater than 90 but less than or equal to 100 % % Refreshed CLTV greater than 100 1 1 Refreshed FICO below 620 3 3 (1) Outstandings, accruing past due, nonperforming loans and percentages of the portfolio exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. (2) Includes loans that are contractually current which primarily consist of collateral-dependent TDRs, including those that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, junior-lien loans where the underlying first lien is 90 days or more past due, as well as loans that have not yet demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance following a TDR. Nonperforming outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio remained relatively flat at $615 million during the three months ended March 31, 2022. Of the nonperforming home equity loans at March 31, 2022, $256 million, or 42 percent, were current on contractual payments. In addition, $228 million, or 37 percent of nonperforming home equity loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell. Accruing loans that were 30 days or more past due decreased $46 million during the three months ended March 31, 2022. Net recoveries decreased $5 million to $30 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. Of the $26.9 billion in total home equity portfolio outstandings at March 31, 2022, as shown in Table 20, 14 percent require interest-only payments. The outstanding balance of HELOCs that have reached the end of their draw period and have entered the amortization period was $6.3 billion at March 31, 2022. The HELOCs that have entered the amortization period have experienced a higher percentage of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status when compared to the HELOC portfolio as a whole. At March 31, 2022, $71 million, or one percent, of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more. In addition, at March 31, 2022, $455 million, or seven percent, were nonperforming. For our interest-only HELOC portfolio, we do not actively track how many of our home equity customers pay only the minimum amount due on their home equity loans and lines; however, we can infer some of this information through a review of our HELOC portfolio that we service and is still in its revolving period. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, 18 percent of these customers with an outstanding balance did not pay any principal on their HELOCs. Table 21 presents outstandings, nonperforming balances and net recoveries by certain state concentrations for the home equity portfolio. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 13 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California made up 11 percent and 10 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

Credit Card At March 31, 2022, 97 percent of the credit card portfolio was managed in Consumer Banking with the remainder in GWIM . Outstandings in the credit card portfolio decreased $2.1 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2022 to $79.4 billion primarily driven by the transfer of a $1.6 billion affinity card loan portfolio to held for sale in anticipation of its sale later in 2022. Net charge-offs decreased $337 million to $297 million during the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 as loss rates remained near historic lows. In addition, the prior-year period included charge-offs associated with deferrals that expired in 2020. Credit card loans 30 days and 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest remained relatively flat at $1.0 billion and $492 million at March 31, 2022. Unused lines of credit for credit card decreased to $357.1 billion at March 31, 2022 from $361.2 billion at December 31, 2021.

Outstandings in the direct/indirect portfolio increased by $2.2 billion at March 31, 2022 to $105.8 billion driven by growth in our auto portfolio and client demand for liquidity in securities-based lending. Table 23 presents certain state concentrations for the direct/indirect consumer loan portfolio.

During the three months ended March 31, 2022, nonperforming consumer loans increased $115 million to $3.1 billion primarily due to loans with expired payment deferrals that were modified in TDRs during the quarter. At March 31, 2022, $836 million, or 27 percent of nonperforming loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to their estimated property value less costs to sell. In addition, at March 31, 2022, $1.7 billion, or 56 percent of nonperforming consumer loans were modified and are now current after successful trial periods, or are current loans classified as nonperforming loans in accordance with applicable policies. Foreclosed properties increased $17 million during the three months ended March 31, 2022 to $118 million. Nonperforming loans also include certain loans that have been modified in TDRs where economic concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. 29 Bank of America Table 24 Nonperforming Consumer Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity Three Months Ended March 31 (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Nonperforming loans and leases, January 1 $ 2,989 $ 2,725 Additions 644 851 Reductions: Paydowns and payoffs (175) (123) Sales (131) (1) Returns to performing status (1) (202) (347) Charge-offs (15) (12) Transfers to foreclosed properties (6) (2) Total net additions to nonperforming loans and leases 115 366 Total nonperforming loans and leases, March 31 3,104 3,091 Foreclosed properties, March 31 (2) 118 101 Nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties, March 31 $ 3,222 $ 3,192 Nonperforming consumer loans and leases as a percentage of outstanding consumer loans and leases (3) 0.71 % 0.75 % Nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties as a percentage of outstanding consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties (3) 0.74 0.78 (1) Consumer loans may be returned to performing status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected, or when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection.

(2) At both March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, residential mortgage performing TDRs include $1.2 billion of loans that were fully-insured. (3) At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, home equity TDRs deemed collateral dependent totaled $383 million and $370 million, and include $243 million and $222 million of loans classified as nonperforming and $140 million and $148 million of loans classified as performing. In addition to modifying consumer real estate loans, we work with customers who are experiencing financial difficulty by modifying credit card and other consumer loans. Credit card and other consumer loan modifications generally involve a reduction in the customer interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months. Modifications of credit card and other consumer loans are made through programs utilizing direct customer contact, but may also utilize external programs. At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, our credit card and other consumer TDR portfolio was $646 million and $672 million, of which $572 million and $599 million were current or less than 30 days past due under the modified terms. Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Commercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal that concentrations of credit exposure continue to be aligned with our risk appetite. We review, measure and manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, customer relationship and loan size. We also review, measure and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property type. In addition, within our non-U.S. portfolio, we evaluate exposures by region and by country. Tables 30, 33 and 36 summarize our concentrations. We also utilize syndications of exposure to third parties, loan sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio. For more information on our industry concentrations, see Table 33 and Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Industry Concentrations on page 34. For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, net charge-offs and TDRs for the commercial portfolio, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Commercial Credit Portfolio During the three months ended March 31, 2022, commercial credit quality improved as charge-offs, nonperforming commercial loans and reservable criticized utilized exposure declined during this period. Due to the ongoing Russia/Ukraine conflict, all of the $759 million of direct exposure to Russian counterparties has been downgraded and reported as reservable criticized exposure, and expected credit losses have been incorporated into our estimate of the allowance for credit losses. Outstanding commercial loans and leases increased $10.9 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2022 due to growth in commercial and industrial, primarily in Global Banking . This increase was partially offset by lower U.S. small business commercial loans due to repayments of PPP loans by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the terms of the program. For more information on PPP loans, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Bank of America 30 Credit quality of commercial real estate borrowers continued to stabilize in many sectors as economies have continued to reopen and pandemic-impacted sectors continue to recover. However, many real estate markets, while improving, are still experiencing some disruptions in demand, supply chain challenges and tenant difficulties. Demand for office space is uncertain as companies evaluate space needs with employment models that utilize a mix of remote and conventional office use. The commercial allowance for loan and lease losses remained relatively flat at $5.4 billion, as asset quality improvements were offset by a reserve build related to Russian exposure and loan growth. For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 37. Total commercial utilized credit exposure increased $20.5 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2022 to $674.0 billion primarily driven by derivative assets and higher loans and leases. The utilization rate for loans and leases, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and financial guarantees, and commercial letters of credit, in the aggregate, was 55 percent at March 31, 2022 and 56 percent at December 31, 2021. Table 26 presents commercial credit exposure by type for utilized, unfunded and total binding committed credit exposure. Commercial utilized credit exposure includes SBLCs and financial guarantees and commercial letters of credit that have been issued and for which we are legally bound to advance funds under prescribed conditions during a specified time period, and excludes exposure related to trading account assets. Although funds have not yet been advanced, these exposure types are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes.

Table 29 presents commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure by loan type. Criticized exposure corresponds to the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful asset categories as defined by regulatory authorities. Total commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure decreased $1.7 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2022, which was broad-based across industries. At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, 86 percent and 87 percent of commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure was secured.

(2) Percentages are calculated as commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure divided by total commercial reservable utilized exposure for each exposure category. Commercial and Industrial Commercial and industrial loans include U.S. commercial and non-U.S. commercial portfolios. U.S. Commercial At March 31, 2022, 65 percent of the U.S. commercial loan portfolio, excluding small business, was managed in Global Banking, 19 percent in Global Markets , 15 percent in GWIM (loans that provide financing for asset purchases, business investments and other liquidity needs for high net worth clients) and the remainder primarily in Consumer Banking . U.S. commercial loans increased $5.0 billion, or two percent, during the three months ended March 31, 2022 primarily driven by Global Banking . Reservable criticized utilized exposure decreased $958 million, or eight percent, driven by decreases across a broad range of industries. Non-U.S. Commercial At March 31, 2022, 68 percent of the non-U.S. commercial loan portfolio was managed in Global Banking, 31 percent in Global Markets and the remainder in GWIM . Non-U.S. commercial loans increased $9.0 billion, or eight percent, during the three months ended March 31, 2022 primarily in Global Banking and Global Markets . Reservable criticized utilized exposure increased $598 million, or 23 percent, due to downgrades for direct exposure to Russian counterparties. For information on the non-U.S. commercial portfolio, see Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 36. For more information on the Russia/Ukraine conflict, see Recent Developments on page 3. Commercial Real Estate Commercial real estate primarily includes commercial loans secured by non-owner-occupied real estate and is dependent on the sale or lease of the real estate as the primary source of repayment. Outstanding loans decreased $476 million, or one percent, during the three months ended March 31, 2022 to $62.5 billion due to paydowns outpacing new originations. Reservable criticized utilized exposure decreased $1.3 billion, or 17 percent, primarily driven by Hotels due to improving vacancy rates and reduced travel restrictions. The portfolio remains diversified across property types and geographic regions. California represented the largest state concentration at 20 percent and 21 percent of the commercial real estate portfolio at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The commercial real estate portfolio is predominantly managed in Global Banking and consists of loans made primarily to public and private developers, and commercial real estate firms. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, we continued to see low default rates and varying degrees of improvement in certain geographic regions and property types of the portfolio. We use a number of proactive risk mitigation initiatives to reduce adversely rated exposure in the commercial real estate portfolio, including transfers of deteriorating exposures for management by independent special asset Bank of America 32 officers and the pursuit of loan restructurings or asset sales to achieve the best results for our customers and the Corporation. Table 30 presents outstanding commercial real estate loans by geographic region, based on the geographic location of the collateral, and by property type.

The decline of $1.7 billion in PPP loans during the three months ended March 31, 2022 was due to repayment of the loans by the SBA under the terms of the program. Excluding PPP, credit card-related products were 53 percent and 50 percent of the U.S. small business commercial portfolio at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 and represented all of the net charge-offs for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to 90 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2021. The increase of $234 million in accruing past due 90 days or more for the three months ended March 31, 2022 was driven by PPP loans, which are fully guaranteed by the SBA. Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity Table 31 presents the nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity during the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021. Nonperforming loans do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, nonperforming commercial loans and leases decreased $57 million to $1.5 billion. At March 31, 2022, 90 percent of commercial nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties were secured and 54 percent were contractually current. Commercial nonperforming loans were carried at 90 percent of their unpaid principal balance, as the carrying value of these loans has been reduced to the estimated collateral value less costs to sell. 33 Bank of America Table 31 Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity (1, 2) Three Months Ended March 31 (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Nonperforming loans and leases, January 1 $ 1,578 $ 2,227 Additions 183 472 Reductions: Paydowns (159) (312) Sales (25) (22) Returns to performing status (3) (5) (28) Charge-offs (12) (78) Transfers to loans held-for-sale (39) (188) Total net reductions to nonperforming loans and leases (57) (156) Total nonperforming loans and leases, March 31 1,521 2,071 Foreclosed properties, March 31 35 36 Nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties, March 31 $ 1,556 $ 2,107 Nonperforming commercial loans and leases as a percentage of outstanding commercial loans and leases (4) 0.28 % 0.43 % Nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties as a percentage of outstanding commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties (4) 0.28 0.43 (1) Balances do not include nonperforming loans held-for-sale of $336 million and $384 million at March 31, 2022 and 2021. (2) Includes U.S. small business commercial activity. Small business card loans are excluded as they are not classified as nonperforming. (3) Commercial loans and leases may be returned to performing status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected, or when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection. TDRs are generally classified as performing after a sustained period of demonstrated payment performance. (4) Outstanding commercial loans exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. Table 32 presents our commercial TDRs by product type and performing status. U.S. small business commercial TDRs are comprised of renegotiated small business card loans and small business loans. The renegotiated small business card loans are not classified as nonperforming as they are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due. Commercial TDRs increased $506 million, or 27 percent, during the three months ended March 31, 2022 primarily due to commercial real estate loans with expired payment deferrals that were modified as TDRs during the quarter.

For information on net notional credit protection purchased to hedge funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Risk Mitigation. Our commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. Total commercial committed exposure increased $37.4 billion, or three percent, during the three months ended March 31, 2022 to $1.2 trillion. The increase in commercial committed exposure was concentrated in Asset managers and funds and Materials. For information on industry limits, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Industry Concentrations in the MD&A of the Corporation 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Asset managers and funds, our largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $159.0 billion, increased $22.1 billion, or 16 percent, during the three months ended March 31, 2022, which was primarily driven by secured investment-grade exposures. Real estate, our second largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $93.9 billion, decreased $2.3 billion, or two percent, during the three months ended March 31, 2022. For more information on the commercial real estate and related portfolios, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Commercial Real Estate on page 32. Capital goods, our third largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $85.9 billion, increased $1.6 billion, or two percent during the three months ended March 31, 2022. While the U.S. and global economies have shown signs of relief from the pandemic, uncertainty remains as a result of geopolitical and inflationary pressures, and a number of industries will likely continue to be adversely impacted due to these conditions. We continue to monitor all industries, particularly higher risk industries that are experiencing or could experience a more significant impact to their financial condition.

The distributed amounts were $11.0 billion and $10.7 billion at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. (3) Industries are viewed from a variety of perspectives to best isolate the perceived risks. For purposes of this table, the real estate industry is defined based on the primary business activity of the borrowers or counterparties using operating cash flows and primary source of repayment as key factors. Risk Mitigation We purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. To lower the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, we may add credit exposure within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, was $3.4 billion and $2.6 billion. We recorded net losses of $9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to net losses of $36 million for same period in 2021. The gains and losses on these instruments were largely offset by gains and losses on the related exposures. The Value-at-Risk (VaR) results for these exposures are included in the fair value option portfolio information in Table 39. For more information, see Trading Risk Management on page 39.

Non-U.S. Portfolio Our non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios are subject to country risk. We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in government policies. A risk management framework is in place to measure, monitor and manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. In addition to the direct risk of doing business in a country, we also are exposed to indirect country risks (e.g., related to the collateral received on secured financing transactions or related to client clearing activities). These indirect exposures are managed in the normal course of business through credit, market and operational risk governance rather than through country risk governance. For more information on our non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios, see Non-U.S. Portfolio in the MD&A of the Corporation 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Table 36 presents our 20 largest non-U.S. country exposures at March 31, 2022. These exposures accounted for 90 percent and 89 percent of our total non-U.S. exposure at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Net country exposure for these 20 countries increased $36.9 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2022 primarily driven by increases in the United Kingdom, Japan and Germany, partially offset by reductions in Canada and Italy.

Our second largest non-U.S. country exposure was Germany with net exposure of $39.5 billion at March 31, 2022, a $5.7 billion increase from December 31, 2021. The increase in both of these countries was primarily driven by an increase in deposits with central banks. Bank of America 36 Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses decreased $360 million from December 31, 2021 to $13.5 billion at March 31, 2022, which included a $323 million reserve decrease related to the consumer portfolio and a $37 million reserve decrease related to the commercial portfolio. The decrease in the allowance was primarily driven by credit quality improvement, offset by a reserve build related to Russian exposure and loan growth. Table 37 presents an allocation of the allowance for credit losses by product type at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

The provision for credit losses increased $1.9 billion to an expense of $30 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. The allowance for credit losses had a reserve release of $360 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily driven by credit quality improvements. The provision for credit losses for the consumer portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, increased $770 million to an expense of $14 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. The provision for credit losses for the commercial portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, increased $1.1 billion to an expense of $16 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021.

Bank of America 38 Market Risk Management For more information on our market risk management process, see Market Risk Management in the MD&A of the Corporation 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions may adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities, or otherwise negatively impact earnings. This risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations, primarily within our Global Markets segment. We are also exposed to these risks in other areas of the Corporation (e.g., our ALM activities). In the event of market stress, these risks could have a material impact on our results. Trading Risk Management To evaluate risks in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of revenues generated by individual positions as well as portfolios of positions. VaR is a common statistic used to measure market risk. Our primary VaR statistic is equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level, which means that for a VaR with a one-day holding period, there should not be losses in excess of VaR, on average, 99 out of 100 trading days. Table 39 presents the total market-based portfolio VaR, which is the combination of the total covered positions (and less liquid trading positions) portfolio and the fair value option portfolio. For more information on the market risk VaR for trading activities, see Trading Risk Management in the MD&A of the Corporation 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The total market-based portfolio VaR results in Table 39 include market risk to which we are exposed from all business segments, excluding credit valuation adjustment (CVA), DVA and related hedges. The majority of this portfolio is within the Global Markets segment. Table 39 presents period-end, average, high and low daily trading VaR for the three months ended March 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2021 using a 99 percent confidence level. The amounts disclosed in Table 39 and Table 40 align to the view of covered positions used in the Basel 3 capital calculations. Foreign exchange and commodity positions are always considered covered positions, regardless of trading or banking treatment for the trade, except for structural foreign currency positions that are excluded with prior regulatory approval. The average of total covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio VaR increased for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the prior quarter primarily due to decreased diversification benefit across Equities and FICC and increased FX exposures through market making activities.

Therefore the impact from less liquid exposures and the amount of portfolio diversification, which is the difference between the total portfolio and the sum of the individual components, is not relevant. (2) Impact is net of diversification effects between the covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolios. The following graph presents the daily covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio VaR for the previous five quarters, corresponding to the data in Table 39. 39 Bank of America Additional VaR statistics produced within our single VaR model are provided in Table 40 at the same level of detail as in Table 39. Evaluating VaR with additional statistics allows for an increased understanding of the risks in the portfolio, as the historical market data used in the VaR calculation does not necessarily follow a predefined statistical distribution. Table 40 presents average trading VaR statistics at 99 percent and 95 percent confidence levels for the three months ended March 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2021.

For more information on our backtesting process, see Trading Risk Management Backtesting in the MD&A of the Corporation 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, there were no days where this subset of trading revenue had losses that exceeded our total covered portfolio VaR, utilizing a one-day holding period. Total Trading-related Revenue Total trading-related revenue, excluding brokerage fees, and CVA, DVA and funding valuation adjustment gains (losses), represents the total amount earned from trading positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. For more information, see Trading Risk Management Total Trading-related Revenue in the MD&A of the Corporation 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following histogram is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 100 percent of the trading days, of which 95 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million. This compares to the three months ended December 31, 2021 where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 92 percent of the trading days, of which 67 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million, and the largest loss was $45 million. Trading Portfolio Stress Testing Because the very nature of a VaR model suggests results can exceed our estimates and it is dependent on a limited historical window, we also stress test our portfolio using scenario analysis. This analysis estimates the change in the value of our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements. For more information, see Trading Risk Management Trading Portfolio Stress Testing in the MD&A of the Corporation 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Bank of America 40 Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book The following discussion presents net interest income for banking book activities. For more information, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book in the MD&A of the Corporation 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Table 41 presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Table 41 Forward Rates March 31, 2022 Federal Funds Three-month LIBOR 10-Year Swap Spot rates 0.50 % 0.96 % 2.41 % 12-month forward rates 3.00 3.11 2.47 December 31, 2021 Spot rates 0.25 % 0.21 % 1.58 % 12-month forward rates 1.00 1.07 1.84 Table 42 shows the pretax impact to forecasted net interest income over the next 12 months from March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 resulting from instantaneous parallel and non-parallel shocks to the market-based forward curve. Periodically, we evaluate the scenarios presented so that they are meaningful in the context of the current rate environment. The interest rate scenarios also assume U.S. dollar rates are floored at zero. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the overall decrease in asset sensitivity of our balance sheet to Up-rate and Down-rate scenarios was primarily due to an increase in long-end rates. We continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel upward move in interest rates with the majority of that impact coming from the short end of the yield curve. Additionally, higher interest rates negatively impact the fair value of our debt securities classified as available for sale and adversely affect accumulated other comprehensive income and thus capital levels under the Basel 3 capital rules. Under instantaneous upward parallel shifts, the near-term adverse impact to Basel 3 capital would be reduced over time by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income generated from the banking book activities. For more information on Basel 3, see Capital Management Regulatory Capital on page 18. Table 42 Estimated Banking Book Net Interest Income Sensitivity to Curve Changes Short Rate (bps) Long Rate (bps) (Dollars in millions) March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Parallel Shifts +100 bps instantaneous shift +100 +100 $ 5,383 $ 6,542 -25 bps instantaneous shift -25 -25 (1,424) (2,092) Flatteners Short-end instantaneous change +100 4,856 4,982 Long-end instantaneous change -25 (162) (735) Steepeners Short-end instantaneous change -25 (1,259) (1,344) Long-end instantaneous change +100 554 1,646 The sensitivity analysis in Table 42 assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates. As part of our ALM activities, we use securities, certain residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity. The behavior of our deposits portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income. The sensitivity analysis in Table 42 assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce our benefit in those scenarios. Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative Contracts We use interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts in our ALM activities to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Specifically, we use those derivatives to manage both the variability in cash flows and changes in fair value of various assets and liabilities arising from those risks. Our interest rate derivative contracts are generally non-leveraged swaps tied to various benchmark interest rates and foreign exchange basis swaps, options, futures and forwards, and our foreign exchange contracts include cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign currency futures contracts, foreign currency forward contracts and options. The derivatives used in our ALM activities can be split into two broad categories: designated accounting hedges and other risk management derivatives. Designated accounting hedges are primarily used to manage our exposure to interest rates as described in the Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book section and are included in the sensitivities presented in Table 42. The Corporation also uses foreign currency derivatives in accounting hedges to manage substantially all of the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations. By hedging the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations, the Corporation's market risk exposure in this area is insignificant. Risk management derivatives are predominantly used to hedge foreign exchange risks related to various foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities and eliminate substantially all foreign currency exposures in the cash flows of the Corporation non-trading foreign currency-denominated financial instruments. These foreign exchange derivatives are sensitive to other market risk exposures such as cross-currency basis spreads and interest rate risk. However, as these features are not a significant component of these foreign exchange derivatives, the market risk related to this exposure is insignificant. For more information on the accounting for derivatives, see Note 3 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Mortgage Banking Risk Management We originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. We determine whether loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate. Changes in interest rates impact the value of interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and the related residential first 41 Bank of America mortgage loans held-for-sale (LHFS), as well as the value of the MSRs. Because the interest rate risks of these hedged items offset, we combine them into one overall hedged item with one combined economic hedge portfolio consisting of derivative contracts and securities. For more information on IRLCs and the related residential mortgage LHFS, see Mortgage Banking Risk Management in the MD&A of the Corporation 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. During the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded gains of $14 million and $13 million related to the change in fair value of MSRs, IRLCs and LHFS, net of gains and losses on the hedge portfolio. For more information on MSRs, see Note 14 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Climate Risk Management Climate-related risks are divided into two major categories: (1) risks related to the transition to a low-carbon economy, which may entail extensive policy, legal, technology and market changes, and (2) risks related to the physical impacts of climate change, driven by extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and floods, as well as chronic longer-term shifts, such as rising average global temperatures and sea levels. These changes and events can have broad impacts on operations, supply chains, distribution networks, customers and markets and are otherwise referred to, respectively, as transition risk and physical risk. These risks can impact both financial and nonfinancial risk types. The impacts of transition risk can lead to and amplify credit risk or market risk by reducing our customers operating income or the value of their assets as well as expose us to reputational and/or litigation risk due to increased regulatory scrutiny or negative public sentiment. Physical risk can lead to increased credit risk by diminishing borrowers repayment capacity or impacting the value of collateral. In addition, it could pose increased operational risk to our facilities and people. In 2021, we publicly announced our goal to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions in our financing activities, operations and supply chain before 2050 (Net Zero Goal). We also committed to set emission reduction targets for 2030. In connection with this commitment, on April 13, 2022, we published our first targets to reduce emissions by 2030 associated with our financing activities in the auto manufacturing, energy and power generation sectors (2030 Targets). These reduction targets are intended to align with the goal to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. We plan to disclose our 2019 financed emissions baseline for our auto manufacturing, energy and power generation sectors along with 2020 data in our 2022 Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Report that we expect to publish in the Fall of 2022. We also plan to disclose the financed emissions for our entire business loan portfolio in 2023. Achieving our Net Zero Goal and 2030 Targets will require technological advances, clearly defined roadmaps for industry sectors, public policies, including those that improve the cost of capital for net zero transition and better emissions data reporting, as well as ongoing, strong and active engagement with clients, suppliers, investors, government officials and other stakeholders. Given the extended period of these and other climate-related goals we have established, our initiatives have not resulted in a significant effect on our results of operations or financial condition in the relevant periods presented herein, and are not expected to have a significant effect on our results of operations or financial condition in the near-term.

Complex Accounting Estimates Our significant accounting principles, are essential in understanding the MD&A. Many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments.
