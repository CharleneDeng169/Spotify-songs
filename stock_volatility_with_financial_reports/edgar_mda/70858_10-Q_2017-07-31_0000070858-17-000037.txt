Bank of America 2 Executive Summary Business Overview The Corporation is a Delaware corporation, a bank holding company (BHC) and a financial holding company. When used in this report, the Corporation may refer to Bank of America Corporation individually, Bank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries, or certain of Bank of America Corporation subsidiaries or affiliates. Our principal executive offices are located in Charlotte, North Carolina. Through our banking and various nonbank subsidiaries throughout the U.S. and in international markets, we provide a diversified range of banking and nonbank financial services and products through four business segments: Consumer Banking , Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM) , Global Banking and Global Markets , with the remaining operations recorded in All Other . We operate our banking activities primarily under the Bank of America, National Association (Bank of America, N.A. or BANA) charter. At June 30, 2017 , the Corporation had approximately $2.3 trillion in assets and a headcount of approximately 211,000 employees. Headcount remained relatively unchanged since December 31, 2016. Beginning in the second quarter of 2017, we changed from reporting full-time equivalent employees to reporting headcount. Prior-period amounts have been reclassified. As of June 30, 2017 , we operated in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and more than 35 countries. Our retail banking footprint covers approximately 83 percent of the U.S. population, and we serve approximately 47 million consumer and small business relationships with approximately 4,500 retail financial centers, approximately 16,000 ATMs, and leading digital banking platforms (www.bankofamerica.com) with approximately 34 million active users, including 23 million mobile active users.

We are a global leader in corporate and investment banking and trading across a broad range of asset classes serving corporations, governments, institutions and individuals around the world. Second Quarter 2017 Economic and Business Environment Macroeconomic trends in the U.S. in the second quarter were characterized by continued economic growth and low inflation, after GDP growth decelerated in the first quarter. Consumer and business attitudes on the economy have remained broadly unchanged from the high historical levels reached in the first quarter. The labor market remained healthy, with sustained strong non-farm payroll gains in the second quarter. Contrary to the Federal Open Market Committee projections, inflation fell during the quarter as year-over-year growth in headline CPI decreased by approximately half a percentage point. In June, the Federal Reserve raised its target federal funds rate corridor, in line with market expectations. Financial markets also responded to several ongoing developments: first, in response to the June rate hike and the potential for additional hikes over 2017, the Treasury yield curve continued to flatten. Second, the equity markets continued to rally, albeit with weaker momentum, with the S&P 500 index gaining over 2.5 percent. The U.S. Dollar weakened, erasing all the gains that followed the November presidential election. Abroad, after eurozone GDP grew in the first quarter at the fastest pace in two years, the recovery continued to gain momentum; although, political uncertainty remained elevated ahead of the French elections. The more robust economic momentum has failed to translate into stronger inflationary pressures, which remained depressed over the quarter. As a result, the European Central Bank remained cautious about the outlook for monetary policy and its quantitative easing program despite the improved growth outlook. The U.K. gained center-stage on both the economic and political front. The impact of Brexit has started to materialize in the economy with the first quarter GDP growth coming close to stagnation and many indicators weakening further over the second quarter, albeit still pointing to positive growth. At the same time, inflation continued in an upward trend and reached the highest level since 2012, well above the Bank of England target, driven by the pass-through from the Sterling depreciation that followed the Brexit referendum. In Japan, economic momentum remained intact in the second quarter, though business investment had slowed early in the year. The monetary policy stance remained unchanged while underlying inflation strengthened slightly over the quarter. In China, the service sector remained a key driver of economic growth. The Yuan had a volatile quarter reaching a seven-month high in June which contributed to a softening of supply chain inflationary pressures over the quarter. Recent Events Capital Management On June 28, 2017, following the Federal Reserve's non-objection to our 2017 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) capital plan, the Board of Directors (the Board) authorized the repurchase of $12.9 billion in common stock from July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018, including approximately $900 million to offset the effect of equity-based compensation plans during the same period. The common stock repurchase authorization includes both common stock and warrants. Also in connection with the non-objection to our CCAR plan, on July 26, 2017, the Board declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.12 per share, payable on September 29, 2017 to shareholders of record as of September 1, 2017. For additional information, see the Corporation's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on June 28, 2017. During the second quarter of 2017 , we repurchased approximately $2.2 billion of common stock pursuant to the Board's repurchase authorizations announced on June 29, 2016 and January 13, 2017. These repurchase authorizations expired on June 30, 2017. For additional information, see Capital Management on page 28 . Sale of Non-U.S. Consumer Credit Card Business On June 1, 2017, the Corporation completed the previously-announced sale of its non-U.S. consumer credit card business to a third party and recorded an after-tax gain of $103 million. As previously disclosed, the sale improved our transitional Basel 3 Common equity tier 1 capital ratio by 11 basis points (bps) under the Advanced approaches and 15 bps under the Standardized approach. This sale completes the transformation of our consumer credit card business from a multi-country, multi-brand business to a single-brand business serving core retail customers in the United States. For more information, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements . 3 Bank of America Series T Preferred Stock In connection with an investment in the Corporation Series T preferred stock in 2011, the holder of the Series T 6% Non-cumulative Preferred Stock (Series T preferred stock) received warrants to purchase up to 700 million shares of the Corporation common stock at an exercise price of $7.142857 per share. The holder of the Series T preferred stock publicly announced on June 30, 2017, consistent with similar statements made in its 2016 Annual Report to Shareholders, that it intends to exercise the warrants and acquire all 700 million shares of our common stock using the Series T preferred stock to satisfy the exercise price given its expectation of an increase in our common stock dividend. Upon exercise of the warrants, common shares outstanding will increase; however, there will be no effect on diluted earnings per share as this conversion has been previously included in the Corporation's diluted earnings per share calculation. Selected Financial Data Table 1 provides selected consolidated financial data for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 , and at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 . Table 1 Selected Financial Data Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 (Dollars in millions, except per share information) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Income statement Revenue, net of interest expense $ 22,829 $ 21,286 $ 45,077 $ 42,076 Net income 5,269 4,783 10,125 8,255 Diluted earnings per common share 0.46 0.41 0.87 0.68 Dividends paid per common share 0.075 0.05 0.15 0.10 Performance ratios Return on average assets 0.93 % 0.88 % 0.91 % 0.76 % Return on average common shareholders' equity 8.00 7.40 7.64 6.26 Return on average tangible common shareholders equity (1) 11.23 10.54 10.76 8.95 Efficiency ratio 60.13 63.38 63.39 67.28 June 30 2017 December 31 2016 Balance sheet Total loans and leases $ 916,666 $ 906,683 Total assets 2,254,529 2,187,702 Total deposits 1,262,980 1,260,934 Total common shareholders equity 245,767 241,620 Total shareholders equity 270,987 266,840 (1) Return on average tangible common shareholders' equity is a non-GAAP financial measure. For additional information and a corresponding reconciliation to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) financial measures, see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 67 . Financial Highlights Net income was $5.3 billion and $10.1 billion , or $0.46 and $0.87 per diluted share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to $4.8 billion and $8.3 billion , or $0.41 and $0.68 per diluted share for the same periods in 2016 . The results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same periods in 2016 were driven by higher revenue and lower provision for credit losses and an increase in noninterest expense. Total assets increased $ 66.8 billion from December 31, 2016 to $2.3 trillion at June 30, 2017 due to higher trading account assets primarily driven by increased client financing activities in equities, growth in securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell primarily due to increased matched-book activity, as well as higher cash and cash equivalents and loans and leases. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business. Total liabilities increased $62.7 billion from December 31, 2016 to $2.0 trillion at June 30, 2017 primarily driven by higher securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase due to increased matched-book activity, an increase in trading account liabilities as well as an increase in short-term borrowings. Shareholders' equity increased $4.1 billion from December 31, 2016 primarily due to net income, partially offset by returns of capital to shareholders of $7.3 billion through common stock repurchases and common and preferred stock dividends.

The net interest yield increased 11 bps to 2.29 percent, and nine bps to 2.32 percent. These increases were primarily driven by a higher interest rate environment and loan growth.

Noninterest Income Table 3 Noninterest Income Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 (Dollars in millions) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Card income $ 1,469 $ 1,464 $ 2,918 $ 2,894 Service charges 1,977 1,871 3,895 3,708 Investment and brokerage services 3,317 3,201 6,579 6,383 Investment banking income 1,532 1,408 3,116 2,561 Trading account profits 1,956 2,018 4,287 3,680 Mortgage banking income 230 312 352 745 Gains on sales of debt securities 101 249 153 439 Other income 1,261 645 1,733 1,063 Total noninterest income $ 11,843 $ 11,168 $ 23,033 $ 21,473 Noninterest income increased $675 million to $11.8 billion , and $1.6 billion to $23.0 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same periods in 2016 . The following highlights the more significant changes. Service charges increased $106 million and $187 million primarily driven by the impact of pricing strategies and higher treasury services-related revenue. Investment and brokerage services income increased $116 million and $196 million primarily driven by higher assets under management (AUM) flows and market valuations, partially offset by lower transactional revenue. Investment banking income increased $124 million and $555 million primarily due to higher advisory fees, and for the six month period, higher debt and equity issuance fees. Trading account profits decreased $62 million for the three-month period primarily due to weaker performance across fixed-income products, and increased $607 million for the six-month period primarily due to stronger performance across credit products led by mortgages, and increased client financing activity in equities. Mortgage banking income decreased $82 million and $393 million primarily due to lower production income driven by lower volumes and net servicing income due to a smaller servicing portfolio. Gains on sales of debt securities decreased $148 million and $286 million primarily driven by lower sales volume. Other income increased $616 million and $670 million primarily due to the $793 million pre-tax gain recognized in connection with the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business. Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses decreased $250 million to $726 million , and $412 million to $1.6 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same periods in 2016 primarily due to credit quality improvements in the consumer real estate portfolio and reductions in energy exposures in the commercial portfolio, partially offset by portfolio seasoning and loan growth in the U.S. credit card portfolio. For more information on the provision for credit losses, see Provision for Credit Losses on page 57 . 5 Bank of America Noninterest Expense Table 4 Noninterest Expense Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 (Dollars in millions) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Personnel $ 7,712 $ 7,722 $ 16,870 $ 16,574 Occupancy 1,001 1,036 2,001 2,064 Equipment 427 451 865 914 Marketing 442 414 774 833 Professional fees 485 472 941 897 Amortization of intangibles 160 186 322 373 Data processing 773 717 1,567 1,555 Telecommunications 177 189 368 362 Other general operating 2,549 2,306 4,866 4,737 Total noninterest expense $ 13,726 $ 13,493 $ 28,574 $ 28,309 Noninterest expense increased $233 million to $13.7 billion , and $265 million to $28.6 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same periods in 2016 . The increases were primarily due to higher other general operating expense which included a $295 million impairment charge related to certain data centers in the process of being sold and higher FDIC expense, partially offset by lower litigation expense. The increase in the six-months period was also driven by an increase in personnel expense due in part to higher revenue-related incentive costs. Income Tax Expense Table 5 Income Tax Expense Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 (Dollars in millions) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Income before income taxes $ 8,377 $ 6,817 $ 14,942 $ 11,794 Income tax expense 3,108 2,034 4,817 3,539 Effective tax rate 37.1 % 29.8 % 32.2 % 30.0 % The effective tax rates for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 were driven by the impact of our recurring tax preference benefits, offset by $690 million of tax expense recognized in connection with the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business, which related to gains on derivatives used to hedge the currency risk of the net investment. The six-month effective tax rate also included a tax benefit related to a new accounting standard on share-based compensation. The effective tax rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 were driven by our recurring tax preference items.

Bank of America 10 Supplemental Financial Data In this Form 10-Q, we present certain non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items or otherwise include components that differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional useful information to assess our financial condition, results of operations (including period-to-period operating performance) or compliance with prospective regulatory requirements. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same way as non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. We view net interest income and related ratios and analyses on an fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis, which when presented on a consolidated basis, are non-GAAP financial measures. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent and a representative state tax rate. In addition, certain performance measures including the efficiency ratio and net interest yield utilize net interest income (and thus total revenue) on an FTE basis. The efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue, and net interest yield measures the bps we earn over the cost of funds. We believe that presentation of these items on an FTE basis allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practices. We may present certain key performance indicators and ratios excluding certain items (e.g., debit valuation adjustment (DVA)) which result in non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the presentation of measures that exclude these items are useful because they provide additional information to assess the underlying operational performance and trends of our businesses and to allow better comparison of period-to-period operating performance. We also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents an adjusted shareholders equity or common shareholders equity amount which has been reduced by goodwill and certain acquired intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)), net of related deferred tax liabilities. These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models use both return on average tangible common shareholders equity and return on average tangible shareholders equity as key measures to support our overall growth goals. These ratios are as follows: Return on average tangible common shareholders equity measures our earnings contribution as a percentage of adjusted common shareholders equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders equity divided by total assets less goodwill and certain acquired intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on average tangible shareholders equity measures our earnings contribution as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders equity divided by total assets less goodwill and certain acquired intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders equity divided by ending common shares outstanding. We believe that the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. Tangible book value per share provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation to outstanding shares of common stock. The aforementioned supplemental data and performance measures are presented in Tables 6 and 7 . Table 8 presents certain non-GAAP financial measures and performance measurements on an FTE basis.

Production income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 decreased $115 million to $67 million , and $199 million to $121 million compared to the same periods in 2016 due to a decision to retain a higher percentage of residential mortgage production in Consumer Banking , as well as the impact of a higher interest rate environment driving lower refinances.

These increases were due to the same factors as described in the three-month discussion. 19 Bank of America Key Indicators and Metrics Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 (Dollars in millions, except as noted) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Revenue by Business Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management $ 3,874 $ 3,602 $ 7,656 $ 7,269 U.S. Trust 819 762 1,628 1,539 Other (1) 2 61 3 86 Total revenue, net of interest expense (FTE basis) $ 4,695 $ 4,425 $ 9,287 $ 8,894 Client Balances by Business, at period end Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management $ 2,196,238 $ 2,026,392 U.S. Trust 421,180 393,089 Total client balances $ 2,617,418 $ 2,419,481 Client Balances by Type, at period end Assets under management $ 990,709 $ 832,394 Brokerage assets 1,104,775 1,070,014 Assets in custody 128,538 120,505 Deposits 237,131 250,976 Loans and leases (2) 156,265 145,592 Total client balances $ 2,617,418 $ 2,419,481 Assets Under Management Rollforward Assets under management, beginning of period $ 946,778 $ 890,663 $ 886,148 $ 900,863 Net client flows (3) 27,516 5,885 56,730 1,466 Market valuation/other (1) 16,415 (64,154 ) 47,831 (69,935 ) Total assets under management, end of period $ 990,709 $ 832,394 $ 990,709 $ 832,394 Associates, at period end (4, 5) Number of financial advisors 17,017 16,824 Total wealth advisors, including financial advisors 18,881 18,668 Total primary sales professionals, including financial advisors and wealth advisors 19,863 19,506 Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management Metric (5) Financial advisor productivity (6) (in thousands) $ 1,040 $ 978 $ 1,016 $ 978 U.S. Trust Metric, at period end (5) Primary sales professionals 1,665 1,648 (1) Includes the results of BofA Global Capital Management, the cash management division of Bank of America, and certain administrative items.

(3) For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, net AUM flows includes $4.2 billion and $8.0 billion of net outflows related to BofA Global Capital Management's AUM that were sold during the three months ended June 30, 2016. (4) Includes financial advisors in the Consumer Banking segment of 2,206 and 2,244 at June 30, 2017 and 2016 . (5) Associate computation is based on headcount. (6) Financial advisor productivity is defined as annualized MLGWM total revenue, excluding the allocation of certain asset and liability management (ALM) activities, divided by the total average number of financial advisors (excluding financial advisors in the Consumer Banking segment). Client Balances Client balances managed under advisory and/or discretion of GWIM are AUM and are typically held in diversified portfolios. Fees earned on AUM are calculated as a percentage of clients' AUM balances. The asset management fees charged to clients per year depend on various factors, but are commonly driven by the breadth of the client relationship and generally range from 50 to 150 bps on their total AUM. The net client AUM flows represent the net change in clients AUM balances over a specified period of time, excluding market appreciation/depreciation and other adjustments. Client balances increased $197.9 billion , or eight percent , to $2.6 trillion at June 30, 2017 compared to June 30, 2016 . The increase in client balances was primarily due to AUM growth which increased $158.3 billion , or 19 percent, due to higher market valuations and positive net flows. Net Migration Summary GWIM results are impacted by the net migration of clients and their corresponding deposit, loan and brokerage balances primarily to or from Consumer Banking, as presented in the table below. Migrations result from the movement of clients between business segments to better align with client needs.

Three Months Ended June 30, 2017 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 Net income for Global Banking increased $288 million to $1.8 billion driven by higher revenue and lower provision for credit losses. Revenue increased $343 million to $5.0 billion driven by higher net interest income and noninterest income. Net interest income increased $286 million to $2.7 billion primarily driven by a stable deposit base and the impact of higher short-term rates, as well as loans and leasing-related growth, partially offset by modest margin compression. Noninterest income increased $57 million to $2.3 billion largely due to higher investment banking fees, partially offset by results from loans and related hedging activity in the fair value option portfolio. The provision for credit losses decreased $184 million to $15 million driven by improvement across most of the portfolio, particularly energy. Noninterest expense increased $29 million to $2.2 billion driven by additional investments in technology and higher FDIC expense, partially offset by lower operating costs. The return on average allocated capital was 18 percent , up from 16 percent , as higher net income was partially offset by an increased capital allocation. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 14 . 21 Bank of America Six Months Ended June 30, 2017 compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 Net income for Global Banking increased $925 million to $3.5 billion driven by higher revenue and lower provision for credit losses. Revenue increased $844 million to $10.0 billion driven by higher net interest income and noninterest income.

Noninterest income increased $327 million to $4.5 billion largely due to higher investment banking fees and treasury fees, partially offset by lower revenues related to leasing activity. The provision for credit losses decreased $720 million to $32 million primarily driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion. Noninterest expense increased $18 million to $4.3 billion primarily driven by higher revenue-related incentives and FDIC expense, partially offset by lower personnel and operating expense. The return on average allocated capital was 18 percent , up from 14 percent , as higher net income was partially offset by an increased capital allocation.

The increase in the six months ended period was driven by the impact of growth in loans and leases, partially offset by credit spread compression. Global Transaction Services revenue increased $236 million and $332 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same periods in 2016 driven by an increased deposit base driven by higher short-term rates, as well as higher treasury-related revenue. Average loans and leases increased three percent and four percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same periods in 2016 driven by growth in the commercial and industrial, and leasing portfolios.

The economics of certain investment banking and underwriting activities are shared primarily between Global Markets and Global Banking under an internal revenue-sharing arrangement . Global Banking originates certain deal-related transactions with our corporate and commercial clients that are executed and distributed by Global Markets . For more information on investment banking fees on a consolidated basis, see page 23 . Three Months Ended June 30, 2017 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 Net income for Global Markets decreased $283 million to $830 million driven by lower sales and trading revenue, investment banking fees and increased noninterest expense. Net DVA losses were $159 million compared to losses of $164 million . Sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, decreased $332 million primarily due to weaker performance in fixed-income, currencies and commodities (FICC) macro products and emerging markets. Noninterest expense increased $66 million to $2.6 billion as additional investments in technology were partially offset by lower operating costs. Average earning assets increased $33.8 billion to $456.6 billion primarily driven by targeted growth in client financing activities in the global equities business. The return on average allocated capital was 10 percent , down from 12 percent as lower net income was partially offset by a decreased capital allocation. Bank of America 24 Six Months Ended June 30, 2017 compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 Net income for Global Markets increased $42 million to $2.1 billion . Net DVA losses were $289 million compared to losses of $10 million . Excluding net DVA, net income increased $215 million to $2.3 billion primarily driven by higher sales and trading revenue and investment banking fees, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, increased $409 million primarily due to a stronger performance across credit and mortgage products. Noninterest expense increased $374 million to $5.4 billion primarily due to litigation expense in the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to a litigation recovery in the same period in 2016 and higher revenue-related expenses. Average earning assets increased $22.8 billion to $443.3 billion and period-end trading-related assets increased $55.6 billion to $436.2 billion both primarily driven by targeted growth in client financing activities in the global equities business. The return on average allocated capital was 12 percent , up from 11 percent , reflecting higher net income and a decreased capital allocation. Sales and Trading Revenue Sales and trading revenue includes unrealized and realized gains and losses on trading and other assets, net interest income, and fees primarily from commissions on equity securities. Sales and trading revenue is segregated into fixed-income (government debt obligations, investment and non-investment grade corporate debt obligations, commercial MBS, residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), interest rate and credit derivative contracts), currencies (interest rate and foreign exchange contracts), commodities (primarily futures, forwards, swaps and options) and equities (equity-linked derivatives and cash equity activity). The following table and related discussion present sales and trading revenue, substantially all of which is in Global Markets, with the remainder in Global Banking . In addition, the following table and related discussion present sales and trading revenue excluding the impact of net DVA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe the use of this non-GAAP financial measure provides additional useful information to assess the underlying performance of these businesses and to allow better comparison of period-to-period operating performance. Sales and Trading Revenue (1, 2) Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 (Dollars in millions) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Sales and trading revenue Fixed-income, currencies and commodities $ 2,106 $ 2,456 $ 4,916 $ 4,861 Equities 1,104 1,081 2,193 2,118 Total sales and trading revenue $ 3,210 $ 3,537 $ 7,109 $ 6,979 Sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA (3) Fixed-income, currencies and commodities $ 2,254 $ 2,615 $ 5,184 $ 4,880 Equities 1,115 1,086 2,214 2,109 Total sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA $ 3,369 $ 3,701 $ 7,398 $ 6,989 (1) Includes FTE adjustments of $52 million and $99 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to $44 million and $87 million for the same periods in 2016 . For more information on sales and trading revenue, see Note 2 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . (2) Includes Global Banking sales and trading revenue of $56 million and $114 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to $120 million and $280 million for the same periods in 2016 . (3) FICC and Equities sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, is a non-GAAP financial measure. FICC net DVA losses were $148 million and $268 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to net DVA losses of $159 million and $19 million for the same periods in 2016 . Equities net DVA losses were $11 million and $21 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to net DVA losses of $5 million and gains of $9 million for the same periods in 2016 . The explanations for period-over-period changes in sales and trading, FICC and Equities revenue, as set forth below, would be the same if net DVA was included. Three Months Ended June 30, 2017 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 FICC revenue, excluding net DVA, decreased $361 million due to weaker performance in rates and emerging markets relative to an especially strong quarter in the prior year. Equities revenue, excluding net DVA, increased $29 million primarily due to growth in client financing activities offset by slower secondary markets. Six Months Ended June 30, 2017 compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 FICC revenue, excluding net DVA, increased $304 million due to strength in credit and mortgage products. Equities revenue, excluding net DVA, increased $105 million primarily due to growth in client financing activities. 25 Bank of America All Other Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 (Dollars in millions) 2017 2016 % Change 2017 2016 % Change Net interest income (FTE basis) $ 91 $ 218 (58 )% $ 181 $ 349 (48 )% Noninterest income: Card income 28 54 (48 ) 70 99 (29 ) Mortgage banking income 89 44 102 91 286 (68 ) Gains on sales of debt securities 101 249 (59 ) 153 439 (65 ) All other income (loss) 569 (281 ) n/m 289 (614 ) (147 ) Total noninterest income 787 66 n/m 603 210 n/m Total revenue, net of interest expense (FTE basis) 878 284 n/m 784 559 40 Provision for credit losses (159 ) 42 n/m (185 ) (79 ) 134 Noninterest expense 1,122 1,082 4 3,311 3,464 (4 ) Loss before income taxes (FTE basis) (85 ) (840 ) (90 ) (2,342 ) (2,826 ) (17 ) Income tax expense (benefit) (FTE basis) 98 (633 ) (115 ) (1,325 ) (1,523 ) (13 ) Net loss $ (183 ) $ (207 ) (12 ) $ (1,017 ) $ (1,303 ) (22 ) Balance Sheet (1) Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 Average 2017 2016 % Change 2017 2016 % Change Total loans and leases $ 87,667 $ 111,553 (21 )% $ 91,250 $ 114,803 (21 )% Total deposits 26,320 28,461 (8 ) 25,811 27,610 (7 ) Period end June 30 2017 December 31 2016 % Change Total loans and leases (2) $ 78,830 $ 96,713 (18 )% Total deposits 26,603 23,061 15 (1) In segments where the total of liabilities and equity exceeds assets, which are generally deposit-taking segments, we allocate assets from All Other to those segments to match liabilities (i.e., deposits) and allocated shareholders equity. Such allocated assets were $521.8 billion and $521.9 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to $499.5 billion and $496.5 billion for the same periods in 2016 , and $517.7 billion and $518.7 billion at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 . (2) Included $9.2 billion of non-U.S. credit card loans, which were included in assets of business held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2016 . On June 1, 2017, the Corporation completed the sale of its non-U.S. consumer credit card business. n/m = not meaningful All Other consists of ALM activities , equity investments, non-core mortgage loans and servicing activities, the net impact of periodic revisions to the MSR valuation model for both core and non-core MSRs and the related economic hedge results and ineffectiveness, other liquidating businesses, residual expense allocations and other. ALM activities encompass certain residential mortgages, debt securities, interest rate and foreign currency risk management activities, the impact of certain allocation methodologies and accounting hedge ineffectiveness . The results of certain ALM activities are allocated to our business segments. For more information on our ALM activities, see Note 17 Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Equity investments include our merchant services joint venture as well as Global Principal Investments (GPI) which is comprised of a portfolio of equity, real estate and other alternative investments. For more information on our merchant services joint venture, see Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements . On June 1, 2017, we completed the sale of our non-U.S. consumer credit card business, resulting in a $103 million after-tax gain associated with the sale. For more information on the sale of our non-U.S. consumer credit card business, see Recent Events on page 3 and Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements . The Corporation classifies consumer real estate loans as core or non-core based on loan and customer characteristics such as origination date, product type, LTV, FICO score and delinquency status. For more information on the core and non-core portfolios, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 39 . Residential mortgage loans that are held for ALM purposes, including interest rate or liquidity risk management, are classified as core and are presented on the balance sheet of All Other . For more information on our interest rate and liquidity risk management activities, see Liquidity Risk on page 35 and Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 63 . During the six months ended June 30, 2017 , residential mortgage loans held for ALM activities decreased $3.3 billion to $31.4 billion at June 30, 2017 primarily as a result of payoffs and paydowns outpacing new originations. Non-core residential mortgage and home equity loans, which are principally run-off portfolios, including certain loans accounted for under the fair value option and MSRs pertaining to non-core loans serviced for others, are also held in All Other . During the six months ended June 30, 2017 , total non-core loans decreased $5.9 billion to $47.2 billion at June 30, 2017 due primarily to payoffs and paydowns, as well as loan sales. Three Months Ended June 30, 2017 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 The net loss for All Other decreased $24 million to $183 million due to a $793 million pre-tax gain recognized in connection with the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business, a benefit in the provision for credit losses and higher mortgage banking income, offset by higher income tax expense, lower gains on sales of debt securities, lower net interest income and higher noninterest expense. The provision for credit losses improved $201 million to a benefit of $159 million driven by reserve releases associated with the continued improvement in non-core consumer real estate loans as well as continued run-off of the portfolio. Noninterest expense increased $40 million to $1.1 billion driven by a $295 million Bank of America 26 impairment charge related to certain data centers in the process of being sold and an increase in severance costs, offset by lower operating and non-core mortgage costs. Income tax expense was $98 million compared to a benefit of $633 million driven by tax expense of $690 million recognized in connection with the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business, which related to gains on derivatives used to hedge the currency risk of the net investment. Both periods included income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking . Six Months Ended June 30, 2017 compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 The net loss for All Other decreased $286 million to $1.0 billion due to a $793 million pre-tax gain related to the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business, a decrease in noninterest expense and a benefit in the provision for credit losses, offset by lower gains on sales of debt securities, a decrease in the income tax benefit, lower net interest income and lower mortgage banking income. Mortgage banking income in All Other decreased $195 million primarily driven by lower MSR results, net of the related hedge performance, and lower servicing fees driven by a smaller servicing portfolio. Gains on sales of loans, including nonperforming and other delinquent loans, and re-performing loans were $44 million compared to gains of $178 million in the same period in 2016 . The benefit in the provision for credit losses increased $106 million to a benefit of $185 million driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion. Noninterest expense decreased $153 million to $3.3 billion driven by lower litigation expense and a decline in non-core mortgage servicing costs, partially offset by the factors as described in the three-month discussion. The income tax benefit was $1.3 billion compared to a benefit of $1.5 billion . The decrease was driven by a $690 million tax expense as described in the three-month discussion, partially offset by a tax benefit related to a new accounting standard on share-based compensation. Both periods included income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking . Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have contractual obligations to make future payments on debt and lease agreements. Additionally, in the normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements whereby we commit to future purchases of products or services from unaffiliated parties. For more information on obligations and commitments, see Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements , Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations in the MD&A of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K , as well as Note 11 Long-term Debt and Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Representations and Warranties For more information on representations and warranties, the liability for representations and warranties exposures and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss, see Note 7 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K and, for more information related to the sensitivity of the assumptions used to estimate our liability for representations and warranties, see Complex Accounting Estimates Representations and Warranties Liability in the MD&A of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K . At June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , we had $17.6 billion and $18.3 billion of unresolved repurchase claims, predominately related to subprime and pay option first-lien loans and home equity loans. Outstanding repurchase claims remain unresolved primarily due to (1) the level of detail, support and analysis accompanying such claims, which impact overall claim quality and, therefore, claim resolution and (2) the lack of an established process to resolve disputes related to these claims. In addition to unresolved repurchase claims, we have received notifications from sponsors of third-party securitizations with whom we engaged in whole-loan transactions indicating that we may have indemnity obligations with respect to loans for which we have not received a repurchase request. These outstanding notifications totaled $1.3 billion at both June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 . There were no new notifications received during the six months ended June 30, 2017 . The liability for representations and warranties and corporate guarantees is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the related provision is included in mortgage banking income. At June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , the liability for representations and warranties was $2.2 billion and $2.3 billion . For the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 , the representations and warranties provision was a benefit of $2 million and $5 million compared to a provision of $17 million and $59 million for the same periods in 2016 . In addition, we currently estimate that the range of possible loss for representations and warranties exposures could be up to $2 billion over existing accruals at June 30, 2017 . The estimated range of possible loss represents a reasonably possible loss, but does not represent a probable loss, and is based on currently available information, significant judgment and a number of assumptions that are subject to change. Future provisions and/or ranges of possible loss associated with obligations under representations and warranties may be significantly impacted if future experiences are different from historical experience or our understandings, interpretations or assumptions. Adverse developments, with respect to one or more of the assumptions underlying the liability for representations and warranties and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss, such as counterparties successfully challenging or avoiding the application of the relevant statute of limitations, could result in significant increases to future provisions and/or the estimated range of possible loss. Other Mortgage-related Matters We continue to be subject to additional mortgage-related litigation and disputes, as well as governmental and regulatory scrutiny and investigations, related to our past and current origination, servicing, transfer of servicing and servicing rights, servicing compliance obligations, foreclosure activities, indemnification obligations, and mortgage insurance and captive reinsurance practices with mortgage insurers. The ongoing environment of additional regulation, increased regulatory compliance obligations, and enhanced regulatory enforcement, combined with ongoing uncertainty related to the continuing evolution of the regulatory 27 Bank of America environment, has resulted in increased operational and compliance costs and may limit our ability to continue providing certain products and services. For more information on management estimate of the aggregate range of possible loss for certain litigation matters and on regulatory investigations, see Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Managing Risk Risk is inherent in all our business activities. The seven key types of risk faced by the Corporation are strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. Sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver for our shareholders. If not managed well, risks can result in financial loss, regulatory sanctions and penalties, and damage to our reputation, each of which may adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategies. The Corporation takes a comprehensive approach to risk management with a defined Risk Framework and an articulated Risk Appetite Statement which are approved annually by the Enterprise Risk Committee (ERC) and the Board. Our Risk Framework is the foundation for comprehensive management of the risks facing the Corporation. The Risk Framework sets forth clear roles, responsibilities and accountability for the management of risk and provides a blueprint for how the Board, through delegation of authority to committees and executive officers, establishes risk appetite and associated limits for our activities. Our Risk Appetite Statement is intended to ensure that the Corporation maintains an acceptable risk profile by providing a common framework and a comparable set of measures for senior management and the Board to clearly indicate the level of risk the Corporation is willing to accept. Risk appetite is set at least annually and is aligned with the Corporation's strategic, capital and financial operating plans. Our line of business strategies and risk appetite are also similarly aligned. For more information on our risk management activities, including our Risk Framework, and the key types of risk faced by the Corporation, see Managing Risk through Reputational Risk sections in the MD&A of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Capital Management The Corporation manages its capital position so its capital is more than adequate to support its business activities and to maintain capital, risk and risk appetite commensurate with one another. Additionally, we seek to maintain safety and soundness at all times, even under adverse scenarios, take advantage of organic growth opportunities, meet obligations to creditors and counterparties, maintain ready access to financial markets, continue to serve as a credit intermediary, remain a source of strength for our subsidiaries, and satisfy current and future regulatory capital requirements. Capital management is integrated into our risk and governance processes, as capital is a key consideration in the development of our strategic plan, risk appetite and risk limits. We periodically review capital allocated to our businesses and allocate capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. For additional information, see Business Segment Operations on page 14 . CCAR and Capital Planning The Federal Reserve requires BHCs to submit a capital plan and requests for capital actions on an annual basis, consistent with the rules governing the CCAR capital plan. On June 28, 2017, following the Federal Reserve's non-objection to our 2017 CCAR capital plan, the Board authorized the repurchase of $12.9 billion in common stock from July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018, including approximately $900 million to offset the effect of equity-based compensation plans during the same period. The common stock repurchase authorization includes both common stock and warrants. The timing and amount of common stock repurchases will be subject to various factors, including the Corporation capital position, liquidity, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock trading price, and general market conditions, and may be suspended at any time. The common stock repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including repurchase plans that satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As a well-capitalized BHC, we may notify the Federal Reserve of our intention to make additional capital distributions not to exceed 0.25 percent of Tier 1 capital, and which were not contemplated in our capital plan, subject to the Federal Reserve's non-objection. During the 12 months ended June 30, 2017 , we had repurchased $7.7 billion of common stock, pursuant to the Board's repurchase authorizations announced on June 29, 2016 and January 13, 2017. These repurchase authorizations expired on June 30, 2017 . Bank of America 28 Regulatory Capital As a financial services holding company, we are subject to regulatory capital rules issued by U.S. banking regulators including Basel 3, which includes certain transition provisions through January 1, 2019. The Corporation and its primary affiliated banking entity, BANA, are Basel 3 Advanced approaches institutions. Basel 3 Overview Basel 3 updated the composition of capital and established a Common equity tier 1 capital ratio. Common equity tier 1 capital primarily includes common stock, retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI), net of deductions and adjustments primarily related to goodwill, deferred tax assets, intangibles, MSRs and defined benefit pension assets. Under the Basel 3 regulatory capital transition provisions, certain deductions and adjustments to Common equity tier 1 capital are phased in through January 1, 2018. As of January 1, 2017, under the transition provisions, 80 percent of these deductions and adjustments was recognized. Basel 3 also revised minimum capital ratios and buffer requirements, added a supplementary leverage ratio (SLR), and addressed the adequately capitalized minimum requirements under the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. Finally, Basel 3 established two methods of calculating risk-weighted assets, the Standardized approach and the Advanced approaches. The Standardized approach relies primarily on supervisory risk weights based on exposure type, and the Advanced approaches determine risk weights based on internal models. As an Advanced approaches institution, we are required to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and risk-weighted assets under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is used to assess capital adequacy including under the PCA framework. Minimum Capital Requirements Minimum capital requirements and related buffers are being phased in from January 1, 2014 through January 1, 2019. The PCA framework establishes categories of capitalization including well capitalized, based on the Basel 3 regulatory ratio requirements. U.S. banking regulators are required to take certain mandatory actions depending on the category of capitalization, with no mandatory actions required for well-capitalized banking organizations, which included BANA at June 30, 2017 . We are subject to a capital conservation buffer, a countercyclical capital buffer and a global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge that are being phased in over a three-year period ending January 1, 2019. Once fully phased in, the Corporation risk-based capital ratio requirements will include a capital conservation buffer greater than 2.5 percent, plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer and a G-SIB surcharge in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. The buffers and surcharge must be comprised solely of Common equity tier 1 capital. Under the phase-in provisions, we were required to maintain a capital conservation buffer greater than 1.25 percent plus a G-SIB surcharge of 1.5 percent at June 30, 2017 . The countercyclical capital buffer is currently set at zero. We estimate that our fully phased-in G-SIB surcharge will be 2.5 percent. The G-SIB surcharge may differ from this estimate over time. For more information on the Corporation's transition and fully phased-in capital ratios and regulatory requirements, see Table 11 . Supplementary Leverage Ratio Basel 3 requires Advanced approaches institutions to disclose an SLR. The numerator of the SLR is quarter-end Basel 3 Tier 1 capital. The denominator is total leverage exposure based on the daily average of the sum of on-balance sheet exposures less permitted Tier 1 deductions, as well as the simple average of certain off-balance sheet exposures, as of the end of each month in a quarter. Effective January 1, 2018, the Corporation will be required to maintain a minimum SLR of 3.0 percent, plus a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Insured depository institution subsidiaries of BHCs will be required to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be considered "well capitalized" under the PCA framework. Capital Composition and Ratios Table 11 presents Bank of America Corporation transition and fully phased-in capital ratios and related information in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced approaches as measured at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 . Fully phased-in estimates are non-GAAP financial measures that the Corporation considers to be useful measures in evaluating compliance with new regulatory capital requirements that are not yet effective. For reconciliations to GAAP financial measures, see Table 14 . As of June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , the Corporation met the definition of well capitalized under current regulatory requirements. 29 Bank of America Table 11 Bank of America Corporation Regulatory Capital under Basel 3 (1) June 30, 2017 Transition Fully Phased-in (Dollars in millions) Standardized Approach Advanced Approaches Regulatory Minimum (2) Standardized Approach Advanced Approaches (3) Regulatory Minimum (4) Risk-based capital metrics: Common equity tier 1 capital $ 171,431 $ 171,431 $ 168,704 $ 168,704 Tier 1 capital 194,822 194,822 193,576 193,576 Total capital (5) 231,696 222,671 228,536 219,511 Risk-weighted assets (in billions) 1,390 1,478 1,405 1,464 Common equity tier 1 capital ratio 12.3 % 11.6 % 7.25 % 12.0 % 11.5 % 9.5 % Tier 1 capital ratio 14.0 13.2 8.75 13.8 13.2 11.0 Total capital ratio 16.7 15.1 10.75 16.3 15.0 13.0 Leverage-based metrics: Adjusted quarterly average assets (in billions) (6) $ 2,192 $ 2,192 $ 2,192 $ 2,192 Tier 1 leverage ratio 8.9 % 8.9 % 4.0 8.8 % 8.8 % 4.0 SLR leverage exposure (in billions) $ 2,755 SLR 7.0 % 5.0 December 31, 2016 Risk-based capital metrics: Common equity tier 1 capital $ 168,866 $ 168,866 $ 162,729 $ 162,729 Tier 1 capital 190,315 190,315 187,559 187,559 Total capital (5) 228,187 218,981 223,130 213,924 Risk-weighted assets (in billions) 1,399 1,530 1,417 1,512 Common equity tier 1 capital ratio 12.1 % 11.0 % 5.875 % 11.5 % 10.8 % 9.5 % Tier 1 capital ratio 13.6 12.4 7.375 13.2 12.4 11.0 Total capital ratio 16.3 14.3 9.375 15.8 14.2 13.0 Leverage-based metrics: Adjusted quarterly average assets (in billions) (6) $ 2,131 $ 2,131 $ 2,131 $ 2,131 Tier 1 leverage ratio 8.9 % 8.9 % 4.0 8.8 % 8.8 % 4.0 SLR leverage exposure (in billions) $ 2,702 SLR 6.9 % 5.0 (1) As an Advanced approaches institution, we are required to report regulatory capital risk-weighted assets and ratios under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is to be used to assess capital adequacy and was the Advanced approaches method at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 . (2) The June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 amounts include a transition capital conservation buffer of 1.25 percent and 0.625 percent, and a transition G-SIB surcharge of 1.5 percent and 0.75 percent. The countercyclical capital buffer for both periods is zero. (3) Basel 3 fully phased-in Advanced approaches estimates assume approval by U.S. banking regulators of our internal models methodology (IMM) for calculating counterparty credit risk regulatory capital for derivatives. As of June 30, 2017, we did not have regulatory approval of the IMM model. Basel 3 fully phased-in Common equity tier 1 capital ratio would be reduced by approximately 25 bps if IMM is not used. (4) Fully phased-in regulatory minimums assume a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent and estimated G-SIB surcharge of 2.5 percent . The estimated fully phased-in countercyclical capital buffer is currently set at zero . We will be subject to fully phased-in regulatory minimums on January 1, 2019. The fully phased-in SLR minimum assumes a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent and is applicable on January 1, 2018. (5) Total capital under the Advanced approaches differs from the Standardized approach due to differences in the amount permitted in Tier 2 capital related to the qualifying allowance for credit losses. (6) Reflects adjusted average total assets for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 . Common equity tier 1 capital under Basel 3 Advanced Transition was $171.4 billion at June 30, 2017 , an increase of $2.6 billion compared to December 31, 2016 driven by earnings, partially offset by common stock repurchases, dividends and the phase-in under Basel 3 transition provisions of deductions, primarily related to deferred tax assets. During the six months ended June 30, 2017 , Total capital increased $3.7 billion primarily driven by the same factors as the increase in Common equity tier 1 capital. Risk-weighted assets decreased $52 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2017 to $1,478 billion primarily due to model improvements, the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business, improved credit quality and lower market risk.

Bank of America 32 Regulatory Developments Minimum Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity The Federal Reserve has established a final rule effective January 1, 2019, which includes minimum external total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) requirements to improve the resolvability and resiliency of large, interconnected BHCs. We estimate our minimum required external TLAC would be the greater of 22.5 percent of risk-weighted assets or 9.5 percent of SLR leverage exposure. In addition, U.S. G-SIBs must meet a minimum long-term debt requirement. Our minimum required long-term debt is estimated to be the greater of 8.5 percent of risk-weighted assets or 4.5 percent of SLR leverage exposure. The impact of the TLAC rule is not expected to be material to our results of operations. Revisions to Approaches for Measuring Risk-weighted Assets The Basel Committee has several open proposals to revise key methodologies for measuring risk-weighted assets. The proposals include a standardized approach for credit risk, standardized approach for operational risk, revisions to the credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk framework and constraints on the use of internal models. The Basel Committee has also finalized a revised standardized model for counterparty credit risk, revisions to the securitization framework and its fundamental review of the trading book, which updates both modeled and standardized approaches for market risk measurement. These revisions are to be coupled with a proposed capital floor framework to limit the extent to which banks can reduce risk-weighted asset levels through the use of internal models, both at the input parameter and aggregate risk-weighted asset level. After the outstanding proposals are finalized by the Basel Committee, U.S. banking regulators may update the U.S. Basel 3 rules to incorporate the Basel Committee revisions. Revisions to the G-SIB Assessment Framework On March 30, 2017, the Basel Committee issued a consultative document with proposed revisions to the G-SIB surcharge assessment framework. The proposed revisions would include removing the cap on the substitutability category, expanding the scope of consolidation to include insurance subsidiaries in three categories (size, interconnectedness and complexity) and modifying the substitutability category weights with the introduction of a new trading volume indicator. The Basel Committee has also requested feedback on a new short-term wholesale funding indicator, which would be included in the interconnectedness category. The U.S. banking regulators may update the U.S. G-SIB surcharge rule to incorporate the Basel Committee revisions. For more information on our Regulatory Developments see Capital Management Regulatory Developments in the MD&A of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Broker-dealer Regulatory Capital and Securities Regulation The Corporation principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (MLPF&S) and Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp (MLPCC). MLPCC is a fully-guaranteed subsidiary of MLPF&S and provides clearing and settlement services. Both entities are subject to the net capital requirements of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 15c3-1. Both entities are also registered as futures commission merchants and are subject to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Regulation 1.17. MLPF&S has elected to compute the minimum capital requirement in accordance with the Alternative Net Capital Requirement as permitted by SEC Rule 15c3-1. At June 30, 2017 , MLPF&S regulatory net capital as defined by Rule 15c3-1 was $12.3 billion and exceeded the minimum requirement of $1.7 billion by $10.6 billion. MLPCC net capital of $3.5 billion exceeded the minimum requirement of $640 million by $2.9 billion. In accordance with the Alternative Net Capital Requirements, MLPF&S is required to maintain tentative net capital in excess of $1.0 billion, net capital in excess of $500 million and notify the SEC in the event its tentative net capital is less than $5.0 billion. At June 30, 2017 , MLPF&S had tentative net capital and net capital in excess of the minimum and notification requirements. Merrill Lynch International (MLI), a U.K. investment firm, is regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority, and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. At June 30, 2017 , MLI capital resources were $35.4 billion which exceeded the minimum requirement of $14.6 billion. 33 Bank of America Common and Preferred Stock Dividends Table 16 is a summary of our cash dividend declarations on preferred stock during the second quarter of 2017 and through July 31, 2017 .

Bank of America 34 Liquidity Risk Funding and Liquidity Risk Management Our primary liquidity risk management objective is to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral needs while continuing to support our businesses and customers under a range of economic conditions. To achieve that objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk under expected and stressed conditions, maintain liquidity and access to diverse funding sources, including our stable deposit base, and seek to align liquidity-related incentives and risks. We define liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we can use to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations as those obligations arise. We manage our liquidity position through line of business and ALM activities, as well as through our legal entity funding strategy, on both a forward and current (including intraday) basis under both expected and stressed conditions. We believe that a centralized approach to funding and liquidity management enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding sources, minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events. For more information regarding global funding and liquidity risk management, see Liquidity Risk Time-to-required Funding and Stress Modeling in the MD&A of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K . NB Holdings, Inc. In the third quarter of 2016, we entered into intercompany arrangements with certain key subsidiaries under which we transferred certain of our parent company assets, and agreed to transfer certain additional parent company assets not needed to satisfy anticipated near-term expenditures, to NB Holdings, Inc., a wholly-owned holding company subsidiary (NB Holdings). The parent company is expected to continue to have access to the same flow of dividends, interest and other amounts of cash necessary to service its debt, pay dividends and perform other obligations as it would have had if it had not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets. In consideration for the transfer of assets, NB Holdings issued a subordinated note to the parent company in a principal amount equal to the value of the transferred assets. The aggregate principal amount of the note will increase by the amount of any future asset transfers. NB Holdings also provided the parent company with a committed line of credit that allows the parent company to draw funds necessary to service near-term cash needs. These arrangements support our preferred single point of entry resolution strategy, under which only the parent company would be resolved under the U.S Bankruptcy Code. These arrangements include provisions to terminate the line of credit, forgive the subordinated note and require the parent company to transfer its remaining financial assets to NB Holdings if our projected liquidity resources deteriorate so severely that resolution of the parent company becomes imminent. Global Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets We maintain liquidity available to the Corporation, including the parent company and selected subsidiaries, in the form of cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Our liquidity buffer, referred to as Global Liquidity Sources (GLS), is comprised of assets that are readily available to the parent company and selected subsidiaries, including holding company, bank and broker- dealer subsidiaries, even during stressed market conditions. Our cash is primarily on deposit with the Federal Reserve and, to a lesser extent, central banks outside of the U.S. We limit the composition of high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities to U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency MBS and a select group of non-U.S. government securities. We can quickly obtain cash for these securities, even in stressed conditions, through repurchase agreements or outright sales. We hold our GLS in legal entities that allow us to meet the liquidity requirements of our global businesses, and we consider the impact of potential regulatory, tax, legal and other restrictions that could limit the transferability of funds among entities. Our GLS are substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the final U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) rules. However, HQLA for purposes of calculating LCR is not reported at market value, but at a lower value which incorporates regulatory deductions and the exclusion of excess liquidity held at certain subsidiaries. Our average consolidated HQLA, on a net basis, was $425 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2017. For more information on the final LCR rules, see Liquidity Risk Basel 3 Liquidity Standards on page 36 . Our GLS were $514 billion and $499 billion at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 and were as shown in Table 17 . Table 17 Global Liquidity Sources Average Three Months Ended June 30 2017 (Dollars in billions) June 30 2017 December 31 2016 Parent company and NB Holdings $ 86 $ 76 $ 80 Bank subsidiaries 376 372 383 Other regulated entities 52 51 50 Total Global Liquidity Sources $ 514 $ 499 $ 513 As shown in Table 17 , parent company and NB Holdings liquidity totaled $86 billion and $76 billion at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 . The increase in parent company and NB Holdings liquidity was primarily due to debt issuance outpacing maturities. Typically, parent company and NB Holdings liquidity is in the form of cash deposited with BANA. Liquidity held at our bank subsidiaries totaled $376 billion and $372 billion at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 . The increase in bank subsidiaries liquidity was primarily due to net debt issuances. Liquidity at bank subsidiaries excludes the cash deposited by the parent company and NB Holdings. Our bank subsidiaries can also generate incremental liquidity by pledging a range of unencumbered loans and securities to certain Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against this pool of specifically-identified eligible assets was $290 billion and $310 billion at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 with the decrease due to FHLB borrowings, which reduced available borrowing capacity, and adjustments to our valuation model. We have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against these assets, including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loans and securities collateral. Eligibility is defined in guidelines from the FHLBs and the Federal Reserve and is subject to change at their discretion. Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity 35 Bank of America generated by the bank subsidiaries can generally be used only to fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries and transfers to the parent company or nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to prior regulatory approval. Liquidity held at our other regulated entities, comprised primarily of broker-dealer subsidiaries, totaled $52 billion and $51 billion at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 . Our other regulated entities also held unencumbered investment-grade securities and equities that we believe could be used to generate additional liquidity. Liquidity held in an other regulated entity is primarily available to meet the obligations of that entity and transfers to the parent company or to any other subsidiary may be subject to prior regulatory approval due to regulatory restrictions and minimum requirements. Table 18 presents the composition of GLS at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 . Table 18 Global Liquidity Sources Composition (Dollars in billions) June 30 2017 December 31 2016 Cash on deposit $ 116 $ 106 U.S. Treasury securities 63 58 U.S. agency securities and mortgage-backed securities 324 318 Non-U.S. government securities 11 17 Total Global Liquidity Sources $ 514 $ 499 Time-to-required Funding and Liquidity Stress Analysis We use a variety of metrics to determine the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our subsidiaries. One metric we use to evaluate the appropriate level of liquidity at the parent company and NB Holdings is time-to-required funding (TTF). This debt coverage measure indicates the number of months the parent company can continue to meet its unsecured contractual obligations as they come due using only the parent company and NB Holdings' liquidity sources without issuing any new debt or accessing any additional liquidity sources. We define unsecured contractual obligations for purposes of this metric as maturities of senior or subordinated debt issued or guaranteed by Bank of America Corporation. These include certain unsecured debt instruments, primarily structured liabilities, which we may be required to settle for cash prior to maturity. TTF was 49 months at June 30, 2017 compared to 35 months at December 31, 2016 . The increase in TTF was driven by debt issuances outpacing maturities. We also utilize liquidity stress analysis to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our subsidiaries. The liquidity stress testing process is an integral part of analyzing our potential contractual and contingent cash outflows. We evaluate the liquidity requirements under a range of scenarios with varying levels of severity and time horizons. The scenarios we consider and utilize incorporate market-wide and Corporation-specific events, including potential credit rating downgrades for the parent company and our subsidiaries, and more severe events including potential resolution scenarios. The scenarios are based on our historical experience, experience of distressed and failed financial institutions, regulatory guidance, and both expected and unexpected future events. The types of potential contractual and contingent cash outflows we consider in our scenarios may include, but are not limited to, upcoming contractual maturities of unsecured debt and reductions in new debt issuance; diminished access to secured financing markets; potential deposit withdrawals; increased draws on loan commitments, liquidity facilities and letters of credit; additional collateral that counterparties could call if our credit ratings were downgraded; collateral and margin requirements arising from market value changes; and potential liquidity required to maintain businesses and finance customer activities. Changes in certain market factors, including, but not limited to, credit rating downgrades, could negatively impact potential contractual and contingent outflows and the related financial instruments, and in some cases these impacts could be material to our financial results. We consider all sources of funds that we could access during each stress scenario and focus particularly on matching available sources with corresponding liquidity requirements by legal entity. We also use the stress modeling results to manage our asset and liability profile and establish limits and guidelines on certain funding sources and businesses. Basel 3 Liquidity Standards Basel 3 has two liquidity risk-related standards: the LCR and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR). The LCR is calculated as the amount of a financial institution unencumbered HQLA relative to the estimated net cash outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period of significant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. As of June 30, 2017 , the consolidated Corporation and its insured depository institutions were above the 2017 LCR requirements. Our LCR may fluctuate from period to period due to normal business flows from customer activity. Beginning with the second quarter 2017 results, we are required to disclose publicly, on a quarterly basis, quantitative information about our LCR calculation and a discussion of the factors that have a significant effect on our LCR. This information will be available on our Investor Relations website on a quarterly basis beginning in August 2017. U.S. banking regulators have issued a proposal for an NSFR requirement applicable to U.S. financial institutions following the Basel Committee's final standard. The U.S. NSFR would apply to the Corporation on a consolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions beginning on January 1, 2018, if finalized as proposed. We expect to meet the NSFR requirement within the regulatory timeline. The standard is intended to reduce funding risk over a longer time horizon. The NSFR is designed to ensure an appropriate amount of stable funding, generally capital and liabilities maturing beyond one year, given the mix of assets and off-balance sheet items. Diversified Funding Sources We fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits and secured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally coordinated funding approach diversified across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups. The primary benefits of our centralized funding approach include greater control, reduced funding costs, wider name recognition by investors and greater flexibility to meet the variable funding requirements of subsidiaries. Where regulations, time zone differences or other business considerations make parent company funding impractical, certain other subsidiaries may issue their own debt. We fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposits, which were $1.26 trillion at both June 30, 2017 and Bank of America 36 December 31, 2016 . Deposits are primarily generated by our Consumer Banking , GWIM and Global Banking segments. These deposits are diversified by clients, product type and geography, and the majority of our U.S. deposits are insured by the FDIC. We consider a substantial portion of our deposits to be a stable, low-cost and consistent source of funding. We believe this deposit funding is generally less sensitive to interest rate changes, market volatility or changes in our credit ratings than wholesale funding sources. Our lending activities may also be financed through secured borrowings, including credit card securitizations and securitizations with GSEs, the FHA and private-label investors, as well as FHLB loans. Our trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded on a secured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions. We believe funding these activities in the secured financing markets is more cost-efficient and less sensitive to changes in our credit ratings than unsecured financing. Repurchase agreements are generally short-term and often overnight. Disruptions in secured financing markets for financial institutions have occurred in prior market cycles which resulted in adverse changes in terms or significant reductions in the availability of such financing. We manage the liquidity risks arising from secured funding by sourcing funding globally from a diverse group of counterparties, providing a range of securities collateral and pursuing longer durations, when appropriate. For more information on secured financing agreements, see Note 9 Federal Funds Sold or Purchased, Securities Financing Agreements and Short-term Borrowings to the Consolidated Financial Statements . We issue long-term unsecured debt in a variety of maturities and currencies to achieve cost-efficient funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity profile. While the cost and availability of unsecured funding may be negatively impacted by general market conditions or by matters specific to the financial services industry or the Corporation, we seek to mitigate refinancing risk by actively managing the amount of our borrowings that we anticipate will mature within any month or quarter. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 , we issued $16.0 billion and $33.4 billion of long-term debt consisting of $10.6 billion and $23.5 billion for Bank of America Corporation, substantially all of which was TLAC compliant, $3.0 billion and $5.1 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $2.4 billion and $4.8 billion of other debt. Table 19 presents the carrying value of aggregate annual contractual maturities of long-term debt as of June 30, 2017 . During the six months ended June 30, 2017 , we had total long-term debt maturities and purchases of $29.4 billion consisting of $12.3 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $11.8 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $5.3 billion of other debt.

We may, from time to time, purchase outstanding debt instruments in various transactions, depending on prevailing market conditions, liquidity and other factors. In addition, our other regulated entities may make markets in our debt instruments to provide liquidity for investors. For information on long-term debt funding, see Note 11 Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K and for information regarding funding and liquidity risk management, see Liquidity Risk Time-to-required Funding and Stress Modeling in the MD&A of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K . We use derivative transactions to manage the duration, interest rate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering the characteristics of the assets they are funding. For more information on our ALM activities, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 63 . We may also issue unsecured debt in the form of structured notes for client purposes, certain of which qualify as TLAC eligible debt. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 , we issued $1.3 billion and $2.3 billion of structured notes, which are debt obligations that pay investors returns linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these liabilities with derivatives and/or investments in the underlying instruments, so that from a funding perspective, the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We could be required to settle certain structured note obligations for cash or other securities prior to maturity under certain circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning purposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date. Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price. Contingency Planning We maintain contingency funding plans that outline our potential responses to liquidity stress events at various levels of severity. These policies and plans are based on stress scenarios and include potential funding strategies and communication and notification procedures that we would implement in the event we experienced stressed liquidity conditions. We periodically review and test the contingency funding plans to validate efficacy and assess readiness. Our U.S. bank subsidiaries can access contingency funding through the Federal Reserve Discount Window. Certain non-U.S. subsidiaries have access to central bank facilities in the jurisdictions in which they operate. While we do not rely on these sources in our liquidity modeling, we maintain the policies, procedures and governance processes that would enable us to access these sources if necessary. Credit Ratings Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating agencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other securities, including asset securitizations. Table 21 presents the Corporation's current long-term/short-term senior debt ratings and outlooks expressed by the rating agencies. These ratings have not changed from those disclosed in the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information on credit ratings, see Liquidity Risk Credit Ratings in the MD&A of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K .

Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Credit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower credit cycle. Statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio management including underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting credit limits, and establishing operating processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns. Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources such as credit bureaus and/or internal historical experience. These models are a component of our consumer credit risk management process and are used in part to assist in making both new and ongoing credit decisions, as well as portfolio management strategies, including authorizations and line management, collection practices and strategies, and determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allocated capital for credit risk. Consumer Credit Portfolio Improvement in the U.S. unemployment rate and home prices continued during the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 resulting in improved credit quality and lower credit losses in the consumer real estate portfolio compared to the same periods in 2016 . The 30 and 90 days or more past due balances declined across most consumer loan portfolios during the six months ended June 30, 2017 as a result of improved delinquency trends. The sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business, improved credit quality, continued loan balance run-off and sales in the consumer real estate portfolio drove a $527 million decrease in the consumer allowance for loan and lease losses during the six months ended June 30, 2017 to $5.7 billion at June 30, 2017 . For additional information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 57 .

Table 22 presents our outstanding consumer loans and leases, and the PCI loan portfolio. In addition to being included in the Outstandings columns in Table 22 , PCI loans are also shown separately in the Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio columns. The impact of the PCI loan portfolio on certain credit statistics is reported where appropriate.

Nonperforming loans do not include past due consumer credit card loans, other unsecured loans and in general, consumer loans not secured by real estate (loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy are included) as these loans are typically charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due. Real estate-secured past due consumer loans that are insured by the FHA or individually insured under long-term standby agreements with FNMA and FHLMC (collectively, the fully-insured loan portfolio) are reported as accruing as opposed to nonperforming since the principal repayment is insured. Fully-insured loans included in accruing past due 90 days or more are primarily from our repurchases of delinquent FHA loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA. Additionally, nonperforming loans and accruing balances past due 90 days or more do not include the PCI loan portfolio or loans accounted for under the fair value option even though the customer may be contractually past due.

(2) Balances exclude consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option.

(2) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as annualized net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans and leases excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option. Net charge-offs, as shown in Tables 24 and 25 , exclude write-offs in the PCI loan portfolio of $41 million and $50 million in residential mortgage for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to $37 million and $76 million for the same periods in 2016 . Net charge-offs, as shown in Tables 24 and 25 , exclude write-offs in the PCI loan portfolio of $14 million and $38 million in home equity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to $45 million and $111 million for the same periods in 2016 . Net charge-off ratios including the PCI write-offs were 0.04 percent and 0.05 percent for residential mortgage for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to 0.15 percent and 0.22 percent for the same periods in 2016 . Net charge-off ratios including the PCI write-offs were 0.41 percent and 0.48 percent for home equity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to 0.95 percent for both periods in 2016 . For more information on PCI write-offs, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio on page 45 . Bank of America 40 Table 25 presents outstandings, nonperforming balances, net charge-offs, allowance for loan and lease losses and provision for loan and lease losses for the core and non-core portfolios within the consumer real estate portfolio. We categorize consumer real estate loans as core and non-core based on loan and customer characteristics such as origination date, product type, LTV, FICO score and delinquency status consistent with our current consumer and mortgage servicing strategy. Generally, loans that were originated after January 1, 2010, qualified under government-sponsored enterprise underwriting guidelines, or otherwise met our underwriting guidelines in place in 2015 are characterized as core loans. Loans held in legacy private-label securitizations, government-insured loans originated prior to 2010, loan products no longer originated, and loans originated prior to 2010 and classified as nonperforming or modified in a TDR prior to 2016 are generally characterized as non-core loans, and are principally run-off portfolios. Core loans as reported in Table 25 include loans held in the Consumer Banking and GWIM segments, as well as loans held for ALM activities in All Other . For more information on core and non-core loans, see Note 4 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements . As shown in Table 25 , outstanding core consumer real estate loans increased $7.0 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2017 driven by an increase of $9.7 billion in residential mortgage, partially offset by a $2.7 billion decrease in home equity. The increase in residential mortgage was due to a decision to retain a higher percentage of residential mortgage production in Consumer Banking and GWIM . The decrease in home equity was driven by paydowns outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines.

For more information on the fair value option, see Note 15 Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements . (2) Net charge-offs exclude write-offs in the PCI loan portfolio. For more information on PCI write-offs, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio on page 45 . We believe that the presentation of information adjusted to exclude the impact of the PCI loan portfolio, the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option is more representative of the ongoing operations and credit quality of the business. As a result, in the following discussions of the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios, we provide information that excludes the impact of the PCI loan portfolio, the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option in certain credit quality statistics. We separately disclose information on the PCI loan portfolio on page 45 . 41 Bank of America Residential Mortgage The residential mortgage portfolio makes up the largest percentage of our consumer loan portfolio at 44 percent of consumer loans and leases at June 30, 2017 . Approximately 35 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio is in GWIM and represents residential mortgages originated for the home purchase and refinancing needs of our wealth management clients. Approximately 32 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio is in All Other and is comprised of originated loans, purchased loans used in our overall ALM activities, delinquent FHA loans repurchased pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA as well as loans repurchased related to our representations and warranties. The remaining portion of the portfolio is primarily in Consumer Banking . Outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, increased $5.6 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2017 as retention of new originations was partially offset by loan sales of $1.7 billion, and run-off. At June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , the residential mortgage portfolio included $26.1 billion and $28.7 billion of outstanding fully-insured loans. On this portion of the residential mortgage portfolio, we are protected against principal loss as a result of either FHA insurance or long-term standby agreements that provide for the transfer of credit risk to FNMA and FHLMC. At June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , $19.5 billion and $22.3 billion had FHA insurance with the remainder protected by long-term standby agreements. At June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , $6.0 billion and $7.4 billion of the FHA-insured loan population were repurchases of delinquent FHA loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA. Table 26 presents certain residential mortgage key credit statistics on both a reported basis excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, and excluding the PCI loan portfolio, our fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option. Additionally, in the Reported Basis columns in the table below, accruing balances past due and nonperforming loans do not include the PCI loan portfolio, in accordance with our accounting policies, even though the customer may be contractually past due. As such, the following discussion presents the residential mortgage portfolio excluding the PCI loan portfolio, the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option. For more information on the PCI loan portfolio, see page 45 .

(2) These vintages of loans account for $855 million, or 33 percent , and $931 million, or 31 percent , of nonperforming residential mortgage loans at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 . (3) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as annualized net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option. Nonperforming residential mortgage loans decreased $477 million during the six months ended June 30, 2017 as outflows, including sales of $242 million, outpaced new inflows. Of the nonperforming residential mortgage loans at June 30, 2017 , $857 million, or 33 percent, were current on contractual payments. Loans accruing past due 30 days or more decreased $568 million primarily due to an improvement in collections associated with the consumer real estate servicer conversion that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2016. Net charge-offs decreased $53 million to a $19 million net recovery and decreased $127 million to a $2 million net recovery for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 , compared to the same periods in 2016 . These decreases in net charge-offs were primarily driven by favorable portfolio trends and decreased write-downs on loans greater than 180 days past due driven by improvement in home prices and the U.S. economy. Additionally, net charge-offs declined due to net recoveries of $14 million related to nonperforming loan sales during the six months ended June 30, 2017 , compared to nonperforming loan sale-related charge-offs of $42 million for the same period in 2016 . Loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent represented two percent and three percent of the residential mortgage loan portfolio at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 . Of the loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent, 99 percent and 98 percent were performing at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 . Loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent reflect loans where the outstanding carrying value of the loan is greater than the most recent valuation of the property securing the loan. The majority of these loans have a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent primarily due to home price deterioration since 2006, partially offset by subsequent appreciation. Bank of America 42 Of the $162.1 billion in total residential mortgage loans outstanding at June 30, 2017 , as shown in Table 27 , 35 percent were originated as interest-only loans. The outstanding balance of interest-only residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period was $10.9 billion, or 19 percent, at June 30, 2017 . Residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period generally have experienced a higher rate of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status compared to the residential mortgage portfolio as a whole. At June 30, 2017 , $234 million, or two percent of outstanding interest-only residential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $1.3 billion , or one percent for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, at June 30, 2017 , $459 million, or four percent of outstanding interest-only residential mortgage loans that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming, of which $242 million were contractually current, compared to $2.6 billion , or two percent for the entire residential mortgage portfolio, of which $857 million were contractually current. Loans that have yet to enter the amortization period in our interest-only residential mortgage portfolio are primarily well-collateralized loans to our wealth management clients and have an interest-only period of three to ten years. More than 80 percent of these loans that have yet to enter the amortization period will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2020 or later. Table 27 presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the residential mortgage portfolio. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) within California represented 16 percent and 15 percent of outstandings at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 . In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 12 percent of outstandings at both June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 .

(5) At June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , 47 percent and 48 percent of PCI residential mortgage loans were in California. There were no other significant single state concentrations. Home Equity At June 30, 2017 , the home equity portfolio made up 14 percent of the consumer portfolio and is comprised of home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), home equity loans and reverse mortgages. At June 30, 2017 , our HELOC portfolio had an outstanding balance of $54.7 billion , or 88 percent of the total home equity portfolio compared to $58.6 billion, also 88 percent, at December 31, 2016 . HELOCs generally have an initial draw period of 10 years and the borrowers typically are only required to pay the interest due on the loans on a monthly basis. After the initial draw period ends, the loans generally convert to 15-year amortizing loans. At June 30, 2017 , our home equity loan portfolio had an outstanding balance of $5.1 billion , or eight percent of the total home equity portfolio compared to $5.9 billion, or nine percent, at December 31, 2016 . Home equity loans are almost all fixed-rate loans with amortizing payment terms of 10 to 30 years and of the $5.1 billion at June 30, 2017 , 57 percent have 25- to 30-year terms. At June 30, 2017 , our reverse mortgage portfolio had an outstanding balance, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, of $2.1 billion , or four percent of the total home equity portfolio compared to $1.9 billion, or three percent, at December 31, 2016 . We no longer originate reverse mortgages. At June 30, 2017 , approximately 68 percent of the home equity portfolio was in Consumer Banking , 25 percent was in All Other and the remainder of the portfolio was primarily in GWIM . Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, decreased $4.5 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2017 primarily due to paydowns and charge-offs outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines. Of the total home equity portfolio at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , $19.2 billion and $19.6 billion, or 31 percent and 29 percent, were in first-lien positions ( 33 percent and 31 percent excluding the PCI home equity portfolio). At June 30, 2017 , outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio that were in a second-lien or more junior-lien position and where we also held the first-lien loan totaled $10.2 billion, or 17 percent of our total home equity portfolio excluding the PCI loan portfolio. Unused HELOCs totaled $45.8 billion at June 30, 2017 compared to $47.2 billion at December 31, 2016 . The decrease was primarily due to accounts reaching the end of their draw period, which automatically eliminates open line exposure, and customers choosing to close accounts. Both of these more than offset the impact of new production. The HELOC utilization rate was 54 43 Bank of America percent at June 30, 2017 compared to 55 percent at December 31, 2016 . Table 28 presents certain home equity portfolio key credit statistics on both a reported basis excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, and excluding the PCI loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option. Additionally, in the Reported Basis columns in the table below, accruing balances past due 30 days or more and nonperforming loans do not include the PCI loan portfolio, in accordance with our accounting policies, even though the customer may be contractually past due. As such, the following discussion presents the home equity portfolio excluding the PCI loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option. For more information on the PCI loan portfolio, see page 45 .

(2) Accruing past due 30 days or more includes $65 million and $81 million and nonperforming loans include $324 million and $340 million of loans where we serviced the underlying first-lien at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 . (3) These vintages of loans have higher refreshed combined LTV ratios and accounted for 52 percent and 50 percent of nonperforming home equity loans at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , and 92 percent and 90 percent of net charge-offs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 44 percent and 42 percent for the same periods in 2016. (4) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as annualized net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option. Nonperforming outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased $237 million during the six months ended June 30, 2017 as outflows, including $66 million of net transfers to held-for-sale and $20 million of sales outpaced new inflows. Of the nonperforming home equity portfolio at June 30, 2017 , $1.4 billion, or 53 percent, were current on contractual payments. Nonperforming loans that are contractually current primarily consist of collateral-dependent TDRs, including those that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, junior-lien loans where the underlying first-lien is 90 days or more past due, as well as loans that have not yet demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance following a TDR. In addition, $771 million, or 29 percent of nonperforming home equity loans, were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell. Accruing loans that were 30 days or more past due decreased $70 million during the six months ended June 30, 2017 , primarily due to continued portfolio improvement and a consumer real estate servicer conversion that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2016. In some cases, the junior-lien home equity outstanding balance that we hold is performing, but the underlying first-lien is not. For outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio on which we service the first-lien loan, we are able to track whether the first-lien loan is in default. For loans where the first-lien is serviced by a third party, we utilize credit bureau data to estimate the delinquency status of the first-lien. Given that the credit bureau database we use does not include a property address for the mortgages, we are unable to identify with certainty whether a reported delinquent first-lien mortgage pertains to the same property for which we hold a junior-lien loan. For certain loans, we utilize a third-party vendor to combine credit bureau and public record data to better link a junior-lien loan with the underlying first-lien mortgage. At June 30, 2017 , we estimate that $870 million of current and $139 million of 30 to 89 days past due junior-lien loans were behind a delinquent first-lien loan. We service the first-lien loans on $147 million of these combined amounts, with the remaining $862 million serviced by third parties. Of the $1.0 billion of current to 89 days past due junior-lien loans, based on available credit bureau data and our own internal servicing data, we estimate that approximately $374 million had first-lien loans that were 90 days or more past due. Net charge-offs decreased $76 million to $50 million and decreased $124 million to $114 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to same periods in 2016 . These decreases in net charge-offs were driven by favorable portfolio trends due in part to improvement in home prices and the U.S. economy. Outstanding balances with refreshed combined loan-to-value (CLTV) greater than 100 percent comprised six percent and seven percent of the home equity portfolio at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 . Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent reflect loans where our loan and available line of credit combined with any outstanding senior liens against the property are equal to or greater than the most recent valuation of the property securing the loan. Depending on the value of the property, there may be collateral in excess of the first-lien that is available to reduce the severity of loss on the second-lien. Of those outstanding balances with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent, 95 percent of the customers were current on their home equity loan and 91 percent Bank of America 44 of second-lien loans with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent were current on both their second-lien and underlying first-lien loans at June 30, 2017 . Of the $58.8 billion in total home equity portfolio outstandings at June 30, 2017 , as shown in Table 29 , 40 percent require interest-only payments. The outstanding balance of HELOCs that have entered the amortization period was $16.9 billion at June 30, 2017 . The HELOCs that have entered the amortization period have experienced a higher percentage of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status when compared to the HELOC portfolio as a whole. At June 30, 2017 , $309 million, or two percent of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more. In addition, at June 30, 2017 , $1.9 billion, or 11 percent of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming, of which $998 million were contractually current. Loans in our HELOC portfolio generally have an initial draw period of 10 years and 10 percent of these loans will enter the amortization period in the remainder of 2017 and will be required to make fully-amortizing payments. We communicate to contractually current customers more than a year prior to the end of their draw period to inform them of the potential change to the payment structure before entering the amortization period, and provide payment options to customers prior to the end of the draw period. Although we do not actively track how many of our home equity customers pay only the minimum amount due on their home equity loans and lines, we can infer some of this information through a review of our HELOC portfolio that we service and that is still in its revolving period (i.e., customers may draw on and repay their line of credit, but are generally only required to pay interest on a monthly basis). During the three months ended June 30, 2017 , approximately 37 percent of these customers with an outstanding balance did not pay any principal on their HELOCs. Table 29 presents outstandings, nonperforming balances and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the home equity portfolio. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 13 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 . For the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 , loans within this MSA contributed 29 percent and 24 percent of net charge-offs within the home equity portfolio compared to 18 percent and 16 percent of net charge-offs for the same periods in 2016 . The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California made up 11 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 . For the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 , loans within this MSA contributed net recoveries of $5 million and $8 million within the home equity portfolio compared to a net recovery of $1 million and a net charge-off of $1 million for the same periods in 2016 .

This includes $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion of loans that were credit-impaired upon acquisition and $161 million and $226 million of loans that are 90 days or more past due at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 . The total unpaid principal balance of pay option loans with accumulated negative amortization was $229 million and $303 million, including $12 million and $16 million of negative amortization at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 . The total PCI unpaid principal balance decreased $1.3 billion , or 10 percent , during the six months ended June 30, 2017 primarily driven by payoffs, paydowns and write-offs. During the six months ended June 30, 2017 , we sold PCI loans with a carrying value of $204 million compared to sales of $324 million for the same period in 2016 . Of the unpaid principal balance of $12.7 billion at June 30, 2017 , $11.4 billion, or 90 percent, was current based on the contractual terms, $739 million, or six percent, was in early stage delinquency, and $432 million was 180 days or more past due, including $367 million of first-lien mortgages and $65 million of home equity loans. The PCI residential mortgage loan portfolio represented 75 percent of the total PCI loan portfolio at June 30, 2017 . Those loans to borrowers with a refreshed FICO score below 620 represented 25 percent of the PCI residential mortgage loan portfolio at June 30, 2017 . Loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 90 percent, after consideration of purchase accounting adjustments and the related valuation allowance, represented 20 percent of the PCI residential mortgage loan portfolio and 23 percent based on the unpaid principal balance at June 30, 2017 . The PCI home equity portfolio represented 25 percent of the total PCI loan portfolio at June 30, 2017 . Those loans with a refreshed FICO score below 620 represented 16 percent of the PCI home equity portfolio at June 30, 2017 . Loans with a refreshed CLTV greater than 90 percent, after consideration of purchase accounting adjustments and the related valuation allowance, represented 43 percent of the PCI home equity portfolio and 46 percent based on the unpaid principal balance at June 30, 2017 . U.S. Credit Card At June 30, 2017 , 97 percent of the U.S. credit card portfolio was managed in Consumer Banking with the remainder in GWIM . Outstandings in the U.S. credit card portfolio decreased $1.5 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2017 due to paydowns and a seasonal decline in purchase volume. Net charge-offs increased $67 million to $640 million and $86 million to $1.2 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same periods in 2016 due to portfolio seasoning and loan growth. U.S. credit card loans 30 days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased $45 million and loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased $10 million during the six months ended June 30, 2017 , driven by seasonal declines. Unused lines of credit for U.S. credit card totaled $328.9 billion and $321.6 billion at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 . The increase was driven by a seasonal decrease in line utilization due to a decrease in transaction volume as well as account growth and lines of credit increases.

For more information on the sale, see Recent Events on page 3 and Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Bank of America 46 Direct/Indirect Consumer At June 30, 2017 , approximately 54 percent of the direct/indirect portfolio was included in Consumer Banking (consumer auto and specialty lending automotive, marine, aircraft, recreational vehicle loans and consumer personal loans) and 46 percent was included in GWIM (principally securities-based lending loans). Outstandings in the direct/indirect portfolio decreased $596 million during the six months ended June 30, 2017 primarily driven by lower draws and utilization in the securities-based lending portfolio. Table 32 presents certain state concentrations for the direct/indirect consumer loan portfolio.

The remainder is primarily associated with certain consumer finance businesses that we previously exited. Nonperforming Consumer Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity Table 33 presents nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 . For more information on nonperforming loans, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 4 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements . During the six months ended June 30, 2017 , nonperforming consumer loans declined $722 million to $5.3 billion driven in part by loan sales of $261 million and net transfers of loans to held-for-sale of $198 million. Additionally, nonperforming loans declined as outflows outpaced new inflows. The outstanding balance of a real estate-secured loan that is in excess of the estimated property value less costs to sell is charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due unless repayment of the loan is fully insured. At June 30, 2017 , $2.1 billion, or 39 percent of nonperforming consumer real estate loans and foreclosed properties had been written down to their estimated property value less costs to sell, including $1.9 billion of nonperforming loans 180 days or more past due and $285 million of foreclosed properties. In addition, at June 30, 2017 , $2.3 billion, or 43 percent of nonperforming consumer loans were modified and are now current after successful trial periods, or are current loans classified as nonperforming loans in accordance with applicable policies. Foreclosed properties decreased $78 million during the six months ended June 30, 2017 as liquidations outpaced additions. PCI loans are excluded from nonperforming loans as these loans were written down to fair value at the acquisition date; however, once we acquire the underlying real estate upon foreclosure of the delinquent PCI loan, it is included in foreclosed properties. Not included in foreclosed properties at June 30, 2017 was $1.0 billion of real estate that was acquired upon foreclosure of certain delinquent government-guaranteed loans (principally FHA-insured loans). We exclude these amounts from our nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties activity as we expect we will be reimbursed once the property is conveyed to the guarantor for principal and, up to certain limits, costs incurred during the foreclosure process and interest incurred during the holding period. Nonperforming loans also include certain loans that have been modified in TDRs where economic concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. These concessions typically result from our loss mitigation activities and could include reductions in the interest rate, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance or other actions. Certain TDRs are classified as nonperforming at the time of restructuring and may only be returned to performing status after considering the borrower sustained repayment performance for a reasonable period, generally six months. Nonperforming TDRs, excluding those modified loans in the PCI loan portfolio, are included in Table 33 . 47 Bank of America Table 33 Nonperforming Consumer Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity (1) Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 (Dollars in millions) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Nonperforming loans and leases, beginning of period $ 5,546 $ 7,247 $ 6,004 $ 8,165 Additions 682 799 1,500 1,750 Reductions: Paydowns and payoffs (170 ) (252 ) (400 ) (385 ) Sales (119 ) (271 ) (261 ) (1,094 ) Returns to performing status (2) (368 ) (396 ) (754 ) (837 ) Charge-offs (259 ) (334 ) (499 ) (729 ) Transfers to foreclosed properties (53 ) (88 ) (110 ) (165 ) Transfers (to) / from loans held-for-sale 23 (198 ) Total net reductions to nonperforming loans and leases (264 ) (542 ) (722 ) (1,460 ) Total nonperforming loans and leases, June 30 (3) 5,282 6,705 5,282 6,705 Total foreclosed properties, June 30 (4) 285 416 285 416 Nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties, June 30 $ 5,567 $ 7,121 $ 5,567 $ 7,121 Nonperforming consumer loans and leases as a percentage of outstanding consumer loans and leases (5) 1.18 % 1.49 % Nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties as a percentage of outstanding consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties (5) 1.24 1.58 (1) Balances do not include nonperforming LHFS of $4 million and $20 million and nonaccruing TDRs removed from the PCI loan portfolio prior to January 1, 2010 of $22 million and $38 million at June 30, 2017 and 2016 as well as loans accruing past due 90 days or more as presented in Table 23 and Note 4 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements . (2) Consumer loans may be returned to performing status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected, or when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection. (3) At June 30, 2017 , 35 percent of nonperforming loans were 180 days or more past due. (4) Foreclosed property balances do not include properties insured by certain government-guaranteed loans, principally FHA-insured loans, of $1.0 billion and $1.3 billion at June 30, 2017 and 2016 . (5) Outstanding consumer loans and leases exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. We classify junior-lien home equity loans as nonperforming when the first-lien loan becomes 90 days past due even if the junior-lien loan is performing. At June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , $374 million and $428 million of such junior-lien home equity loans were included in nonperforming loans and leases. Table 34 presents TDRs for the consumer real estate portfolio. Performing TDR balances are excluded from nonperforming loans and leases in Table 33 . Table 34 Consumer Real Estate Troubled Debt Restructurings June 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 (Dollars in millions) Total Nonperforming Performing Total Nonperforming Performing Residential mortgage (1, 2) $ 11,120 $ 1,686 $ 9,434 $ 12,631 $ 1,992 $ 10,639 Home equity (3) 2,873 1,536 1,337 2,777 1,566 1,211 Total consumer real estate troubled debt restructurings $ 13,993 $ 3,222 $ 10,771 $ 15,408 $ 3,558 $ 11,850 (1) At June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , residential mortgage TDRs deemed collateral dependent totaled $3.1 billion and $3.5 billion , and included $1.3 billion and $1.6 billion of loans classified as nonperforming and $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion of loans classified as performing. (2) Residential mortgage performing TDRs included $4.4 billion and $5.3 billion of loans that were fully-insured at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 . (3) Home equity TDRs deemed collateral dependent totaled $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion , and included $1.3 billion of loans classified as nonperforming for both periods, and $353 million and $301 million of loans classified as performing at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , respectively. In addition to modifying consumer real estate loans, we work with customers who are experiencing financial difficulty by modifying credit card and other consumer loans. Credit card and other consumer loan modifications generally involve a reduction in the customer interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months, all of which are considered TDRs (the renegotiated TDR portfolio). Modifications of credit card and other consumer loans are made through renegotiation programs utilizing direct customer contact, but may also utilize external renegotiation programs. The renegotiated TDR portfolio is excluded in large part from Table 33 as substantially all of the loans remain on accrual status until either charged off or paid in full. At June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , our renegotiated TDR portfolio was $478 million and $610 million , of which $427 million and $493 million were current or less than 30 days past due under the modified terms. The decline in the renegotiated TDR portfolio was primarily driven by paydowns and charge-offs as well as lower program enrollments. For more information on the renegotiated TDR portfolio, see Note 4 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Commercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal that concentrations of credit exposure do not result in undesirable levels of risk. We review, measure and manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, customer relationship and loan size. We also review, measure and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property type. In addition, within our non-U.S. portfolio, we evaluate exposures by region and by country. Tables 39 , 42 and 47 summarize our concentrations. We also utilize syndications of exposure to third parties, loan sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio. For more information on our industry concentrations, including our utilized exposure to the energy sector, which was three percent of total commercial utilized exposure at both June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , see Bank of America 48 Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Industry Concentrations on page 53 and Table 42 . For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status and net charge-offs for the commercial portfolio, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Commercial Credit Portfolio During the six months ended June 30, 2017 , other than in the higher risk energy sub-sectors, credit quality among large corporate borrowers was strong. We saw further improvement in the energy sector in the six months ended June 30, 2017 . Credit quality of commercial real estate borrowers continued to be strong with conservative LTV ratios, stable market rents in most sectors and vacancy rates remaining low. Outstanding commercial loans and leases increased $10.8 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2017 primarily in U.S. commercial. Nonperforming commercial loans and leases decreased $232 million to $1.6 billion and reservable criticized balances decreased $680 million to $15.6 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2017 driven by improvements in the energy sector. The allowance for loan and lease losses for the commercial portfolio decreased $78 million to $5.2 billion at June 30, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 . For additional information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 57 .

For more information on the fair value option, see Note 15 Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Table 36 presents net charge-offs and related ratios for our commercial loans and leases for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 . The decrease in net charge-offs of $23 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 was primarily due to lower energy sector related losses.

Table 37 presents commercial credit exposure by type for utilized, unfunded and total binding committed credit exposure. Commercial utilized credit exposure includes standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and financial guarantees, bankers acceptances and commercial letters of credit that have been issued and for which we are legally bound to advance funds under prescribed conditions during a specified time period and excludes exposure related to trading account assets. Although funds have not yet been advanced, these exposure types are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes. 49 Bank of America Total commercial utilized credit exposure increased $8.5 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2017 primarily driven by increases in loans and leases. The utilization rate for loans and leases, SBLCs and financial guarantees, commercial letters of credit and bankers acceptances, in the aggregate, was 59 percent and 58 percent at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 .

(2) Commercial unfunded exposure includes commitments accounted for under the fair value option with a notional amount of $4.2 billion and $6.7 billion at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 . (3) Excludes unused business card lines which are not legally binding. (4) Includes the notional amount of unfunded legally binding lending commitments net of amounts distributed (e.g., syndicated or participated) to other financial institutions. The distributed amounts were $11.6 billion and $12.1 billion at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 . (5) Includes credit risk exposure associated with assets under operating lease arrangements of $5.9 billion and $5.7 billion at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 . (6) Derivative assets are carried at fair value, reflect the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and have been reduced by cash collateral of $34.6 billion and $43.3 billion at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 . Not reflected in utilized and committed exposure is additional non-cash derivative collateral held of $25.5 billion and $25.3 billion at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , which consists primarily of other marketable securities. Table 38 presents commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure by loan type. Criticized exposure corresponds to the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful asset categories as defined by regulatory authorities. Total commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure decreased $680 million , or four percent , during the six months ended June 30, 2017 primarily driven by paydowns and net upgrades in the energy portfolio. Approximately 77 percent and 76 percent of commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure was secured at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 .

(2) Percentages are calculated as commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure divided by total commercial utilized reservable exposure for each exposure category. U.S. Commercial At June 30, 2017 , 71 percent of the U.S. commercial loan portfolio, excluding small business, was managed in Global Banking, 17 percent in Global Markets , 11 percent in GWIM (generally business-purpose loans for high net worth clients) and the remainder primarily in Consumer Banking . U.S. commercial loans, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, increased $7.3 billion , or three percent , during the six months ended June 30, 2017 due to growth across most of the commercial businesses. Reservable criticized balances decreased $282 million, or three percent, and nonperforming loans and leases decreased $217 million, or 17 percent, in the six months ended June 30, 2017 driven by improvements in the energy sector. Net charge-offs increased $24 million and $3 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same periods in 2016 . The three month increase was primarily driven by a single energy client loss. Commercial Real Estate Commercial real estate primarily includes commercial loans and leases secured by non-owner-occupied real estate and is dependent on the sale or lease of the real estate as the primary source of repayment. The portfolio remains diversified across property types and geographic regions. California represented the largest state concentration at 24 percent and 23 percent of the commercial real estate loans and leases portfolio at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 . The commercial real estate portfolio is predominantly managed in Global Banking and consists of loans made primarily to public and private developers, and commercial real estate firms. Outstanding loans increased $1.8 billion , or three percent , during the six months ended June 30, 2017 due to new originations outpacing paydowns. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 , we continued to see low default rates and solid credit quality in both the residential and non-residential portfolios. We use a number of Bank of America 50 proactive risk mitigation initiatives to reduce adversely rated exposure in the commercial real estate portfolio, including transfers of deteriorating exposures to management by independent special asset officers and the pursuit of loan restructurings or asset sales to achieve the best results for our customers and the Corporation. Nonperforming commercial real estate loans and foreclosed properties increased $77 million, or 90 percent, driven by a small number of clients across property types. Reservable criticized balances increased $ 243 million , or 61 percent , during the six months ended June 30, 2017 primarily due to loan downgrades. Net charge-offs were $5 million and $1 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to net recoveries of $2 million and $8 million for the same periods in 2016. Table 39 presents outstanding commercial real estate loans by geographic region, based on the geographic location of the collateral, and by property type.

At June 30, 2017 , total committed non-residential exposure was $78.3 billion compared to $76.9 billion at December 31, 2016 , of which $57.7 billion and $55.7 billion were funded loans. Non-residential nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties increased $77 million, or 95 percent, to $158 million at June 30, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 driven by a small number of clients across property types. The non-residential nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties represented 0.27 percent and 0.14 percent of total non-residential loans and foreclosed properties at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 . Non-residential utilized reservable criticized exposure increased $229 million, or 58 percent, to $626 million at June 30, 2017 compared to $397 million at December 31, 2016 , which represented 1.06 percent and 0.70 percent of non-residential utilized reservable exposure. For the non-residential portfolio, net charge-offs increased $6 million to $5 million and increased $8 million to $1 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same periods in 2016 . At June 30, 2017 , total committed residential exposure was $3.3 billion compared to $3.7 billion at December 31, 2016 , of which $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion were funded secured loans. The nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties and the utilized reservable criticized ratios for the residential portfolio were 0.32 percent and 1.09 percent at June 30, 2017 compared to 0.35 percent and 0.16 percent at December 31, 2016 . At June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , the commercial real estate loan portfolio included $7.1 billion and $6.8 billion of funded construction and land development loans that were originated to fund the construction and/or rehabilitation of commercial properties. Reservable criticized construction and land development loans totaled $262 million and $107 million, and nonperforming construction and land development loans and foreclosed properties totaled $55 million and $44 million at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 . During a property construction phase, interest income is typically paid from interest reserves that are established at the inception of the loan. As construction is completed and the property is put into service, these interest reserves are depleted and interest payments from operating cash flows begin. We do not recognize interest income on nonperforming loans regardless of the existence of an interest reserve. 51 Bank of America Non-U.S. Commercial At June 30, 2017 , 78 percent of the non-U.S. commercial loan portfolio was managed in Global Banking and 22 percent in Global Markets . Outstanding loans, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, increased $1.4 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2017 . Net charge-offs increased $1 million to $46 million and decreased $26 million to $61 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same periods in 2016 . The six month decrease was primarily due to a decline in energy sector related losses. For more information on the non-U.S. commercial portfolio, see Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 56 . U.S. Small Business Commercial The U.S. small business commercial loan portfolio is comprised of small business card loans and small business loans managed in Consumer Banking . Credit card-related products were 50 percent and 48 percent of the U.S. small business commercial portfolio at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 . Net charge-offs increased $3 million to $53 million and increased $3 million to $105 million and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same periods in 2016 . Of the U.S. small business commercial net charge-offs, 89 percent and 88 percent were credit card-related products for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to 87 percent and 88 percent for the same periods in 2016. Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity Table 40 presents the nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity during the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 . Nonperforming loans do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 , nonperforming commercial loans and leases decreased $208 million and $183 million to $1.5 billion . Approximately 76 percent of commercial nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties were secured and approximately 63 percent were contractually current. Commercial nonperforming loans were carried at approximately 86 percent of their unpaid principal balance before consideration of the allowance for loan and lease losses as the carrying value of these loans has been reduced to the estimated property value less costs to sell.

(3) Commercial loans and leases may be returned to performing status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected, or when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection. TDRs are generally classified as performing after a sustained period of demonstrated payment performance. (4) New foreclosed properties represents transfers of nonperforming loans to foreclosed properties net of charge-offs recorded during the first 90 days after transfer of a loan to foreclosed properties. (5) Outstanding commercial loans exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. Bank of America 52 Table 41 presents our commercial TDRs by product type and performing status. U.S. small business commercial TDRs are comprised of renegotiated small business card loans and small business loans. The renegotiated small business card loans are not classified as nonperforming as they are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due. For more information on TDRs, see Note 4 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements .

Our commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. Total commercial committed exposure decreased $3.2 billion , or less than one percent, during the six months ended June 30, 2017 to $947.9 billion . The decrease in commercial committed exposure was concentrated in the Healthcare Equipment and Services sector and the Banking sector. Decreases were partially offset by higher exposure to the Retailing sector and the Food, Beverage and Tobacco sector. Industry limits are used internally to manage industry concentrations and are based on committed exposure that is allocated on an industry-by-industry basis. A risk management framework is in place to set and approve industry limits as well as to provide ongoing monitoring. The Management Risk Committee oversees industry limit governance. Diversified Financials, our largest industry concentration, with committed exposure of $126.3 billion , increased $1.7 billion , or one percent , during the six months ended June 30, 2017 . The increase primarily reflected an increase in exposure to several counterparties. Real estate, our second largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $85.1 billion , increased $1.5 billion , or two percent , during the six months ended June 30, 2017 . For more information on the commercial real estate and related portfolios, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Commercial Real Estate on page 50 . Retailing committed exposure increased $5.9 billion , or nine percent , to $74.4 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2017 . The increase in committed exposure occurred primarily in the Internet and Catalog retail sector. Our energy-related committed exposure decreased $2.4 billion , or six percent , to $36.9 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2017 . Energy sector net charge-offs were $26 million during the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to $181 million for the same period in 2016. Energy sector reservable criticized exposure decreased $1.2 billion to $4.4 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2017 due to improvement in credit quality of some borrowers coupled with exposure reductions and fewer new criticized exposures. The energy allowance for credit losses decreased $115 million to $810 million during the six months ended June 30, 2017 . 53 Bank of America Table 42 Commercial Credit Exposure by Industry (1) Commercial Utilized Total Commercial Committed (2) (Dollars in millions) June 30 2017 December 31 2016 June 30 2017 December 31 2016 Diversified financials $ 80,979 $ 81,156 $ 126,267 $ 124,535 Real estate (3) 63,480 61,203 85,115 83,658 Retailing 42,841 41,630 74,396 68,507 Capital goods 34,373 34,278 66,302 64,202 Healthcare equipment and services 36,749 37,656 56,365 64,663 Government and public education 46,057 45,694 54,695 54,626 Materials 22,964 22,578 45,851 44,357 Banking 38,117 39,877 42,675 47,799 Food, beverage and tobacco 22,211 19,669 42,421 37,145 Consumer services 27,061 27,413 42,383 42,523 Energy 17,044 19,686 36,878 39,231 Commercial services and supplies 21,336 21,241 34,137 35,360 Transportation 20,917 19,805 28,886 27,483 Utilities 12,176 11,349 27,273 27,140 Media 13,195 13,419 24,911 27,116 Individuals and trusts 17,619 16,364 22,971 21,764 Pharmaceuticals and biotechnology 5,670 5,539 18,936 18,910 Software and services 9,164 7,991 18,361 19,790 Technology hardware and equipment 7,846 7,793 18,092 18,429 Telecommunication services 6,237 6,317 14,535 16,925 Consumer durables and apparel 6,400 6,042 12,161 11,460 Insurance, including monolines 6,049 7,406 11,938 13,936 Automobiles and components 5,391 5,459 11,546 12,969 Food and staples retailing 4,771 4,795 9,265 8,869 Religious and social organizations 4,259 4,423 6,071 6,252 Other 10,458 6,109 15,461 13,432 Total commercial credit exposure by industry $ 583,364 $ 574,892 $ 947,892 $ 951,081 Net credit default protection purchased on total commitments (4) $ (1,875 ) $ (3,477 ) (1) Includes U.S. small business commercial exposure.

(4) Represents net notional credit protection purchased. For additional information, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Risk Mitigation below. Risk Mitigation We purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. To lower the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, we may add credit exposure within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. At June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, was $1.9 billion and $3.5 billion . We recorded net losses of $16 million and $47 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to net losses of $125 million and $328 million for the same periods in 2016 on these positions. The gains and losses on these instruments were offset by gains and losses on the related exposures. The Value-at-Risk (VaR) results for these exposures are included in the fair value option portfolio information in Table 50 . For additional information, see Trading Risk Management on page 60 .

(4) NR is comprised of index positions held and any names that have not been rated. In addition to our net notional credit default protection purchased to cover the funded and unfunded portion of certain credit exposures, credit derivatives are used for market-making activities for clients and establishing positions intended to profit from directional or relative value changes. We execute the majority of our credit derivative trades in the OTC market with large, multinational financial institutions, including broker-dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety of other investors. Because these transactions are executed in the OTC market, we are subject to settlement risk. We are also subject to credit risk in the event that these counterparties fail to perform under the terms of these contracts. In most cases, credit derivative transactions are executed on a daily margin basis. Therefore, events such as a credit downgrade, depending on the ultimate rating level, or a breach of credit covenants would typically require an increase in the amount of collateral required by the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow us to take additional protective measures such as early termination of all trades. Table 45 presents the total contract/notional amount of credit derivatives outstanding and includes both purchased and written credit derivatives. The credit risk amounts are measured as net asset exposure by counterparty, taking into consideration all contracts with the counterparty. For more information on our written credit derivatives, see Note 2 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . The credit risk amounts discussed above and presented in Table 45 take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements while amounts disclosed in Note 2 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements are shown on a gross basis. Credit risk reflects the potential benefit from offsetting exposure to non-credit derivative products with the same counterparties that may be netted upon the occurrence of certain events, thereby reducing our overall exposure.

We calculate CVA based on a modeled expected exposure that incorporates current market risk factors including changes in market spreads and non-credit related market factors that affect the value of a derivative. The exposure also takes into consideration credit mitigants such as legally enforceable master netting agreements and collateral. For additional information, see Note 2 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . We enter into risk management activities to offset market driven exposures. We often hedge the counterparty spread risk in CVA with credit default swaps (CDS). We hedge other market risks in CVA primarily with currency and interest rate swaps. In certain instances, the net-of-hedge amounts in the following table move in the same direction as the gross amount or may move in the opposite direction. This movement is a consequence of the complex interaction of the risks being hedged, resulting in limitations in the ability to perfectly hedge all of the market exposures at all times.

We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in government policies. A risk management framework is in place to measure, monitor and manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. In addition to the direct risk of doing business in a country, we also are exposed to indirect country risks (e.g., related to the collateral received on secured financing transactions or related to client clearing activities). These indirect exposures are managed in the normal course of business through credit, market and operational risk governance, rather than through country risk governance. Table 47 presents our 20 largest non-U.S. country exposures as of June 30, 2017 . These exposures accounted for 88 percent of our total non-U.S. exposure at both June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 . Net country exposure for these 20 countries decreased $4.2 billion in the six months ended June 30, 2017 primarily driven by decreases in the U.K., Switzerland, Japan, Italy and Brazil, partially offset by increases in the Netherlands, South Korea and Australia. On a product basis, the decrease was driven by the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business, lower unfunded commitments in Switzerland, and lower funded commitments in Japan, Italy and Brazil. These reductions were partially offset by higher funded commitments in the Netherlands and Australia, and increased securities exposure in South Korea. Non-U.S. exposure is presented on an internal risk management basis and includes sovereign and non-sovereign credit exposure, securities and other investments issued by or domiciled in countries other than the U.S. Funded loans and loan equivalents include loans, leases, and other extensions of credit and funds, including letters of credit and due from placements, which have not been reduced by collateral, hedges or credit default protection. Unfunded commitments are the undrawn portion of legally binding commitments related to loans and loan equivalents. Net counterparty exposure includes the fair value of derivatives, including the counterparty risk associated with CDS, and secured financing transactions. Securities and other investments are carried at fair value and long securities exposures are netted against short exposures with the same underlying issuer to, but not below, zero (i.e., negative issuer exposures are reported as zero). Net country exposure represents country exposure less hedges and credit default protection purchased, net of credit default protection sold.

Our two largest emerging market country exposures at June 30, 2017 were Brazil and China. At June 30, 2017 , net exposure to Brazil was $12.4 billion , concentrated in sovereign securities, oil and gas companies and commercial banks. At June 30, 2017 , net exposure to China was $12.0 billion , concentrated in large state-owned companies, subsidiaries of multinational corporations and commercial banks. The outlook for policy direction and therefore economic performance in the EU remains uncertain as a consequence of reduced political cohesion among EU countries. In addition, the results of the accelerated elections in the U.K. in June 2017 have increased uncertainty on the U.K.'s ability to negotiate its exit from the EU in a favorable manner. Our largest EU country exposure at June 30, 2017 was the U.K. At June 30, 2017 , net exposure to the U.K. was $38.6 billion , concentrated in multinational corporations and sovereign clients. For additional information, see Bank of America 56 Executive Summary Second Quarter 2017 Economic and Business Environment on page 3 . Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses decreased $250 million to $726 million , and $412 million to $1.6 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same periods in 2016 . The provision for credit losses was $182 million and $281 million lower than net charge-offs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 , resulting in a reduction in the allowance for credit losses. This compared to a reduction of $9 million and $80 million in the allowance for credit losses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 . The provision for credit losses for the consumer portfolio decreased $127 million to $606 million , and increased $243 million to $1.4 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same periods in 2016 . The decrease for the three-month period was primarily driven by improvement in the home equity and residential mortgage portfolios due to increased home prices and lower nonperforming loans. The increase for the six-month period was primarily due to portfolio seasoning and loan growth in the U.S. credit card portfolio. Included in the provision is a benefit of $24 million and an expense of $44 million related to the PCI loan portfolio for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to a benefit of $12 million and $89 million for the same periods in 2016 . The provision for credit losses for the commercial portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, decreased $123 million to $120 million , and $655 million to $183 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same periods in 2016 driven by reductions in energy exposures. Allowance for Credit Losses Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses The allowance for loan and lease losses is comprised of two components. The first component covers nonperforming commercial loans and TDRs. The second component covers loans and leases on which there are incurred losses that are not yet individually identifiable, as well as incurred losses that may not be represented in the loss forecast models. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses based on the total of these two components. The allowance for loan and lease losses excludes LHFS and loans accounted for under the fair value option as the fair value reflects a credit risk component. For more information on the allowance for loan and lease losses, see Allowance for Credit Losses in the MD&A of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K . During the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 , the factors that impacted the allowance for loan and lease losses included improvements in the credit quality of the consumer real estate portfolios driven by continuing improvements in the U.S. economy and labor markets, proactive credit risk management initiatives and the impact of high credit quality originations. Evidencing the improvements in the U.S. economy and labor markets are downward unemployment trends and increases in home prices. In addition to these improvements, in the consumer portfolio, nonperforming consumer loans decreased $722 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017 as returns to performing status, charge-offs, paydowns and loan sales continued to outpace new nonaccrual loans. During the six months ended June 30, 2017 , the allowance for loan and lease losses in the commercial portfolio reflected decreased energy reserves primarily driven by reductions in energy exposures. The allowance for loan and lease losses for the consumer portfolio, as presented in Table 49 , was $5.7 billion at June 30, 2017 , a decrease of $527 million from December 31, 2016 . The decrease was primarily in the home equity portfolio and the non-U.S. card portfolio which was sold on June 1, 2017, partially offset by an increase in the U.S. credit card portfolio. The reductions in the home equity portfolio were due to improved home prices, lower nonperforming loans and a decrease in loan balances. The increase in the U.S. credit card portfolio was driven by portfolio seasoning and loan growth. The allowance for loan and lease losses for the commercial portfolio, as presented in Table 49 , was $5.2 billion at June 30, 2017 , a decrease of $78 million from December 31, 2016 driven by decreased energy reserves due to reductions in the higher risk energy sub-sectors. Commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure decreased to $15.6 billion at June 30, 2017 from $16.3 billion (to 3.13 percent from 3.35 percent of total commercial utilized reservable exposure) at December 31, 2016 , largely due to net upgrades and paydowns in the energy portfolio. Nonperforming commercial loans decreased to $1.5 billion at June 30, 2017 from $1.7 billion (to 0.33 percent from 0.38 percent of outstanding commercial loans excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option) at December 31, 2016 . See Tables 35 , 36 and 38 for additional details on key commercial credit statistics. The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding was 1.20 percent at June 30, 2017 compared to 1.26 percent at December 31, 2016 . The June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 ratios above include the PCI loan portfolio. Excluding the PCI loan portfolio, the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding was 1.17 percent and 1.24 percent at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 . Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we also estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments such as letters of credit, financial guarantees, unfunded bankers acceptances and binding loan commitments, excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value option.

Market Risk Management For more information on our market risk management process, see Market Risk Management in the MD&A of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Trading Risk Management To evaluate risk arising from trading activities, the Corporation focuses on the actual and potential volatility of revenues generated by individual positions as well as portfolios of positions. VaR is a common statistic used to measure market risk as it allows the aggregation of market risk factors, including the effects of portfolio diversification. A VaR model simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR represents the loss a portfolio is not expected to exceed more than a certain number of times per period, based on a specified holding period, confidence level and window of historical data. We use one VaR model consistently across the trading portfolios and it uses a historical simulation approach based on a three-year window of historical data. Our primary VaR statistic is equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level. This means that for a VaR with a one-day holding period, there should not be losses in excess of VaR, on average, 99 out of 100 trading days. For more information on our trading risk management process, see Trading Risk Management in the MD&A of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Table 50 presents the total market-based trading portfolio VaR which is the combination of the covered positions trading portfolio and the impact from less liquid trading exposures. Covered positions are defined by regulatory standards as trading assets and liabilities, both on- and off-balance sheet, that meet a defined set of specifications. These specifications identify the most liquid trading positions which are intended to be held for a short-term horizon and where we are able to hedge the material risk elements in a two-way market. Positions in less liquid markets, or where there are restrictions on the ability to trade the positions, typically do not qualify as covered positions. Foreign exchange and commodity positions are always considered covered positions, except for structural foreign currency positions that are excluded with prior regulatory approval. In addition, Table 50 presents our fair value option portfolio, which includes substantially all of the funded and unfunded exposures for which we elect the fair value option, and their corresponding hedges. The fair value option portfolio combined with the total market-based trading portfolio VaR represents our total market-based portfolio VaR. Additionally, market risk VaR for trading activities as presented in Table 50 differs from VaR used for regulatory capital calculations due to the holding period being used. The holding period for VaR used for regulatory capital calculations is 10 days, while for the market risk VaR presented below it is one day. Both measures utilize the same process and methodology. The total market-based portfolio VaR results in Table 50 include market risk to which we are exposed from all business segments, excluding CVA and DVA. The majority of this portfolio is within the Global Markets segment. Table 50 presents period-end, average, high and low daily trading VaR for the three months ended June 30, 2017 , March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2016 , as well as average daily trading VaR for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 , using a 99 percent confidence level.

Therefore the impact from less liquid exposures and the amount of portfolio diversification, which is the difference between the total portfolio and the sum of the individual components, are not relevant. The average total market-based trading portfolio VaR decreased slightly for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to reduced exposure to the credit markets. The graph below presents the daily total market-based trading portfolio VaR for the previous five quarters, corresponding to the data in Table 50 . Additional VaR statistics produced within our single VaR model are provided in Table 51 at the same level of detail as in Table 50 . Evaluating VaR with additional statistics allows for an increased understanding of the risks in the portfolio as the historical market data used in the VaR calculation does not necessarily follow a predefined statistical distribution. Table 51 presents average trading VaR statistics at 99 percent and 95 percent confidence levels for the three months ended June 30, 2017 , March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2016 . 61 Bank of America Table 51 Average Market Risk VaR for Trading Activities 99 percent and 95 percent VaR Statistics Three Months Ended June 30, 2017 March 31, 2017 June 30, 2016 (Dollars in millions) 99 percent 95 percent 99 percent 95 percent 99 percent 95 percent Foreign exchange $ 13 $ 7 $ 12 $ 8 $ 9 $ 5 Interest rate 23 16 17 11 20 12 Credit 25 15 26 14 31 19 Equity 18 9 19 10 20 13 Commodity 6 4 4 3 6 3 Portfolio diversification (47 ) (30 ) (45 ) (28 ) (46 ) (31 ) Total covered positions trading portfolio 38 21 33 18 40 21 Impact from less liquid exposures 5 2 5 3 6 3 Total market-based trading portfolio 43 23 38 21 46 24 Fair value option loans 10 6 12 7 25 14 Fair value option hedges 5 4 6 4 12 8 Fair value option portfolio diversification (6 ) (5 ) (8 ) (5 ) (23 ) (14 ) Total fair value option portfolio 9 5 10 6 14 8 Portfolio diversification (4 ) (3 ) (4 ) (4 ) (6 ) (5 ) Total market-based portfolio $ 48 $ 25 $ 44 $ 23 $ 54 $ 27 Backtesting The accuracy of the VaR methodology is evaluated by backtesting, which compares the daily VaR results, utilizing a one-day holding period, against a comparable subset of trading revenue. A backtesting excess occurs when a trading loss exceeds the VaR for the corresponding day. These excesses are evaluated to understand the positions and market moves that produced the trading loss and to ensure that the VaR methodology accurately represents those losses. For more information on our backtesting process, see Trading Risk Management Backtesting in the MD&A of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K . During the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 , there were no days in which there was a backtesting excess for our total market-based portfolio VaR, utilizing a one-day holding period. Total Trading-related Revenue Total trading-related revenue, excluding brokerage fees, and CVA, DVA and funding valuation adjustment (FVA) gains (losses), represents the total amount earned from trading positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. Trading account assets and liabilities are reported at fair value. For more information on fair value, see Note 14 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Trading-related revenue can be volatile and is largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand. Also, trading-related revenue is dependent on the volume and type of transactions, the level of risk assumed, and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the ever-changing market environment. Significant daily revenue by business is monitored and the primary drivers of these are reviewed. The following histogram is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017 . During the three months ended June 30, 2017 , positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 100 percent of the trading days, of which 80 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million. This compares to the three months ended March 31, 2017 , where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for all of the trading days, of which 89 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million. Bank of America 62 Trading Portfolio Stress Testing Because the very nature of a VaR model suggests results can exceed our estimates and it is dependent on a limited historical window, we also stress test our portfolio using scenario analysis. This analysis estimates the change in the value of our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements. For additional information, see Trading Risk Management Trading Portfolio Stress Testing in the MD&A of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book The following discussion presents net interest income for banking book activities. Interest rate risk represents the most significant market risk exposure to our banking book balance sheet. Interest rate risk is measured as the potential change in net interest income caused by movements in market interest rates. Client-facing activities, primarily lending and deposit-taking, create interest rate sensitive positions on our balance sheet. We prepare forward-looking forecasts of net interest income. The baseline forecast takes into consideration expected future business growth, ALM positioning and the direction of interest rate movements as implied by the market-based forward curve. We then measure and evaluate the impact that alternative interest rate scenarios have on the baseline forecast in order to assess interest rate sensitivity under varied conditions. The net interest income forecast is frequently updated for changing assumptions and differing outlooks based on economic trends, market conditions and business strategies. Thus, we continually monitor our balance sheet position in order to maintain an acceptable level of exposure to interest rate changes. The interest rate scenarios that we analyze incorporate balance sheet assumptions such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, changes in funding mix, product repricing, maturity characteristics and investment securities premium amortization. Our overall goal is to manage interest rate risk so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital. Table 52 presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 . Table 52 Forward Rates June 30, 2017 Federal Funds Three-month LIBOR 10-Year Swap Spot rates 1.25 % 1.30 % 2.28 % 12-month forward rates 1.50 1.62 2.41 December 31, 2016 Spot rates 0.75 % 1.00 % 2.34 % 12-month forward rates 1.25 1.51 2.49 Table 53 shows the pre-tax dollar impact to forecasted net interest income over the next 12 months from June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , resulting from instantaneous parallel and non-parallel shocks to the market-based forward curve. Periodically we evaluate the scenarios presented so that they are meaningful in the context of the current rate environment. In the six months ended June 30, 2017 , the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet to rising rates was largely unchanged. We continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel move in interest rates with the majority of that benefit coming from the short end of the yield curve. Additionally, higher interest rates impact the fair value of debt securities and, accordingly, for debt securities classified as available-for-sale (AFS), may adversely affect accumulated OCI and thus capital levels under the Basel 3 capital rules. Under instantaneous upward parallel shifts, the near-term adverse impact to Basel 3 capital is reduced over time by offsetting positive 63 Bank of America impacts to net interest income. For more information on the transition provisions of Basel 3, see Capital Management Regulatory Capital on page 29 . Table 53 Estimated Banking Book Net Interest Income Sensitivity Short Rate (bps) Long Rate (bps) (Dollars in millions) June 30 2017 December 31 2016 Curve Change Parallel Shifts +100 bps instantaneous shift +100 +100 $ 3,188 $ 3,370 -50 bps instantaneous shift -50 -50 (2,684 ) (2,900 ) Flatteners Short-end instantaneous change +100 2,163 2,473 Long-end instantaneous change -50 (1,095 ) (961 ) Steepeners Short-end instantaneous change -50 (1,558 ) (1,918 ) Long-end instantaneous change +100 1,049 928 The sensitivity analysis in Table 53 assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates. As part of our ALM activities, we use securities, certain residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity. The behavior of our deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income. The sensitivity analysis in Table 53 assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher-yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce our benefit in those scenarios. Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative Contracts Interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts are utilized in our ALM activities and serve as an efficient tool to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk. We use derivatives to hedge the variability in cash flows or changes in fair value on our balance sheet due to interest rate and foreign exchange components. For more information on our hedging activities, see Note 2 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Our interest rate contracts are generally non-leveraged generic interest rate and foreign exchange basis swaps, options, futures and forwards. In addition, we use foreign exchange contracts, including cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign currency futures contracts, foreign currency forward contracts and options to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Changes to the composition of our derivatives portfolio during the six months ended June 30, 2017 reflect actions taken for interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk management. The decisions to reposition our derivatives portfolio are based on the current assessment of economic and financial conditions including the interest rate and foreign currency environments, balance sheet composition and trends, and the relative mix of our cash and derivative positions.

(2) At June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , the notional amount of same-currency basis swaps included $47.2 billion and $59.3 billion in both foreign currency and U.S. Dollar-denominated basis swaps in which both sides of the swap are in the same currency. (3) Foreign exchange basis swaps consisted of cross-currency variable interest rate swaps used separately or in conjunction with receive-fixed interest rate swaps. (4) Does not include foreign currency translation adjustments on certain non-U.S. debt issued by the Corporation that substantially offset the fair values of these derivatives. (5) The notional amount of option products of $1.8 billion at June 30, 2017 was comprised of $1.8 billion in foreign exchange options and $15 million in purchased caps/floors. Option products of $1.7 billion at December 31, 2016 were comprised of $1.7 billion in foreign exchange options and $14 million in purchased caps/floors. (6) Reflects the net of long and short positions. Amounts shown as negative reflect a net short position. (7) The notional amount of foreign exchange contracts of $18.2 billion at June 30, 2017 was comprised of $57.0 billion in foreign currency-denominated and cross-currency receive-fixed swaps, $(31.5) billion in net foreign currency forward rate contracts, $(8.4) billion in foreign currency-denominated pay-fixed swaps and $1.1 billion in net foreign currency futures contracts. Foreign exchange contracts of $(20.3) billion at December 31, 2016 were comprised of $21.5 billion in foreign currency-denominated and cross-currency receive-fixed swaps, $(38.5) billion in net foreign currency forward rate contracts, $(4.6) billion in foreign currency-denominated pay-fixed swaps and $1.3 billion in foreign currency futures contracts. 65 Bank of America We use interest rate derivative instruments to hedge the variability in the cash flows of our assets and liabilities and other forecasted transactions (collectively referred to as cash flow hedges). The net losses on both open and terminated cash flow hedge derivative instruments recorded in accumulated OCI were $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion , on a pre-tax basis, at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 . These net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the same period as the hedged cash flows affect earnings and will decrease income or increase expense on the respective hedged cash flows. Assuming no change in open cash flow derivative hedge positions and no changes in prices or interest rates beyond what is implied in forward yield curves at June 30, 2017 , the pre-tax net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings as follows: $226 million , or 18 percent within the next year, 52 percent in years two through five, and 18 percent in years six through 10, with the remaining 12 percent thereafter. For more information on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, see Note 2 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . We hedge our net investment in non-U.S. operations determined to have functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar using forward foreign exchange contracts that typically settle in less than 180 days, cross-currency basis swaps and foreign exchange options. We recorded net after-tax losses on derivatives in accumulated OCI associated with net investment hedges which were offset by gains on our net investments in consolidated non-U.S. entities at June 30, 2017 . Mortgage Banking Risk Management We originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. We determine whether loans will be held-for-investment or held-for-sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate. Interest rate risk and market risk can be substantial in the mortgage business. Changes in interest rates and other market factors impact the volume of mortgage originations. Changes in interest rates also impact the value of IRLCs and the related residential first mortgage LHFS between the date of the IRLC and the date the loans are sold to the secondary market. An increase in mortgage interest rates typically leads to a decrease in the value of these instruments. Conversely, the value of the MSRs will increase driven by lower prepayment expectations when there is an increase in interest rates. Because the interest rate risks of these two hedged items offset, we combine them into one overall hedged item with one combined economic hedge portfolio consisting of derivative contracts and securities. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 , we recorded gains in mortgage banking income of $41 million and $66 million related to the change in fair value of the MSRs, IRLCs and LHFS, net of gains and losses on the hedge portfolio, compared to gains of $51 million and $182 million for the same periods in 2016. For more information on MSRs, see Note 14 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements and for more information on mortgage banking income, see Consumer Banking on page 14 . Complex Accounting Estimates Our significant accounting principles are essential in understanding the MD&A. Many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments. For additional information, see Complex Accounting Estimates of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Goodwill and Intangible Assets The nature of and accounting for goodwill and intangible assets are discussed in the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 8 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets and Complex Accounting Estimates of the MD&A. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of June 30, 2017 for all of our reporting units that had goodwill. In performing that test, we compared the fair value of each reporting unit to its estimated carrying value as measured by allocated equity, which includes goodwill. To determine fair value, we utilized a combination of valuation techniques, consistent with the market approach and the income approach, and also utilized independent valuation specialists. Under the market approach we estimated the fair value of the individual reporting units utilizing various market multiples from comparable publicly-traded companies in industries similar to the reporting unit, including the application of a control premium of 30 percent, based upon observed comparable premiums paid for change-in-control transactions for financial institutions. Under the income approach, we estimated the fair value of the individual reporting units based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows, utilizing internal forecasts, and an appropriate terminal value. Discount rates used ranged from 8.9 to 13.3 percent and were derived from a capital asset pricing model (i.e., cost of equity financing), that we believe adequately reflects the risk and uncertainty specifically in our internally-developed forecasts, the financial markets generally and industries similar to each of the reporting units. Cumulative average growth rates developed by management for revenues and expenses in each reporting unit ranged from flat (or zero percent) to positive 5.1 percent. Based on the results of the test, we determined that the fair value exceeded the carrying value for all reporting units that had goodwill, indicating there was no impairment. A prolonged decrease in a particular assumption could eventually lead to the fair value of a reporting unit being less than its carrying value. Table 55 presents goodwill assigned to the individual reporting units and the respective fair value as a percentage of the carrying value as of June 30, 2017.
