Basis of Presentation These consolidated financial statements are unaudited; however, in the opinion of management, these statements reflect all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the periods reported. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature unless disclosed otherwise. These consolidated financial statements, including notes, have been prepared in accordance with the applicable rules of the SEC and do not include all of the information and disclosures required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The results of operations for the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. 2. Accounting Standards Accounting Standards Updates Adopted No accounting standards were adopted in the third quarter or first nine months of 2022 that had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Accounting Standards Updates Not Yet Adopted In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The guidance is effective March 12, 2020 and can be applied prospectively through December 31, 2022. Upon adoption, we do not believe it will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. 3. Income and Dividends per Common Share Basic income per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted income per share assumes exercise of stock options in all periods, provided the effect is not antidilutive. The per share calculations below exclude 1 million and 2 million of stock options for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, and 4 million of stock options for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, that were antidilutive.

Segment Information We have two reportable operating segments. Both of these segments are organized and managed based upon geographic location and the nature of the products and services offered. United States ( U.S. ) explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas in the United States International ( Int l ) produces and markets crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas outside of the United States as well as produces and markets products manufactured from natural gas, such as LNG and methanol, in Equatorial Guinea ( E.G. ) Segment income represents income that excludes certain items not allocated to our operating segments, net of income taxes. A portion of our corporate and operations general and administrative support costs are not allocated to the operating segments. These unallocated costs primarily consist of employment costs (including pension effects), professional services, facilities and other costs associated with corporate and operations support activities. Additionally, items which affect comparability such as: gains or losses on dispositions, impairments of proved and certain unproved properties, goodwill and equity method investments, changes in our valuation allowance, unrealized gains or losses on commodity and interest rate derivative instruments, effects of pension settlements and curtailments or other items (as determined by the chief operating decision maker ( CODM )) are not allocated to operating segments.

Income Taxes Effective Tax Rate The effective income tax rate is influenced by a variety of factors including the geographic and functional sources of income and the relative magnitude of these sources of income. The difference between the total provision and the sum of the amounts allocated to segments is reported in the Not Allocated to Segments column of the tables in Note 5 . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, our effective income tax rates were as follows: Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Effective income tax rate 23 % 2 % % 7 % 2022 Our effective income tax rate was different from our U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, due to the first quarter 2022 release of the valuation allowance on certain U.S. and state deferred tax assets resulting in a non-cash deferred tax benefit of $ 685 million. As we previously disclosed in our 2021 Form 10-K, we maintained a full valuation allowance on our net federal deferred tax assets and would continue to do so until there exists sufficient positive evidence to support a reversal of the allowance. In the first quarter, as a result of significant increases in commodity prices, corresponding increases in projections of our future taxable income, and the absence of objective negative evidence such as a cumulative loss in recent years, we determined we have sufficient positive evidence to release a majority of the federal valuation allowance. We retained a partial valuation allowance on certain U.S. deferred tax assets primarily as a result of volatility in commodity prices impacting assessed likelihood of future realizability. 2021 Our effective income tax rate was different from our U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, as a result of the valuation allowance on net federal deferred tax assets in the U.S. which was in place at the time. In addition, the income mix of our U.S. and E.G. operations, including the income mix within E.G. between equity method investees and subsidiaries, contributed to the difference. On August 16, 2022, the President signed the Inflation Reduction Act ( IRA ) into law. The IRA enacted various income tax provisions including a 15% corporate book minimum tax and created and extended certain tax-related energy incentives. The tax provisions of the IRA which may apply to us are generally effective in 2023 or later and therefore tax impacts to us in 2022 are expected to be immaterial. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact that the IRA may have on our U.S. income tax liability for 2023 or later years . 7. Credit Losses The majority of our receivables are from purchasers of commodities or joint interest owners in properties we operate, both of which are recorded at estimated or invoiced amounts and do not bear interest. The majority of these receivables have payment terms of 30 days or less. At the end of each reporting period, we assess the collectability of our receivables and estimate the expected credit losses using historical data, current market conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions and other data as deemed appropriate.

Inventories Crude oil and natural gas liquids are recorded at weighted average cost and carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Supplies and other items consist principally of tubular goods and equipment which are valued at weighted average cost and reviewed periodically for obsolescence or impairment when market conditions indicate. 13 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) (In millions) September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Crude oil and natural gas liquids $ 14 $ 8 Supplies and other items 89 69 Inventories $ 103 $ 77 9.

Management believes these wells exhibit sufficient quantities of hydrocarbons to justify potential development. The majority of the suspended wells require completion activities and installation of infrastructure in order to classify the reserves as proved. The decrease during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 included a $ 46 million reduction in suspended well costs as we resumed drilling or completion activities and brought previously suspended wells to sales. During the third quarter of 2022, we also recorded $ 14 million of dry well costs associated with drilled and uncompleted exploratory wells, primarily in Louisiana Austin Chalk. See Note 10 for further information. 10. Impairments The following table summarizes impairment charges of proved properties and their corresponding fair values.

During the third quarter of 2022, we recognized impairments totaling $ 48 million of unproved property leases and dry well costs in Louisiana Austin Chalk. The impairments resulted from a combination of factors including timing of lease expiration dates, our assessment of risk and resource, and the decision not to develop the acreage. We also recognized impairments of $ 14 million for unproved property leases in Permian as a result of an acreage exchange. The combined effects of these impairments were recorded as exploration expense. 2021 During the third quarter of 2021, we recognized unproved property impairments of $ 20 million for Louisiana exploration leases and $ 16 million related to the disposition of a Permian lease. In addition, we also recognized $ 12 million of dry well costs associated with drilled and uncompleted wells, primarily in Permian. The combined effects of these impairments were recorded as exploration expense. 14 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) For proved property, during the third quarter of 2021, we recorded an impairment expense of $ 5 million associated with our interests in outside operated conventional assets located in New Mexico. In the second quarter of 2021, we recorded an impairment expense of $ 24 million associated with the decommissioning of two central facilities located in Eagle Ford. During the nine months ended September 30, 2021, we recognized an incremental $ 30 million of impairment expense associated with an increase in the estimated future decommissioning costs of certain non-producing wells, pipelines and production facilities for previously divested offshore assets located in the Gulf of Mexico. See Note 11 for further information. 11. Asset Retirement Obligations Asset retirement obligations primarily consist of estimated costs to remove, dismantle and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations. Changes in asset retirement obligations were as follows: September 30, (In millions) 2022 2021 Beginning balance as of January 1 $ 316 $ 254 Incurred liabilities, including acquisitions 10 9 Settled liabilities, including dispositions ( 8 ) ( 3 ) Accretion expense (included in depreciation, depletion and amortization) 11 9 Revisions of estimates ( 1 ) 40 Ending balance as of September 30, total $ 328 $ 309 Ending balance as of September 30, short-term $ 45 $ 23 2021 In the first nine months of 2021, we had revisions of estimates totaling $ 37 million related to anticipated costs for decommissioning certain wells, pipelines and production facilities for previously divested offshore non-producing long-lived assets located in the Gulf of Mexico. As of September 30, 2021, $ 14 million of these Gulf of Mexico related revisions of estimates were classified as short-term. See Note 22 for further information. Of the $ 37 million, approximately $ 30 million was recognized as impairment expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2021. See Note 10 for further information. 12.

We primarily act as a lessee in these transactions and the majority of our existing leases are classified as either short-term or long-term operating leases. Finance Leases In 2018, we signed an agreement with an owner/lessor to construct and lease a new build-to-suit office building in Houston, Texas. The initial lease term is five years and commenced in late September 2021 after the new Houston office was ready for occupancy. In March 2022, we made our first cash lease payment. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, our cash lease payments were approximately $ 6 million. At the end of the initial lease term, we can negotiate to extend the lease term for an additional five years , subject to the approval of the participants; purchase the property subject to certain terms and conditions; or remarket the property to an unrelated third party. The lease contains a residual value guarantee of 100 % of the total acquisition and construction costs. Lessor Our wholly owned subsidiary, Marathon E.G. Production Limited, is a lessor for residential housing in E.G., which is occupied by EGHoldings, a related party equity method investee see Note 21 . The lease was classified as an operating lease and expires in 2024, with a lessee option to extend through 2034. Lease payments are fixed for the entire duration of the agreement at approximately $ 6 million per year. Our lease income is reported in other income in our consolidated statements of income for all periods presented. The undiscounted cash flows to be received under this lease agreement are summarized below.

Derivatives For further information regarding the fair value measurement of derivative instruments, see Note 14 . All of our commodity derivatives are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements under which we report net amounts. The following tables present the gross fair values of derivative instruments and the reported net amounts along with where they appear on the consolidated balance sheets.

These derivatives consist of three-way collars, two-way collars and NYMEX roll basis swaps. Three-way collars consist of a sold call (ceiling), a purchased put (floor) and a sold put. The ceiling price is the maximum we will receive for the contract volumes; the floor is the minimum price we will receive, unless the market price falls below the sold put strike price. In this case, we receive the NYMEX WTI price plus the difference between the floor and the sold put price. The following table sets forth outstanding derivative contracts as of September 30, 2022, and the weighted average prices for those contracts: 2022 2023 Fourth Quarter First Quarter Crude Oil NYMEX WTI Three-Way Collars Volume (Bbls/day) 30,000 Weighted average price per Bbl: Ceiling $ 97.52 $ Floor $ 56.67 $ Sold put $ 46.67 $ NYMEX Roll Basis Swaps Volume (Bbls/day) 60,000 Weighted average price per Bbl $ 0.67 $ Natural Gas Henry Hub ( HH ) Two-Way Collars Volume (MMBtu/day) 50,000 50,000 Weighted average price per MMBtu: Ceiling $ 19.28 $ 19.28 Floor $ 5.00 $ 5.00 Henry Hub Three-Way Collars Volume (MMBtu/day) 100,000 Weighted average price per MMBtu: Ceiling $ 7.13 $ Floor $ 3.88 $ Sold Put $ 2.88 $ 17 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) The unrealized and realized gain (loss) impact of our commodity derivative instruments appears in the table below and is reflected in net gain (loss) on commodity derivatives in the consolidated statements of income.

During the third quarter and first nine months of 2021, net cash paid for settled derivative positions was $ 108 million and $ 203 million, respectively. Interest Rate Swaps During 2020, we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $ 500 million to hedge the variations in cash flows related to fluctuations in the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) benchmark interest rate related to forecasted interest payments of a future d ebt issuance in 2022. Each respective derivative contract can be tied to an anticipated underlying dollar notional amount. During the third quarter of 2020, we de-designated these forward starting interest rate swaps previously designated as cash flow hedges. In the first quarter of 2021, the net deferred loss of $ 2 million in accumulated other comprehensive income related to these de-designated forward starting interest rate swaps was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings as an adjustment to net interest, as we fully redeemed the remainder of our outstanding 2022 notes in April 2021. We recorded a $ 5 million mark-to-market gain and a $ 24 million mark-to-market gain within net interest to reflect the change in value of these interest rate swaps during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively. During 2020, we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $ 350 million to hedge variations in cash flows arising from fluctuations in the LIBOR benchmark interest rate related to forecasted interest payments of a future debt issuance in 2025. The expected proceeds of the future debt issuance were intended to refinance the $ 900 million 3.85 % Senior Notes due 2025 ( 2025 Notes ). In September 2021, we fully redeemed these 2025 Notes. We recorded a $ 3 million mark-to-market gain and a $ 34 million mark-to-market gain within net interest to reflect the change in value of these interest rate swaps during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. In March 2022, we closed these positions and settled the interest rate swaps for proceeds of $ 44 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we recorded a cumulative $ 17 million gain within net interest for these swaps. During the second quarter of 2021, we de-designated $ 25 million of the $ 320 million Houston office cash flow hedges (discussed further in the Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow Hedges section below), as the construction cost budget estimate was reduced. These interest rate swap contracts began to settle in January 2022. On June 10, 2022, we closed the $ 25 million de-designated hedges, which resulted in cash proceeds of approximately $ 2 million. As of September 30, 2022, the remaining open interest rate swaps for the Houston office (with a notional amount of $ 295 million) are still classified as cash flow hedges. The following table presents, by maturity date, information about our de-designated forward starting interest rate swap agreements. These positions were fully liquidated as of September 30, 2022.

During the second quarter of 2021, we de-designated $ 25 million of these hedges as the construction cost budget estimate associated with the project was reduced (see discussion in preceding section). The notional amount of open interest rate swaps for the Houston office is $ 295 million. 18 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) The Houston office lease commenced in September 2021, however our first cash lease payment for February 2022 rent was paid in March. The first settlement date for the interest rate swaps was in January 2022. The last swap will mature in September 2026. During the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, net cash received/paid for the settled interest rate swap positions was immaterial. As of September 30, 2022, we expect to reclassify $ 8 million from accumulated other comprehensive income into the income statement over the next twelve months. See Note 12 for further details regarding the lease of the Houston office.

See Note 13 . Commodity derivatives include three-way collars, two-way collars and NYMEX roll basis swaps. These instruments are measured at fair value using either a Black-Scholes or a modified Black-Scholes Model. For commodity swaps, inputs to the models include only commodity prices and interest rates and are categorized as Level 1 because all assumptions and inputs are observable in active markets throughout the term of the instruments. For three-way collars and two-way collars, inputs to the models include commodity prices and implied volatility and are categorized as Level 2 because predominantly all assumptions and inputs are observable in active markets throughout the term of the instruments. The forward starting interest rate swaps are measured at fair value with a market approach using actionable broker quotes, which are Level 2 inputs. See Note 13 for detail on the forward starting interest rate swaps. 19 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Fair Values Nonrecurring See Note 10 for detail on our fair values related to impairments. Fair Values Financial Instruments Our current assets and liabilities include financial instruments, the most significant of which are receivables, the current portion of our long-term debt and payables. We believe the carrying values of our receivables and payables approximate fair value. Our fair value assessment incorporates a variety of considerations, including (1) the short-term duration of the instruments, (2) our credit rating and (3) our historical incurrence of and expected future insignificant bad debt expense, which includes an evaluation of counterparty credit risk. The following table summarizes financial instruments, excluding receivables, payables and derivative financial instruments, and their reported fair values by individual balance sheet line item at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 (In millions) Fair Value Carrying Amount Fair Value Carrying Amount Financial assets Current assets $ $ $ 11 $ 10 Other noncurrent assets 10 28 12 27 Total financial assets $ 10 $ 28 $ 23 $ 37 Financial liabilities Current liabilities $ 107 $ 171 $ 99 $ 136 Long-term debt, including current portion (a) 3,793 3,997 4,705 4,033 Deferred credits and other liabilities 16 15 46 46 Total financial liabilities $ 3,916 $ 4,183 $ 4,850 $ 4,215 (a) Excludes debt issuance costs. Fair values of our financial assets included in other noncurrent assets, and of our financial liabilities included in other current liabilities and deferred credits and other liabilities, are measured using an income approach and most inputs are internally generated, which results in a Level 3 classification. Estimated future cash flows are discounted using a rate deemed appropriate to obtain the fair value. All of our long-term debt instruments are publicly traded. A market approach, based upon quotes from major financial institutions, which are Level 2 inputs, is used to measure the fair value of our debt. 15. Debt Revolving Credit Facility As of September 30, 2022, we had no borrowings against our $ 2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility ( Credit Facility ). On July 28, 2022, we executed the seventh amendment to our Credit Facility. The primary changes to the Credit Facility effected by this amendment were to (i) extend the maturity date of the Credit Facility by three years to July 28, 2027, (ii) decrease the size of the Credit Facility from $ 3.1 billion to $ 2.5 billion, (iii) replace the LIBOR interest rate benchmark with the secured overnight financing rate ( SOFR ) and (iv) implement certain revisions to the Pricing Schedule. The Credit Facility includes a covenant requiring our total debt to total capitalization ratio not to exceed 65 % as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. In the event of a default, the lenders holding more than half of the commitments may terminate the commitments under the Credit Facility and require the immediate repayment of all outstanding borrowings and the cash collateralization of all outstanding letters of credit under the Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2022, we were in compliance with this covenant with a ratio of 20 %. Debt Redemption In May 2022, we redeemed the $ 32 million 9.375 % Senior Notes on the maturity date. 20 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) In September 2021, we redeemed our outstanding $ 900 million 3.85 % Senior Notes due 2025 ( 2025 Notes ). We incurred $ 102 million in costs related to the make-whole provision premium and the write off of unamortized discount and issuance costs. In April 2021, we redeemed our outstanding $ 500 million 2.8 % Senior Notes due 2022 ( 2022 Notes ). We incurred $ 19 million in costs related to a make-whole provision premium and the write off of unamortized discount and issuance costs. Long-term debt At September 30, 2022, we had $ 4.0 billion of total long-term debt outstanding, which includes $ 402 million of long-term debt due within one year. Included in long-term debt due within one year is $ 200 million in 2.0 % Bonds which feature a mandatory put on April 1, 2023. Refer to our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a listing of our long-term debt maturities. 16. Stockholders Equity During the first nine months of 2022, we repurchased approximately $ 2.5 billion of shares of our common stock pursuant to the share repurchase program. The total remaining share repurchase authorization was approximately $ 926 million at September 30, 2022. Purchases under the program are made at our discretion and may be in either open market transactions, including block purchases, or in privately negotiated transactions using cash on hand, cash generated from operations or proceeds from potential asset sales. This program may be changed based upon our financial condition or changes in market conditions and is subject to termination prior to completion. Additionally, during the first nine months of 2022 we repurchased $ 21 million of shares related to our tax withholding obligation associated with the vesting of employee restricted stock awards and restricted stock units; these repurchases do not impact our share repurchase program authorization. Subsequent to the quarter, we repurchased approximately $ 230 million of shares of our common stock through November 2, 2022. Effective November 2, 2022, our Board of Directors increased our remaining share repurchase program authorization to $ 2.5 billion. 17.

Payables to related parties at September 30, 2022 were $ 6 million, with the majority related to EGHoldings and $ 20 million at December 31, 2021, with the majority related to Alba Plant LLC. 24 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 22. Commitments and Contingencies Various groups, including the State of North Dakota and three Indian tribes (the Three Affiliated Tribes ) represented by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, have been involved in a dispute regarding the ownership of certain lands underlying the Missouri River and Little Missouri River (the Disputed Land ) from which we currently produce. As a result, as of September 30, 2022, we have a $ 153 million current liability in suspended royalty and working interest revenue, including interest, of which $ 138 million was included within accounts payable and $ 15 million related to accrued interest and was included within other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, we have a long-term receivable of $ 26 million for capital and expenses. The United States Department of the Interior ( DOI ) has addressed the United States position with respect to this dispute several times over the past five years with conflicting opinions. In January 2017, the DOI issued an opinion that the Disputed Land is held in trust for the Three Affiliated Tribes, then in June 2018 and May 2020 the DOI issued opinions concluding that the State of North Dakota held title to the Disputed Land. Most recently, on February 4, 2022, the DOI issued an opinion ( M-Opinion ) concluding the DOI position that the Disputed Land is held in trust for the Three Affiliated Tribes. While the M-Opinion is binding on all agencies within the DOI, it is not legally binding on third parties, including Marathon Oil, or a court. Depending on the ultimate outcome of this title dispute, the Three Affiliated Tribes could challenge the validity of certain of our leases relating to a portion of the disputed land, and if such challenge were successful it could result in operational delays and additional costs to us. Given the uncertainty in matters such as these, we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of this matter at this time; however, we believe the resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are a defendant in a number of legal and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business including, but not limited to, royalty claims, contract claims, tax disputes and environmental claims. While the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, we may also be subject to retained liabilities with respect to certain divested assets by operation of law. For example, we are exposed to the risk that owners and/or operators of assets purchased from us become unable to satisfy plugging or abandonment obligations that attach to those assets. In that event, due to operation of law, we may be required to assume plugging or abandonment obligations for those assets. Although we have established reserves for such liabilities, we could be required to accrue additional amounts in the future and these amounts could be material. Marathon Oil has been named in various lawsuits alleging royalty underpayments in our domestic operations. We intend to vigorously defend ourselves against such claims. For instance, Marathon Oil was named in a lawsuit alleging improper royalty deductions in certain of our Oklahoma operations, and after plaintiffs lost their attempt to certify a class action, a settlement in principle was reached, subject to court approval. We have accrued for potential liabilities associated with these lawsuits based on currently available information; however, actual losses may exceed our accruals or we could be required to accrue additional amounts in the future. In January 2020, we received a Notice of Violation ( NOV ) from the EPA related to allegations of violations of the Clean Air Act relating to our operations on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation between 2015 and 2019. We are actively negotiating a draft consent decree with the EPA and Department of Justice containing certain proposed injunctive terms relating to this enforcement action. The enforcement action will likely include monetary sanctions and implementation of both environmental mitigation projects and injunctive terms, which would increase both our development costs and operating costs. We maintain an accrual for estimated future costs related to this matter regarding actions required to retrofit or replace existing equipment, which we expect to incur over multiple years. Our accrual does not include possible monetary sanctions or costs associated with mitigation projects as we are unable to estimate those amounts. Through the date of this filing, there exists substantial uncertainty as to the ultimate result of this matter and it is reasonably possible the result could be materially different from our accrual. In July 2022, the Company received an NOV from the EPA relating to alleged Clean Air Act violations following flyovers conducted in 2020 over certain of the Company oil and gas facilities in New Mexico. The notice involves alleged emission and permitting violations. The Company has initiated discussions with the EPA to resolve these matters. As we are still investigating these allegations, we are unable to estimate the potential loss associated with this matter, however, it is reasonably possible that the resolution may result in a fine or penalty in excess of $ 300,000 . 25 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) We have incurred and will continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately offset by the prices we receive for our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes. These laws generally provide for control of pollutants released into the environment and require responsible parties to undertake remediation of hazardous waste disposal sites. Penalties may be imposed for noncompliance. At September 30, 2022, accrued liabilities for remediation relating to environmental laws and regulations were not material. It is not presently possible to estimate the ultimate amount of all remediation cost that might be incurred or the penalties that may be imposed. In the second quarter of 2019, Marathon E.G. Production Limited ( MEGPL ), a consolidated and wholly owned subsidiary, signed a series of agreements to process third-party Alen Unit gas through existing infrastructure located in Punta Europa, E.G. Our equity method investee, Alba Plant LLC, is also a party to some of the agreements. These agreements require (subject to certain limitations) MEGPL to indemnify the owners of the Alen Unit against injury to Alba Plant LLC personnel and damage to or loss of Alba Plant LLC automobiles, as well as third party claims caused by Alba Plant LLC and certain environmental liabilities arising from certain hydrocarbons in the custody of Alba Plant LLC. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate this obligation as we do not have any history of prior indemnification claims or environmental discharge or contamination. Therefore, we have not recorded a liability with respect to these indemnities since the amount of potential future payments under these indemnification clauses is not determinable. The agreements to process the third-party Alen Unit gas required the execution of third-party guarantees by Marathon Oil Corporation in favor of the Alen Unit owners. Two separate guarantees were executed during the second quarter of 2020; one for a maximum of approximately $ 91 million pertaining to the payment obligations of Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A. and another for a maximum of $ 25 million pertaining to the payment obligations of Alba Plant LLC. Payment by us would be required if any of those entities fails to honor its payment obligations pursuant to the relevant agreements with the owners of the Alen Unit. Certain owners of the Alen Unit, or their affiliates, are also direct or indirect shareholders in Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A. and Alba Plant LLC. Each guarantee expires no later than December 31, 2027. We measured these guarantees at fair value using the net present value of premium payments we expect to receive from our investees. Our liability for these guarantees was approximately $ 4 million as of September 30, 2022. Each of Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A. and Equatorial Guinea LNG Train 1, S.A. provided us with a pledge of its receivables as recourse against any payments we may make under the guaranty of Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A. performance. 26 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 23. Subsequent Event On November 2, 2022, we executed a definitive purchase agreement to acquire the assets and certain related liabilities of Ensign Natural Resources in the Eagle Ford resource play in Texas for total cash consideration of $ 3.0 billion. The assets primarily consist of approximately 130,000 net proved and unproved acres, with an average 97 % working interest, approximately 700 existing wells, and estimated current production of approximately 67,000 net boepd (including 22,000 net bopd of oil). We expect to fund the acquisition using a combination of cash on hand, borrowings on the company Credit Facility, and new prepayable debt. The transaction is subject to customary terms and conditions, including closing adjustments, and is expected to close by year-end 2022. 27 Item 2. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Overview Outlook Operations Market Conditions Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted Cash Flows Liquidity and Capital Resources Environmental Matters and Other Contingencies The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the preceding consolidated financial statements and notes in Item 1 . Executive Overview We are an independent exploration and production company, focused on U.S. resource plays: Eagle Ford in Texas, Bakken in North Dakota, STACK and SCOOP in Oklahoma and Northern Delaware in New Mexico. Our U.S. assets are complemented by our international operations in E.G. Our overall business strategy is to responsibly deliver competitive corporate return levels, free cash flow and cash returns to shareholders, all of which are sustainable and resilient through long-term commodity price cycles. We expect to achieve our business strategy by adherence to a disciplined reinvestment rate capital allocation framework that limits our capital expenditures relative to our expected cash flow from operations. Keeping our workforce safe, maintaining a strong balance sheet, responsibly meeting global energy demand with a focus on continuously improving environmental performance, serving as a trusted partner in our local communities and maintaining best in-class corporate governance standards are foundational to the execution of our strategy. As discussed in Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements, on November 2, 2022, we entered into an agreement to acquire approximately 130,000 net proved and unproved acres, with an average 97% working interest, in the Eagle Ford resource play in Texas. The transaction is subject to customary terms and conditions, including closing adjustments, and is expected to close by year-end 2022. Compared to the prior year, we experienced a significant increase in revenues, income from operations and operating cash flow, all of which were driven by higher commodity prices. Total company net sales volumes were slightly higher for the quarter and roughly flat for the year-to-date period. Our year-to-date cash generated from operations more than funded our capital program, dividend payments and share repurchases. These results and activities are consistent with our prioritization of free cash flow generation and adherence to our disciplined capital allocation framework. Below are certain key financial and operational highlights for the quarter: Improved financial results Our net income was $817 million in the third quarter of 2022 as compared to net income of $184 million in the same period last year. Included in our financial results for the current quarter: Revenues from contracts with customers increased $570 million compared to the same quarter last year as realized commodity prices were significantly higher. Income from equity method investments totaled $190 million, which is an increase of $104 million due to higher realized prices. We recorded a net gain of $41 million on commodity derivatives as compared to a net loss of $79 million during the same quarter last year, which increased income by $120 million. As a result of higher income before taxes, our provision for income taxes increased by $236 million compared to the same quarter last year. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the increase in income taxes. 28 Increased return of capital to investors, maintained investment grade balance sheet In the first nine months of 2022, we repurchased approximately $2.5 billion of shares through our share repurchase program, of which $1.1 billion occurred during the current quarter. As of September 30, 2022, we have $1.1 billion of cash on hand and $3.6 billion of total liquidity. Paid $162 million of dividends, or $0.23 per share, during the first nine months of 2022, compared to dividends paid of $0.12 per share during the first nine months of 2021. All three primary credit rating agencies continue to rate us as investment grade. Outlook Capital Budget In our 2021 Form 10-K filed in February 2022, we disclosed a 2022 capital budget of $1.2 billion based on assumed hydrocarbon prices of $80/bbl for WTI and $4/mmbtu for Henry Hub gas, which were indicative of market conditions at that time. Given persistent inflationary pressures and our efforts to protect execution and operational momentum into 2023, we now expect our capital budget to increase to $1.4 billion.

Following the initial COVID outbreak in 2020, commodity prices steadily increased due to rising oil demand as global economic activity recovered. However, more recently in 2022, commodity prices have experienced significant volatility due to geopolitical events, including Russia invasion of Ukraine, and demand impacts tied to macroeconomic conditions from global inflation. Price volatility was also exacerbated by ongoing OPEC+ petroleum supply limitations, COVID related impacts, strategic petroleum reserve releases and economic sanctions involving producer countries. We continue to expect commodity price volatility given the complex global dynamics of supply and demand that exist in the market. Ref e r to Ite m 1A. Risk Factors in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion on how volatility in commodity prices could impact us. 30 United States The following table presents our average price realizations and the related benchmarks for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas for the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 and 2021.

MEGPL and Marathon E.G. International Limited generally sell their share of condensate in relation to the Brent crude benchmark. Alba Plant LLC processes the rich hydrocarbon gas which is supplied by the Alba field under a fixed-price long-term contract. Alba Plant LLC extracts NGLs and secondary condensate which is then sold by Alba Plant LLC at market prices, with our share of the revenue reflected in income from equity method investments on the consolidated statements of income. Alba Plant LLC delivers the processed dry natural gas to the Alba Unit Parties for distribution and sale to AMPCO and EG LNG. Natural gas liquids Wet gas is sold to Alba Plant LLC at a fixed-price long-term contract resulting in realized prices not tracking market price. Alba Plant LLC extracts and keeps NGLs, which are sold at market price, with our share of income from Alba Plant LLC being reflected in the income from equity method investments on the consolidated statements of income. Natural gas Dry natural gas, processed by Alba Plant LLC on behalf of the Alba Unit Parties is sold by the Alba field to EG LNG and AMPCO at fixed-price long-term contracts resulting in realized prices not tracking market price. We derive additional value from the equity investment in our downstream gas processing units EG LNG and AMPCO. EG LNG sells LNG on a market-based long-term contract and AMPCO markets methanol at market prices. Alba Plant LLC and EG LNG process third party gas under a combination of tolling and a market linked profit-sharing arrangement, the benefits of which are included in our respective share of income from equity method investees.

We record commodity derivative gains/losses as the index pricing and forward curves change each period. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Income from equity method investments increased $104 million in third quarter of 2022. Our investees benefited from higher price realizations in 2022. 32 Production expenses increased $62 million in the third quarter of 2022 versus the same period in 2021, primarily as a result of the U.S. segment higher workover activity and inflationary pressures on labor, fuel, chemicals and services. The following table provides production expense and production expense rates (expense per boe) for each segment: Three Months Ended September 30, ($ in millions; rate in $ per boe) 2022 2021 Increase (Decrease) 2022 2021 Increase (Decrease) Production Expense and Rate Expense Rate United States $ 173 $ 119 45 % $ 6.40 $ 4.59 39 % International $ 20 $ 12 67 % $ 3.55 $ 2.17 64 % Shipping, handling and other operating decreased $20 million in the third quarter of 2022 versus the same period in 2021, primarily due to lower purchases of commodity volumes for resale (used to satisfy transportation commitments) as compared to the prior period. Exploration expenses include unproved property impairments, dry well costs, geological and geophysical and other costs. The dry well costs in the third quarter of 2022 includes the write-off of drilled and uncompleted exploratory wells, primarily in Louisiana Austin Chalk. The following table summarizes the components of exploration expenses: Three Months Ended September 30, (In millions) 2022 2021 Increase (Decrease) Exploration Expenses Unproved property impairments $ 45 $ 48 (6) % Dry well costs 26 14 86 % Other 2 1 100 % Total exploration expenses $ 73 $ 63 16 % Depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased $62 million in the third quarter of 2022 primarily as a result of lower DD&A (expense per boe) rate impacted by field-level changes in reserves. In addition, the DD&A rate is impacted by capitalized costs and the sales volume mix between fields. Our segments apply the units-of-production method to the majority of assets, including capitalized asset retirement costs; therefore, volumes have an impact on DD&A expense. The following table provides DD&A expense and DD&A expense rates for each segment: Three Months Ended September 30, ($ in millions; rate in $ per boe) 2022 2021 Increase (Decrease) 2022 2021 Increase (Decrease) DD&A Expense and Rate Expense Rate United States $ 441 $ 499 (12) % $ 16.20 $ 19.29 (16) % International $ 14 $ 17 (18) % $ 2.82 $ 3.12 (10) % Taxes other than income include production, severance and ad valorem taxes, primarily in the U.S., which tend to increase or decrease in relation to revenue and sales volumes. Taxes other than income increased $49 million primarily due to higher price realizations in the U.S. segment in the third quarter of 2022. Loss on early extinguishment of debt decreased $102 million due to make-whole call provisions paid upon redemption of $900 million in senior unsecured notes in the third quarter of 2021. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail. Provision for income taxes reflects an effective income tax rate of 23% in the third quarter of 2022, as compared to an effective income tax rate of 2% in the third quarter of 2021. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion concerning the changes in the effective tax rate. 33 Segment Income Segment income represents income that excludes certain items not allocated to our operating segments, net of income taxes. A portion of our corporate and operations general and administrative support costs are not allocated to the operating segments. These unallocated costs primarily consist of employment costs (including pension effects), professional services, facilities and other costs associated with corporate and operations support activities. Additionally, items which affect comparability such as: gains or losses on dispositions, impairments of proved and certain unproved properties, goodwill and equity method investments, changes in our valuation allowance, unrealized gains or losses on commodity and interest rate derivative instruments, effects of pension settlements and curtailments or other items (as determined by the chief operating decision maker ( CODM )) are not allocated to operating segments.

The increase in income was primarily due to higher price realizations and lower realized commodity derivative losses, partially offset by higher income taxes, production taxes and production expense in the third quarter of 2022. International segment income in the third quarter of 2022 was $181 million of income versus $93 million of income for the same period in 2021, primarily due to higher prices realized by our equity method investees. Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes in the third quarter of 2022 was a loss of $87 million versus a loss of $214 million for the same period in 2021, primarily due to higher costs in the prior period for the extinguishment of debt and an increase in unrealized net gains on commodity derivatives in the third quarter of 2022.

Production expenses for the first nine months of 2022 increased by $131 million compared to the same period in 2021, primarily as a result of the U.S. segment higher workover activity and inflationary pressures on labor, fuel, chemicals and services. The following table provides production expense and production expense rates for each segment: Nine Months Ended September 30, ($ in millions; rate in $ per boe) 2022 2021 Increase (Decrease) 2022 2021 Increase (Decrease) Production Expense and Rate Expense Rate United States $ 464 $ 343 35 % $ 5.94 $ 4.49 32 % International $ 45 $ 35 29 % $ 2.76 $ 2.00 38 % Shipping, handling and other operating expenses increased $37 million in the first nine months of 2022 from the comparable 2021 period. As disclosed in our Form 10-K, ce rtain of our processing arrangements with midstream entities are percentage-of-proceeds contracts. We classify the proceeds retained by the midstream companies as shipping and handling costs. The increase in shipping and handling costs of these percentage-of-proceeds contracts coincides with the increase in realized natural gas liquids prices. In addition, we have experienced an increase in legal costs from the comparable 2021 period. Exploration expenses include unproved property impairments, dry well costs, geological and geophysical and other costs. The decrease in exploration expenses was primarily driven by lower impairment of unproved property leases, partially offset by higher dry well costs associated with the write-off of drilled and uncompleted exploratory wells, primarily in Louisiana Austin Chalk. 35 The following table summarizes the components of exploration expenses: Nine Months Ended September 30, (In millions) 2022 2021 Increase (Decrease) Exploration Expenses Unproved property impairments $ 59 $ 85 (31) % Dry well costs 26 16 63 % Geological and geophysical 1 3 (67) % Other 6 5 20 % Total exploration expenses $ 92 $ 109 (16) % Depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased $231 million in the first nine months of 2022 primarily as a result of lower DD&A (expense per boe) rate impacted by field-level changes in reserves. In addition, the DD&A rate is impacted by capitalized costs and the sales volume mix between fields. Our segments apply the units-of-production method to the majority of their assets, including capitalized asset retirement costs; therefore volumes have an impact on DD&A expense. The following table provides DD&A expense and DD&A expense rates for each segment: Nine Months Ended September 30, ($ in millions; rate in $ per boe) 2022 2021 Increase (Decrease) 2022 2021 Increase (Decrease) DD&A Expense and Rate Expense Rate United States $ 1,260 $ 1,477 (15) % $ 16.11 $ 19.33 (17) % International $ 45 $ 54 (17) % $ 2.80 $ 3.10 (10) % Impairments decreased $56 million in the first nine months of 2022. Impairments in 2021 included a $30 million impairment related to an increase in the estimated future decommissioning costs of certain non-producing wells, pipelines and production facilities for previously divested offshore assets located in the Gulf of Mexico and a $24 million impairment as we decommissioned certain Eagle Ford central facilities. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the impairments in further detail. Taxes other than income include production, severance and ad valorem taxes, primarily in the U.S., which tend to increase or decrease in relation to revenue and sales volumes. Taxes other than income increased $145 million primarily due to higher price realizations in the U.S. segment in the first nine months of 2022. Loss on early extinguishment of debt decreased $121 million due to make-whole call provisions paid upon redemption of our $500 million 2022 Notes in the second quarter of 2021 and our $900 million 2025 Notes in the third quarter of 2021. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail. Provision for income taxes for current year includes a tax benefit of $685 million arising from the partial release of a valuation allowance on certain U.S. and state deferred tax assets in first quarter of 2022. This was fully offset by the provision related to current year income earned by our operations. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion concerning the rate changes. Segment Income Segment income represents income that excludes certain items not allocated to our operating segments, net of income taxes. A portion of our corporate and operations general and administrative support costs are not allocated to the operating segments. These unallocated costs primarily consist of employment costs (including pension effects), professional services, facilities and other costs associated with corporate and operations support activities. Additionally, items which affect comparability such as: gains or losses on dispositions, impairments of proved and certain unproved properties, goodwill and equity method investments, changes in our valuation allowance, unrealized gains or losses on commodity and interest rate derivative instruments, effects of pension settlements and curtailments or other items (as determined by the chief operating decision maker ( CODM )) are not allocated to operating segments. 36 The following table reconciles segment income to net income: Nine Months Ended September 30, (In millions) 2022 2021 United States $ 2,230 $ 724 International 456 211 Segment income 2,686 935 Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes 401 (638) Net income $ 3,087 $ 297 United States segment income for the first nine months of 2022 was $2,230 million of income versus a $724 million of income for the same period in 2021. This increase was primarily due to higher price realizations and lower DD&A expenses. These favorable changes were partially offset by higher income taxes, production taxes and production expense in the first nine months of 2022. International segment income for the first nine months of 2022 was $456 million of income versus $211 million of income for the same period in 2021, primarily due to higher prices realized by our equity method investees. Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes for the first nine months of 2022 was $401 million of income versus a $638 million loss for the same period in 2021. The increase was primarily due to the first quarter 2022 release of the valuation allowance on certain U.S. and state deferred tax assets resulting in a non-cash deferred tax benefit of $685 million. In addition, compared to the same period in 2021, net unrealized losses on commodity derivatives decreased by $126 million, and current year expense not allocated to segments is lower by $121 million as a result of debt extinguishment costs recognized in the prior year. Critical Accounting Estimates Other than the item set forth below, there have been no material changes or developments in the evaluation of the accounting estimates and the underlying assumptions or methodologies pertaining to our Critical Accounting Estimates disclosed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Income Taxes We have recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured at enacted tax rates, for temporary differences between book basis and tax basis, tax credit carryforwards and operating loss carryforwards. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets to the expected realizable amount by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In assessing the need for additional or adjustments to existing valuation allowances, we consider all available positive and negative evidence. Positive evidence includes reversals of temporary differences, forecasts of future taxable income, assessment of future business assumptions and applicable tax planning strategies that are prudent and feasible. Negative evidence includes losses in recent years as well as the forecasts of future losses in the realizable period. In making our assessment regarding valuation allowances, we weight the evidence based on objectivity. We base our future taxable income estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonably likely to occur. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the estimation of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions and the assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our U.S. federal income taxes. Future operating conditions can be affected by numerous factors, including (i) future crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas prices, (ii) estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, (iii) expected timing of production, and (iv) future capital requirements. An estimate of the sensitivity to changes in assumptions resulting in future taxable income calculations is not practicable, given the numerous assumptions that can materially affect our estimates. Unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions would likely be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions. For example, the impact of sustained reduced commodity prices on future taxable income would likely be partially offset by lower capital expenditures. Based on the assumptions and judgments described above, during the first quarter of 2022, we re-evaluated the realizability of U.S. and state deferred tax assets and determined that a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets was no longer necessary. As such, we recorded a non-cash deferred tax benefit in the first quarter of 2022 for $685 million. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail. Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. 37 Cash Flows Commodity prices are the most significant factor impacting our revenues, profitability, operating cash flows, the amount of capital we invest in our business, principal debt repayments, payment of dividends and funding of share repurchases. We generated significant positive cash flow from operations during the first nine months of 2022. We continue to expect volatility in commodity prices and that could impact the amount of cash flow from operations we generate. The following table presents sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents: Nine Months Ended September 30, (In millions) 2022 2021 Sources of cash and cash equivalents Operating activities $ 4,301 $ 2,093 Disposal of assets, net of cash transferred to the buyer 8 29 Other 29 15 Total sources of cash and cash equivalents $ 4,338 $ 2,137 Uses of cash and cash equivalents Additions to property, plant and equipment $ (1,117) $ (772) Debt repayment (35) (1,400) Debt extinguishment costs (117) Shares repurchased under buyback programs (2,474) Dividends paid (162) (94) Purchases of shares for tax withholding obligations (21) (10) Other (1) Total uses of cash and cash equivalents $ (3,809) $ (2,394) Cash flows generated from operating activities in the first nine months of 2022 were significantly higher compared to the same period in 2021, primarily as a result of higher realized commodity prices. The following table shows capital expenditures by segment and reconciles to additions to property, plant and equipment as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows: Nine Months Ended September 30, (In millions) 2022 2021 United States $ 1,124 $ 770 International 1 4 Corporate 11 7 Total capital expenditures (accrued) 1,136 781 Change in capital expenditure accrual (19) (9) Total use of cash and cash equivalents for property, plant and equipment $ 1,117 $ 772 The increase in our capital expenditures for the U.S. segment in the first nine months of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 largely reflects inflationary pressures related to oil field services, labor, drilling materials and equipment, as well as differences in timing of activities in our drilling and completion program. Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources and Available Liquidity Our main sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, internally generated cash flow from operations, sales of non-core assets, capital market transactions and our revolving Credit Facility. At September 30, 2022, we had approximately $3.6 billion of liquidity consisting of $1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $2.5 billion available under our revolving Credit Facility. On July 28, 2022, we executed the seventh amendment to our Credit Facility. The primary changes to the Credit Facility effected by this amendment were to (i) extend the maturity date of the Credit Facility by three years to July 28, 2027, (ii) decrease the size of the Credit Facility from $3.1 billion to $2.5 billion, (iii) replace the LIBOR interest rate benchmark with the secured overnight financing rate ( SOFR ) and (iv) implement certain revisions to the Pricing Schedule. 38 Our working capital requirements are supported by our cash and cash equivalents and our Credit Facility. We may draw on our revolving Credit Facility to meet short-term cash requirements or issue debt or equity securities through the shelf registration statement discussed below as part of our longer-term liquidity and capital management program. Because of the alternatives available to us as discussed above, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity are adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements including our capital spending programs, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities, dividends and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies. General economic conditions, commodity prices, and financial, business and other factors including the global pandemic, could affect our operations and our ability to access the capital markets. We continue to be rated investment grade at all three primary credit rating agencies. A downgrade in our credit ratings could increase our future cost of financing or limit our ability to access capital and could result in additional credit support requirements. We do not have any triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an event of default in the case of a downgrade of our credit ratings. See Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 for a discussion of how a downgrade in our credit ratings could affect us. As discussed in Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements, on November 2, 2022, we entered into an agreement to acquire approximately 130,000 net proved and unproved acres, with an average 97% working interest, in the Eagle Ford resource play in Texas for total cash consideration of $3.0 billion. We expect to fund the acquisition using a combination of cash on hand, borrowings on the company Credit Facility, and new prepayable debt. The transaction is subject to customary terms and conditions, including closing adjustments, and is expected to close by year-end 2022. Credit Arrangements and Borrowings Our Credit Facility includes a covenant requiring that our total debt to total capitalization ratio not exceed 65% as of the last day of the fiscal quarter. Our ratio was 20% at both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. At September 30, 2022, we had no borrowings on our $2.5 billion Credit Facility and $4.0 billion of total long-term debt outstanding, of which $402 million is due within the next year. In May 2022, we redeemed the $32 million 9.375% Senior Notes on the maturity date. Our next significant long-term debt maturity is in the amount of $1.0 billion due 2027. Refer to our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a listing of our long-term debt maturities. Shelf Registration We have a universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer for purposes of SEC rules, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities. Capital Requirements Share Repurchase Program During the first nine months of 2022, we repurchased approximately $2.5 billion of shares of our common stock. The total remaining share repurchase authorization was approximately $926 million at September 30, 2022. Additionally, we repurchased $21 million of shares during the first nine months of 2022 related to our tax withholding obligations associated with the vesting of employee restricted stock awards and restricted stock units; these repurchases do not impact our share repurchase program authorization. Subsequent to the quarter, we repurchased approximately $230 million of shares of our common stock through November 2, 2022. Effective November 2, 2022, our Board of Directors increased our remaining share repurchase program authorization to $2.5 billion. Dividends On October 26, 2022, our Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.09 per share payable December 12, 2022 to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 16, 2022. Other Contractual Cash Obligations As of September 30, 2022, there are no material changes to our consolidated cash obligations to make future payments under existing contracts, as disclosed in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Refer to Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the recently announced acquisition of Eagle Ford acreage. 39 Environmental Matters and Other Contingencies We have incurred and will continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately offset by the prices we receive for our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes. These laws generally provide for control of pollutants released into the environment and require responsible parties to undertake remediation of hazardous waste disposal sites. Penalties may be imposed for noncompliance. Other than the items set forth in Part II - Item 1. Legal Proceedings , there have been no significant changes to the environmental, health and safety matters under Item 1. Business or Item 3. Legal Proceedings in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of other contingencies. 40 Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ).
