Basis of Financial Statement Preparation These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in the context of the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the Corporation's 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the opinion of the Corporation, the information furnished herein reflects all known accruals and adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the periods reported herein. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. Prior data has been reclassified in certain cases to conform to the current presentation basis. The Corporation's exploration and production activities are accounted for under the "successful efforts" method. Note 2. Russia In response to Russia military action in Ukraine, the Corporation announced in early 2022 that it planned to discontinue operations on the Sakhalin-1 project ( Sakhalin ) and develop steps to exit the venture. In light of this, an impairment assessment was conducted, and management determined that the carrying value of the asset group was not recoverable. As a result, the Corporation first-quarter 2022 earnings included after-tax charges of $ 3.4 billion largely representing the full impairment of its operations related to Sakhalin. On a before-tax basis, the charges amounted to $ 4.6 billion, substantially all of which is reflected in the line captioned Depreciation and depletion (includes impairments) on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income. Effective October 14, 2022 the Russian government unilaterally terminated the Corporation interests in Sakhalin, transferring operations to a Russian operator. The Corporation fourth-quarter 2022 results included an after-tax benefit of $ 1.1 billion largely reflecting the impact of the expropriation on the company various obligations related to Sakhalin. The Corporation's exit from the project resulted in approximately 150 million oil-equivalent barrels no longer qualifying as proved reserves at year-end 2022. 8 Note 3. Litigation and Other Contingencies Litigation A variety of claims have been made against ExxonMobil and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending lawsuits. Management has regular litigation reviews, including updates from corporate and outside counsel, to assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. The Corporation accrues an undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. The Corporation does not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote. For contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and which are significant, the Corporation discloses the nature of the contingency and, where feasible, an estimate of the possible loss. For purposes of our contingency disclosures, significant includes material matters, as well as other matters which management believes should be disclosed. ExxonMobil will continue to defend itself vigorously in these matters. Based on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances, the Corporation does not believe the ultimate outcome of any currently pending lawsuit against ExxonMobil will have a material adverse effect upon the Corporation's operations, financial condition, or financial statements taken as a whole. Other Contingencies The Corporation and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries were contingently liable at March 31, 2023, for guarantees relating to notes, loans and performance under contracts. Where guarantees for environmental remediation and other similar matters do not include a stated cap, the amounts reflect management estimate of the maximum potential exposure. Where it is not possible to make a reasonable estimation of the maximum potential amount of future payments, future performance is expected to be either immaterial or have only a remote chance of occurrence. These guarantees are not reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Corporation financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

In the first quarter and early April 2023, the Corporation entered into two long-term purchase agreements with an estimated total obligation of approximately $ 4.6 billion. As of March 31, undiscounted commitments for leases not yet commenced totaled $ 4.1 billion for operating leases and $ 2.3 billion for finance leases. The operations and earnings of the Corporation and its affiliates throughout the world have been, and may in the future be, affected from time to time in varying degree by political developments and laws and regulations, such as forced divestiture of assets; restrictions on production, imports and exports; price controls; tax increases and retroactive tax claims; expropriation of property; cancellation of contract rights; sanctions and environmental regulations. Both the likelihood of such occurrences and their overall effect upon the Corporation vary greatly from country to country and are not predictable. 9 Note 4.

Financial Instruments and Derivatives The estimated fair value of financial instruments and derivatives at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and the related hierarchy level for the fair value measurement was as follows: March 31, 2023 Fair Value (millions of dollars) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Gross Assets & Liabilities Effect of Counterparty Netting Effect of Collateral Netting Difference in Carrying Value and Fair Value Net Carrying Value Assets Derivative assets (1) 5,122 2,372 7,494 ( 5,761 ) ( 943 ) 790 Advances to/receivables from equity companies (2)(6) 2,440 5,165 7,605 614 8,219 Other long-term financial assets (3) 1,243 1,506 2,749 313 3,062 Liabilities Derivative liabilities (4) 4,233 2,720 6,953 ( 5,761 ) ( 60 ) 1,132 Long-term debt (5) 32,905 1,036 6 33,947 3,415 37,362 Long-term obligations to equity companies (6) 2,502 2,502 ( 126 ) 2,376 Other long-term financial liabilities (7) 713 713 40 753 December 31, 2022 Fair Value (millions of dollars) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Gross Assets & Liabilities Effect of Counterparty Netting Effect of Collateral Netting Difference in Carrying Value and Fair Value Net Carrying Value Assets Derivative assets (1) 4,309 3,455 7,764 ( 5,778 ) ( 969 ) 1,017 Advances to/receivables from equity companies (2)(6) 2,406 4,958 7,364 685 8,049 Other long-term financial assets (3) 1,208 1,413 2,621 346 2,967 Liabilities Derivative liabilities (4) 3,417 3,264 6,681 ( 5,778 ) ( 79 ) 824 Long-term debt (5) 33,112 1,880 6 34,998 4,173 39,171 Long-term obligations to equity companies (6) 2,467 2,467 ( 129 ) 2,338 Other long-term financial liabilities (7) 679 679 38 717 (1) Included in the Balance Sheet lines: Notes and accounts receivable - net and Other assets, including intangibles - net (2) Included in the Balance Sheet line: Investments, advances and long-term receivables (3) Included in the Balance Sheet lines: Investments, advances and long-term receivables and Other assets, including intangibles - net (4) Included in the Balance Sheet lines: Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and Other long-term obligations (5) Excluding finance lease obligations (6) Advances to/receivables from equity companies and long-term obligations to equity companies are mainly designated as hierarchy level 3 inputs. The fair value is calculated by discounting the remaining obligations by a rate consistent with the credit quality and industry of the company. (7) Included in the Balance Sheet line: Other long-term obligations. Includes contingent consideration related to a prior year acquisition where fair value is based on expected drilling activities and discount rates. At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, the Corporation had $ 884 million and $ 1,494 million of collateral under master netting arrangements not offset against the derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, primarily related to initial margin requirements. 12 The Corporation may use non-derivative financial instruments, such as its foreign currency-denominated debt, as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. Under this method, the change in the carrying value of the financial instruments due to foreign exchange fluctuations is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. As of March 31, 2023, the Corporation has designated $ 4.9 billion of its Euro-denominated long-term debt and related accrued interest as a net investment hedge of its European business. The net investment hedge is deemed to be perfectly effective. The Corporation had undrawn short-term committed lines of credit of $ 363 million and undrawn long-term committed lines of credit of $ 1,281 million as of first quarter 2023. Derivative Instruments The Corporation size, strong capital structure, geographic diversity, and the complementary nature of its business segments reduce the Corporation enterprise-wide risk from changes in commodity prices, currency rates and interest rates. In addition, the Corporation uses commodity-based contracts, including derivatives, to manage commodity price risk and to generate returns from trading. Commodity contracts held for trading purposes are presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income on a net basis in the line Sales and other operating revenue". The Corporation commodity derivatives are not accounted for under hedge accounting. At times, the Corporation also enters into currency and interest rate derivatives, none of which are material to the Corporation financial position as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, or results of operations for the periods ended March 31, 2023 and 2022. Credit risk associated with the Corporation derivative position is mitigated by several factors, including the use of derivative clearing exchanges and the quality of and financial limits placed on derivative counterparties. The Corporation maintains a system of controls that includes the authorization, reporting, and monitoring of derivative activity. The net notional long/(short) position of derivative instruments at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, was as follows: (millions) March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Crude oil (barrels) 15 4 Petroleum products (barrels) ( 48 ) ( 52 ) Natural gas (MMBTUs) ( 29 ) ( 64 ) Realized and unrealized gains/(losses) on derivative instruments that were recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income are included in the following lines on a before-tax basis: (millions of dollars) Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 Sales and other operating revenue 651 ( 2,535 ) Crude oil and product purchases ( 25 ) ( 26 ) Total 626 ( 2,561 ) 13 Note 8.

Trade receivables in Notes and accounts receivable net reported on the Balance Sheet also includes both receivables within the scope of ASC 606 and those outside the scope of ASC 606. Revenue and receivables outside the scope of ASC 606 primarily relate to physically settled commodity contracts accounted for as derivatives. Contractual terms, credit quality, and type of customer are generally similar between those revenues and receivables within the scope of ASC 606 and those outside it.

Divestment Activities In the first quarter, the Corporation completed the sale of Mobil California Exploration and Producing Asset Company, consisting of ExxonMobil's interest in the Aera Energy joint venture, to Green Gate Resources E, LLC. Cash flow related to the divestment was $ 0.6 billion in the first quarter, and the Corporation expects to receive additional consideration of $ 0.4 billion, primarily in 2023. The net book value of the assets divested was $ 1.1 billion. In January 2023, the Corporation executed an agreement with Bangchak Corporation to sell its interest in Esso Thailand Ltd. that includes the Sriracha Refinery, select distribution terminals, and a network of retail stations. The transaction is anticipated to close in third quarter 2023. In November 2022, the Corporation executed an agreement for the sale of the Santa Ynez Unit and associated assets in California. The agreement is subject to certain conditions precedent and government approvals and does not yet meet held-for-sale criteria under ASC 360. Should the conditions precedent be met and the potential transaction close, the Corporation would expect to recognize a loss of up to $ 2 billion. In February 2022, the Corporation signed an agreement with Seplat Energy Offshore Limited for the sale of Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited. The agreement is subject to certain conditions precedent and government approvals. In mid-2022, a Nigerian court issued an order to halt transition activities and enter into arbitration with the Nigerian National Petroleum Company. The closing date and any loss on sale will depend on resolution of these matters. 16 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview During the first quarter of 2023 the price of crude oil decreased as the global oil market saw higher inventory levels; however prices remained above the 10-year average (2010-2019). The increase in inventory levels was followed by an early April announcement from OPEC+ oil producers to further reduce oil output. Natural gas prices remained above the 10-year range, despite declining significantly in the quarter as milder weather eased demand for natural gas heating, allowing storage levels to increase above historical averages in the United States and Europe. While moderating slightly from the fourth quarter of 2022, refining margins remained above the 10-year range due to low inventory levels of petroleum products. While chemical margins remained below the 10-year range due to continued bottom-of-cycle conditions in Asia Pacific, margins in North America improved on lower energy and feed costs. The Corporation first quarter results include after-tax charges of $0.2 billion related to additional European taxes imposed on the energy sector, mainly reflected in the line Income tax expense (benefit). The enactment of regulations in late 2022 by European Member States and other countries imposed mandatory taxes on certain companies active in the crude petroleum, coal, natural gas, and refinery sectors. FUNCTIONAL EARNINGS SUMMARY Earnings (loss) excluding Identified Items (non-GAAP) are earnings (loss) excluding individually significant non-operational events with, typically, an absolute corporate total earnings impact of at least $250 million in a given quarter. The earnings (loss) impact of an identified item for an individual segment may be less than $250 million when the item impacts several periods or several segments. Earnings (loss) excluding Identified Items does include non-operational earnings events or impacts that are generally below the $250 million threshold utilized for Identified Items. Management uses these figures to improve comparability of the underlying business across multiple periods by isolating and removing significant non-operational events from business results. The Corporation believes this view provides investors increased transparency into business results and trends and provides investors with a view of the business as seen through the eyes of management. Earnings (loss) excluding Identified Items is not meant to be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss) attributable to ExxonMobil as prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Growth in Guyana and the Permian more than offset the impacts from divestments and the Russia expropriation. 1Q 2023 production also benefited from lower downtime and higher entitlements due to lower prices. Listed below are descriptions of ExxonMobil volumes reconciliation factors which are provided to facilitate understanding of the terms. Entitlements - Net Interest are changes to ExxonMobil share of production volumes caused by non-operational changes to volume-determining factors. These factors consist of net interest changes specified in Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) which typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity upon achieving pay-out in partner investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. Once a net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices. Entitlements - Price, Spend and Other are changes to ExxonMobil share of production volumes resulting from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. These factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one period to another. According to the terms of contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. For example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for ExxonMobil to recover its costs. These effects generally vary from period to period with field spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. Such factors can also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific provisions in production agreements. Government Mandates are changes to ExxonMobil's sustainable production levels as a result of temporary non-operational production limits or sanctions imposed by governments, generally upon a country, sector, type or method of production. Divestments are reductions in ExxonMobil production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other economic consideration. Growth and Other comprise all other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above definitions that may affect volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. Such factors include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project and work program activities, acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges, downtime, market demand, natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial terms that do not affect entitlements. 20 ENERGY PRODUCTS Energy Products Financial Results (millions of dollars) Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 Earnings (loss) (U.S. GAAP) United States 1,910 489 Non-U.S. 2,273 (684) Total 4,183 (196) Identified Items (1) United States Non-U.S. (30) Total (30) Earnings (loss) excluding Identified Items (1) (Non-GAAP) United States 1,910 489 Non-U.S. 2,303 (684) Total 4,213 (196) Due to rounding, numbers presented may not add up precisely to the totals indicated.

Corporate and Financing expenses were $355 million for the first quarter of 2023, $339 million lower than the first quarter of 2022, reflecting lower financing costs and the absence of an identified item associated with the expropriation of the Corporation's interest in Sakhalin-1. 25 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (millions of dollars) Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 Net cash provided by/(used in) Operating activities 16,341 14,788 Investing activities (4,925) (3,945) Financing activities (8,507) (6,713) Effect of exchange rate changes 102 142 Increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 3,011 4,272 Cash and cash equivalents (at end of period) 32,676 11,074 Cash flow from operations and asset sales Net cash provided by operating activities (U.S. GAAP) 16,341 14,788 Proceeds associated with sales of subsidiaries, property, plant & equipment, and sales and returns of investments 854 293 Cash flow from operations and asset sales (Non-GAAP) 17,195 15,081 Because of the ongoing nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder distributions. Cash flow from operations and asset sales in the first quarter of 2023 was $17.2 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion from the comparable 2022 period primarily reflecting higher earnings. Cash provided by operating activities totaled $16.3 billion for the first three months of 2023, $1.6 billion higher than 2022. Net income including noncontrolling interests was $11.8 billion, an increase of $6.1 billion from the prior year period. The adjustment for the noncash provision of $4.2 billion for depreciation and depletion was down $4.6 billion from 2022. Changes in operational working capital were a reduction of $0.3 billion, compared to a contribution of $1.1 billion in the prior year period. All other items net increased cash flows by $0.6 billion in 2023 versus a reduction of $0.9 billion in 2022. See the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for additional details. Investing activities for the first three months of 2023 used net cash of $4.9 billion, an increase of $1.0 billion compared to the prior year. Spending for additions to property, plant and equipment of $5.4 billion was $1.5 billion higher than 2022. Proceeds from asset sales were $0.9 billion. Net investments and advances increased $0.1 billion to $0.4 billion. Net cash used in financing activities was $8.5 billion in the first three months of 2023, including $4.3 billion for the purchase of 39.3 million shares of ExxonMobil stock, as part of the previously announced buyback program. This compares to net cash used in financing activities of $6.7 billion in the prior year. Total debt at the end of the first quarter of 2023 was $41.4 billion compared to $41.2 billion at year-end 2022. The Corporation's debt to total capital ratio was 16.7 percent at the end of the first quarter of 2023 compared to 16.9 percent at year-end 2022. The net debt to capital ratio was 4.1 percent at the end of the first quarter, a decrease of 1.3 percentage points from year-end 2022. The Corporation's capital allocation priorities are investing in competitively advantaged, high-return projects, maintaining a strong balance sheet, and sharing our success with our shareholders through more consistent share repurchases and a growing dividend. The Corporation distributed a total of $3.7 billion to shareholders in the first three months of 2023 through dividends. The Corporation has access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity. Internally generated funds are expected to cover the majority of financial requirements, supplemented by long-term and short-term debt. The Corporation had undrawn short-term committed lines of credit of $0.4 billion and undrawn long-term committed lines of credit of $1.3 billion as of first quarter 2023. The Corporation, as part of its ongoing asset management program, continues to evaluate its mix of assets for potential upgrade. Because of the ongoing nature of this program, dispositions will continue to be made from time to time which will result in either gains or losses. Additionally, the Corporation continues to evaluate opportunities to enhance its business portfolio through acquisitions of assets or companies, and enters into such transactions from time to time. Key criteria for evaluating acquisitions include strategic fit, potential for future growth and attractive current valuations. Acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the Corporation common stock, or both. Litigation, other contingencies, and contractual obligations are discussed in Note 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 26 TAXES (millions of dollars) Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 Income taxes 4,960 2,806 Effective income tax rate 34 % 40 % Total other taxes and duties (1) 8,095 8,449 Total 13,055 11,255 (1) Includes Other taxes and duties plus taxes that are included in Production and manufacturing expenses and Selli ng, general and administrative expenses . Total taxes were $13.1 billion for the first quarter of 2023, an increase of $1.8 billion from 2022. Income tax expense was $5.0 billion compared to $2.8 billion in the prior year reflecting higher commodity prices. The effective income tax rate of 34 percent declined from the 40 percent rate in the prior year period due primarily to a change in mix of results in jurisdictions with varying tax rates and one-time impacts in the prior period. Total other taxes and duties decreased by $0.4 billion to $8.1 billion.
