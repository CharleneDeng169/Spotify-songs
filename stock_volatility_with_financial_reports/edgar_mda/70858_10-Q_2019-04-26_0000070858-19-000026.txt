Bank of America 2 Executive Summary Business Overview The Corporation is a Delaware corporation, a bank holding company (BHC) and a financial holding company. When used in this report, the Corporation may refer to Bank of America Corporation individually, Bank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries, or certain of Bank of America Corporation subsidiaries or affiliates. Our principal executive offices are located in Charlotte, North Carolina. Through our banking and various nonbank subsidiaries throughout the U.S. and in international markets, we provide a diversified range of banking and nonbank financial services and products through four business segments: Consumer Banking , Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM) , Global Banking and Global Markets , with the remaining operations recorded in All Other . We operate our banking activities primarily under the Bank of America, National Association (Bank of America, N.A. or BANA) charter. At March 31, 2019 , the Corporation had $2.4 trillion in assets and a headcount of approximately 205,000 employees. As of March 31, 2019 , we served clients through operations across the U.S., its territories and approximately 35 countries. Our retail banking footprint covers approximately 86 percent of the U.S. population, and we serve approximately 66 million consumer and small business clients with approximately 4,400 retail financial centers, approximately 16,400 ATMs, and leading digital banking platforms (www.bankofamerica.com) with more than 37 million active users, including over 27 million active mobile users. We offer industry-leading support to approximately three million small business owners. Our wealth management businesses, with client balances of $2.8 trillion , provide tailored solutions to meet client needs through a full set of investment management, brokerage, banking, trust and retirement products. We are a global leader in corporate and investment banking and trading across a broad range of asset classes serving corporations, governments, institutions and individuals around the world. Recent Developments Capital Management During the first quarter of 2019 , we repurchased $6.3 billion of common stock pursuant to the Board of Directors (the Board) repurchase authorizations. For additional information, see Capital Management on page 16 . U.K. Exit from the EU A referendum held in the U.K. in 2016 resulted in a majority vote in favor of exiting the European Union (EU). In March 2017, the U.K. notified the EU of its intention to withdraw from the EU. In April 2019, the deadline for the U.K. withdrawal from the EU was extended to October 31, 2019. The U.K. withdrawal could occur sooner if the U.K. passes a withdrawal agreement prior to the deadline. Negotiations between the U.K. and the EU regarding the terms and conditions of the withdrawal are ongoing. We conduct business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa primarily through our subsidiaries in the U.K., Ireland and France. In connection with the U.K. intention to withdraw from the EU, we have implemented the following changes to how we operate in the region, including establishing a bank and broker-dealer in the EU. Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Designated Activity Company (BAMLI DAC), our main banking entity in Ireland, was established in late 2018 through the merger of two entities. BAMLI DAC provides banking services in the European Economic Area, the Middle East and Africa directly and through its branch network. Reliance on the EU cross-border merger directive enabled BAMLI DAC to migrate client positions, with decreased legal complexity and operational risk. BofA Securities Europe SA (BofASE), a newly formed investment firm in France, was set up to deliver investment services in the European Economic Area excluding the U.K. and is now operational. Merrill Lynch International (MLI) continues to be our primary investment firm in the U.K. BANA, including its London branch, continues to conduct operations in the EU and the U.K. These changes will enable us to continue to service our clients with minimal disruption, retain operational flexibility, minimize transition risks and maximize legal entity efficiencies, independent of the ultimate outcome and timing of the withdrawal. To facilitate client readiness and mitigate operational risk, BofASE and BAMLI DAC continue to execute internal and client-related testing activities across product and business lines. Migration of client activity to BofASE and BAMLI DAC began in February and March 2019, respectively. While we have taken measures to minimize operational disruption and prepare for various potential outcomes of the U.K. withdrawal from the EU, the preparedness of our counterparties and the relevant financial markets infrastructure remain outside our control. The global economic impact of the U.K. withdrawal from the EU remains uncertain and could result in regional and global financial market disruptions. In preparation for the withdrawal, we will continue to assess potential risks, including operational, regulatory and legal risks. Financial Highlights Effective January 1, 2019, we made certain financial reporting changes and reclassifications, which were adopted on a retrospective basis. The changes and reclassifications reflect changes to both the format of the Consolidated Statement of Income and segment allocations. For additional information, see the Corporation Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on April 1, 2019. 3 Bank of America Table 1 Summary Income Statement and Selected Financial Data Three Months Ended March 31 (Dollars in millions, except per share information) 2019 2018 Income statement Net interest income $ 12,375 $ 11,769 Noninterest income 10,629 11,301 Total revenue, net of interest expense 23,004 23,070 Provision for credit losses 1,013 834 Noninterest expense 13,224 13,842 Income before income taxes 8,767 8,394 Income tax expense 1,456 1,476 Net income 7,311 6,918 Preferred stock dividends 442 428 Net income applicable to common shareholders $ 6,869 $ 6,490 Per common share information Earnings $ 0.71 $ 0.63 Diluted earnings 0.70 0.62 Dividends paid 0.15 0.12 Performance ratios Return on average assets 1.26 % 1.21 % Return on average common shareholders equity 11.42 10.85 Return on average tangible common shareholders equity (1) 16.01 15.26 Efficiency ratio 57.48 60.00 March 31 2019 December 31 2018 Balance sheet Total loans and leases $ 945,615 $ 946,895 Total assets 2,377,164 2,354,507 Total deposits 1,379,337 1,381,476 Total common shareholders equity 244,684 242,999 Total shareholders equity 267,010 265,325 (1) Return on average tangible common shareholders equity is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information and a corresponding reconciliation to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) financial measures, see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 42 . Net income was $7.3 billion , or $0.70 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to $6.9 billion , or $0.62 per diluted share, for the same period in 2018 . The improvement in net income was driven by an increase in net interest income and a decline in noninterest expense, partially offset by lower noninterest income and an increase in the provision for credit losses. Total assets increased $22.7 billion from December 31, 2018 to $2.4 trillion primarily driven by higher trading account assets due to increased client balances in the Equities businesses in Global Markets and an increase in other assets as a result of the implementation of the new lease accounting standards. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in customer and other receivables due to client activity in Global Markets . Total liabilities increased $21.0 billion from December 31, 2018 to $2.1 trillion primarily driven by higher trading account liabilities due to increased client activity in Global Markets and an increase in other liabilities due to the implementation of the new lease accounting standards, partially offset by a decrease in short-term borrowings due to lower funding needs as a result of deposit growth. Shareholders equity increased $1.7 billion from December 31, 2018 primarily due to net income and market value increases on debt securities partially offset by returns of capital to shareholders through common stock repurchases and common and preferred stock dividends. Net Interest Income Net interest income increased $606 million to $12.4 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. Net interest yield on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis increased 9 basis points (bps) to 2.51 percent . These increases were primarily driven by higher interest rates as well as loan and deposit growth, modestly offset by loan spread compression. We expect full-year 2019 net interest income to increase by approximately three percent compared to full-year 2018 assuming the interest rate forward curve as of April 16, 2019 when the first quarter results were announced, and loan and deposit growth consistent with the current economic outlook. For more information on net interest yield and the FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 5 , and for more information on interest rate risk management, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 39 . Noninterest Income Table 2 Noninterest Income Three Months Ended March 31 (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 Fees and commissions: Card income $ 1,375 $ 1,402 Service charges 1,839 1,921 Investment and brokerage services 3,360 3,664 Investment banking fees 1,264 1,353 Total fees and commissions 7,838 8,340 Trading account income 2,338 2,553 Other income 453 408 Total noninterest income $ 10,629 $ 11,301 Noninterest income decreased $672 million to $10.6 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. The following highlights the significant changes. Service charges decreased $82 million primarily driven by lower treasury services-related revenue and credit fees in Global Banking, as well as lower overdraft fees due to policy changes and lower ATM volume in Consumer Banking . Investment and brokerage services income decreased $304 million primarily due to lower average market valuations compared to the same period in 2018 and declines in transactional revenue and assets under management (AUM) pricing, partially offset by the positive impact of AUM flows. The decline in transactional revenue was driven by lower market volatility resulting in lower client activity. Investment banking fees decreased $89 million primarily due to declines in debt and equity underwriting fees, partially offset by an increase in advisory fees. Trading account income decreased $215 million primarily due to lower client activity across fixed-income, currencies and commodities (FICC) and Equities. Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses increased $179 million to $1.0 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018, primarily driven by a single-name utility client charge-off in the current-year period and energy reserve releases in commercial in the prior-year period, a slower pace of portfolio improvement in consumer real estate, and portfolio seasoning in the U.S. credit card portfolio. For more information on the provision for credit losses, see Provision for Credit Losses on page 35 . Bank of America 4 Noninterest Expense Table 3 Noninterest Expense Three Months Ended March 31 (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 Compensation and benefits $ 8,249 $ 8,480 Occupancy and equipment 1,605 1,607 Information processing and communications 1,164 1,165 Product delivery and transaction related 662 756 Marketing 442 345 Professional fees 360 381 Other general operating 742 1,108 Total noninterest expense $ 13,224 $ 13,842 Noninterest expense decreased $618 million to $13.2 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to efficiency savings, lower Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) expense and lower amortization of intangibles, partially offset by increased investments in the businesses. Income Tax Expense Table 4 Income Tax Expense Three Months Ended March 31 (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 Income before income taxes $ 8,767 $ 8,394 Income tax expense 1,456 1,476 Effective tax rate 16.6 % 17.6 % The effective tax rates for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 were primarily driven by our recurring tax preference benefits and tax benefits from deductions associated with share-based compensation. We expect the effective tax rate for 2019 to be approximately 19 percent, absent unusual items. Supplemental Financial Data In this Form 10-Q, we present certain non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items or otherwise include components that differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP . Non-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional useful information to assess our financial condition, results of operations (including period-to-period operating performance) or compliance with prospective regulatory requirements. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same way as non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. We view net interest income and related ratios and analyses on an FTE basis, which when presented on a consolidated basis are non-GAAP financial measures. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 21 percent and a representative state tax rate. Net interest yield, which measures the basis points we earn over the cost of funds, utilizes net interest income (and thus total revenue) on an FTE basis. We believe that presentation of these items on an FTE basis allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practices. We may present certain key performance indicators and ratios excluding certain items (e.g., debit valuation adjustment (DVA) gains (losses)) which result in non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the presentation of measures that exclude these items is useful because such measures provide additional information to assess the underlying operational performance and trends of our businesses and to allow better comparison of period-to-period operating performance. We also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents an adjusted shareholders equity or common shareholders equity amount which has been reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)), net of related deferred tax liabilities. These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models use both return on average tangible common shareholders equity and return on average tangible shareholders equity as key measures to support our overall growth goals. These ratios are as follows: Return on average tangible common shareholders equity measures our net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average common shareholders equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders equity divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on average tangible shareholders equity measures our net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders equity divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders equity divided by ending common shares outstanding. We believe that the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. Tangible book value per common share provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation to outstanding shares of common stock. The aforementioned supplemental data and performance measures are presented in Tables 5 and 6 . For more information on the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 42 . 5 Bank of America Table 5 Selected Quarterly Financial Data 2019 Quarter 2018 Quarters (In millions, except per share information) First Fourth Third Second First Income statement Net interest income $ 12,375 $ 12,504 $ 12,061 $ 11,828 $ 11,769 Noninterest income 10,629 10,173 10,663 10,721 11,301 Total revenue, net of interest expense 23,004 22,677 22,724 22,549 23,070 Provision for credit losses 1,013 905 716 827 834 Noninterest expense 13,224 13,074 13,014 13,224 13,842 Income before income taxes 8,767 8,698 8,994 8,498 8,394 Income tax expense 1,456 1,420 1,827 1,714 1,476 Net income 7,311 7,278 7,167 6,784 6,918 Net income applicable to common shareholders 6,869 7,039 6,701 6,466 6,490 Average common shares issued and outstanding 9,725.9 9,855.8 10,031.6 10,181.7 10,322.4 Average diluted common shares issued and outstanding 9,787.3 9,996.0 10,170.8 10,309.4 10,472.7 Performance ratios Return on average assets 1.26 % 1.24 % 1.23 % 1.17 % 1.21 % Four-quarter trailing return on average assets (1) 1.22 1.21 1.00 0.93 0.86 Return on average common shareholders equity 11.42 11.57 10.99 10.75 10.85 Return on average tangible common shareholders equity (2) 16.01 16.29 15.48 15.15 15.26 Return on average shareholders equity 11.14 10.95 10.74 10.26 10.57 Return on average tangible shareholders equity (2) 15.10 14.90 14.61 13.95 14.37 Total ending equity to total ending assets 11.23 11.27 11.21 11.53 11.43 Total average equity to total average assets 11.28 11.30 11.42 11.42 11.41 Dividend payout 21.20 20.90 22.35 18.83 19.06 Per common share data Earnings $ 0.71 $ 0.71 $ 0.67 $ 0.64 $ 0.63 Diluted earnings 0.70 0.70 0.66 0.63 0.62 Dividends paid 0.15 0.15 0.15 0.12 0.12 Book value 25.57 25.13 24.33 24.07 23.74 Tangible book value (2) 18.26 17.91 17.23 17.07 16.84 Market capitalization $ 263,992 $ 238,251 $ 290,424 $ 282,259 $ 305,176 Average balance sheet Total loans and leases $ 944,020 $ 934,721 $ 930,736 $ 934,818 $ 931,915 Total assets 2,360,992 2,334,586 2,317,829 2,322,678 2,325,878 Total deposits 1,359,864 1,344,951 1,316,345 1,300,659 1,297,268 Long-term debt 196,726 201,056 203,239 199,448 197,787 Common shareholders equity 243,891 241,372 241,812 241,313 242,713 Total shareholders equity 266,217 263,698 264,653 265,181 265,480 Asset quality Allowance for credit losses (3) $ 10,379 $ 10,398 $ 10,526 $ 10,837 $ 11,042 Nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties (4) 5,145 5,244 5,449 6,181 6,694 Allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding (4) 1.02 % 1.02 % 1.05 % 1.08 % 1.11 % Allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total nonperforming loans and leases (4) 197 194 189 170 161 Net charge-offs $ 991 $ 924 $ 932 $ 996 $ 911 Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases outstanding (4) 0.43 % 0.39 % 0.40 % 0.43 % 0.40 % Capital ratios at period end (5) Common equity tier 1 capital 11.6 % 11.6 % 11.4 % 11.4 % 11.3 % Tier 1 capital 13.1 13.2 12.9 13.0 13.0 Total capital 15.2 15.1 14.7 14.8 14.8 Tier 1 leverage 8.4 8.4 8.3 8.4 8.4 Supplementary leverage ratio 6.8 6.8 6.7 6.7 6.8 Tangible equity (2) 8.5 8.6 8.5 8.7 8.7 Tangible common equity (2) 7.6 7.6 7.5 7.7 7.6 Total loss-absorbing capacity and long-term debt metrics (6) Total loss-absorbing capacity to risk-weighted assets 24.8 % Total loss-absorbing capacity to supplementary leverage exposure 12.8 Eligible long-term debt to risk-weighted assets 11.4 Eligible long-term debt to supplementary leverage exposure 5.9 (1) Calculated as total net income for four consecutive quarters divided by annualized average assets for four consecutive quarters.

We manage our segments and report their results on an FTE basis. We periodically review capital allocated to our businesses and allocate capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. We utilize a methodology that considers the effect of regulatory capital requirements in addition to internal risk-based capital models. Our internal risk-based capital models use a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment credit, market, interest rate, business and operational risk components. For more information on the nature of these risks, see Managing Risk on page 16 . The capital allocated to the business segments is referred to as allocated capital. Allocated equity in the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting unit. For more information, see Note 8 Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements . For more information on our presentation of financial information on an FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 5 , and reconciliations to consolidated total revenue, net income and period-end total assets, see Note 18 Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements .

Net interest income increased $629 million to $7.1 billion primarily due to the beneficial impact of an increase in investable assets as a result Bank of America 8 of higher interest rates, as well as an increase in deposits, pricing discipline and loan growth. Noninterest income of $2.5 billion remained relatively unchanged. The provision for credit losses increased $39 million to $974 million due to portfolio seasoning in the U.S. credit card portfolio. Noninterest expense decreased $189 million to $4.4 billion primarily driven by lower FDIC expense and operating efficiencies. These decreases were partially offset by investments in digital capabilities and business growth combined with investments in new financial centers and renovations. The return on average allocated capital was 36 percent, up from 29 percent, driven by higher net income. For additional information on capital allocations, see Business Segment Operations on page 8 . Deposits Net income for Deposits increased $587 million to $2.2 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 driven by higher revenue and lower noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $595 million to $4.3 billion primarily due to the beneficial impact of an increase in investable assets as a result of higher deposits, and pricing discipline. Noninterest income increased $78 million to $1.2 billion primarily driven by results from asset and liability management (ALM) activities, partially offset by lower service charges. The provision for credit losses increased $5 million to $46 million . Noninterest expense decreased $80 million to $2.6 billion primarily driven by lower FDIC expense and operating efficiencies. These decreases were partially offset by investments in digital capabilities and business growth combined with investments in new financial centers and renovations. Average deposits increased $23.2 billion to $692.2 billion driven by strong organic growth. Growth in checking and money market savings of $27.0 billion was partially offset by a decline in time deposits and traditional savings of $3.6 billion.

Net income for GWIM increased $127 million to $1.0 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 due to higher net interest income and lower noninterest expense, partially offset by lower noninterest income. The operating margin was 29 percent compared to 25 percent a year ago. Net interest income increased $100 million to $1.7 billion due to higher deposit spreads, and increases in average deposit and loan balances, partially offset by lower loan spreads. Noninterest income, which primarily includes investment and brokerage services income, decreased $136 million to $3.1 billion . The decrease was driven by lower average market valuations compared to the same period in 2018 and declines in transactional revenue and AUM pricing, partially offset by the positive impact of AUM flows. The decline in transactional revenue was driven by lower market volatility resulting in lower client activity. Noninterest expense decreased $154 million to $3.4 billion primarily driven by lower amortization of intangibles, revenue-related incentives and FDIC expense combined with continued expense discipline, partially offset by investments in business growth. The return on average allocated capital was 29 percent, up from 26 percent, due to higher net income. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 8 . MLGWM revenue of $4.0 billion decreased one percent reflecting lower asset management fees and transactional revenue, partially offset by higher net interest income. The decrease in asset management fees was driven by lower average market valuations and AUM pricing, partially offset by the impact of higher AUM flows. Bank of America Private Bank revenue of $855 million also decreased one percent due to lower average market valuations.

Global Transaction Services revenue increased $198 million to $2.2 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 driven by higher deposit rates and increased deposit balances. Average loans and leases increased five percent for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 driven by growth in the commercial and industrial portfolio. Average deposits increased eight percent due to growth in domestic interest-bearing balances. Global Investment Banking Client teams and product specialists underwrite and distribute debt, equity and loan products, and provide advisory services and tailored risk management solutions. The economics of certain investment banking and underwriting activities are shared primarily between Global Banking and Global Markets under an internal revenue-sharing arrangement. Global Banking originates certain deal-related transactions with our corporate and commercial clients that are executed and distributed by Global Markets . To provide a complete discussion of our consolidated investment banking fees, the following table presents total Corporation investment banking fees and the portion attributable to Global Banking. Investment Banking Fees Global Banking Total Corporation Three Months Ended March 31 (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Products Advisory $ 303 $ 276 $ 343 $ 296 Debt issuance 327 356 748 827 Equity issuance 79 112 234 314 Gross investment banking fees 709 744 1,325 1,437 Self-led deals (20 ) (34 ) (61 ) (84 ) Total investment banking fees $ 689 $ 710 $ 1,264 $ 1,353 Total Corporation investment banking fees, excluding self-led deals, of $1.3 billion , which are primarily included within Global Banking and Global Markets, decreased seven percent for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to declines in debt and equity underwriting fees, partially offset by an increase in advisory fees. 13 Bank of America Global Markets Three Months Ended March 31 (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 % Change Net interest income $ 953 $ 1,020 (7 )% Noninterest income: Investment and brokerage services 444 488 (9 ) Investment banking fees 537 609 (12 ) Trading account income 2,082 2,557 (19 ) All other income 165 138 20 Total noninterest income 3,228 3,792 (15 ) Total revenue, net of interest expense 4,181 4,812 (13 ) Provision for credit losses (23 ) (3 ) n/m Noninterest expense 2,755 2,923 (6 ) Income before income taxes 1,449 1,892 (23 ) Income tax expense 413 492 (16 ) Net income $ 1,036 $ 1,400 (26 ) Effective tax rate 28.5 % 26.0 % Return on average allocated capital 12 16 Efficiency ratio 65.91 60.75 Balance Sheet Three Months Ended March 31 Average 2019 2018 % Change Trading-related assets: Trading account securities $ 225,254 $ 210,278 7 % Reverse repurchases 122,753 123,948 (1 ) Securities borrowed 84,343 82,376 2 Derivative assets 41,953 46,567 (10 ) Total trading-related assets 474,303 463,169 2 Total loans and leases 70,080 73,763 (5 ) Total earning assets 472,414 486,107 (3 ) Total assets 664,052 678,354 (2 ) Total deposits 31,366 32,320 (3 ) Allocated capital 35,000 35,000 Period end March 31 2019 December 31 2018 % Change Total trading-related assets $ 485,637 $ 447,998 8 % Total loans and leases 70,052 73,928 (5 ) Total earning assets 470,700 457,224 3 Total assets 671,123 641,923 5 Total deposits 31,073 37,841 (18 ) n/m = not meaningful Global Markets offers sales and trading services and research services to institutional clients across fixed-income, credit, currency, commodity and equity businesses . Global Markets product coverage includes securities and derivative products in both the primary and secondary markets. For more information about Global Markets, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Net income for Global Markets decreased $364 million to $1.0 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 . Net DVA losses were $90 million compared to gains of $64 million during the same period in 2018 . Excluding net DVA, net income decreased $247 million to $1.1 billion . These decreases were primarily driven by a decrease in revenue, partially offset by a reduction in noninterest expense. Sales and trading revenue decreased $685 million , and excluding net DVA, decreased $531 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 due to declines in both FICC and Equities revenue. The benefit in the provision for credit losses increased $20 million driven by lower loan balances. Noninterest expense decreased $168 million to $2.8 billion primarily driven by lower revenue-related expenses. Average total assets decreased $14.3 billion to $664.1 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to lower client balances in Equities. Period-end total assets increased $29.2 billion from December 31, 2018 to $671.1 billion due to higher market levels following the December sell-off in the equity markets driving higher client balances and increased levels of inventory to facilitate expected client demand. The return on average allocated capital was 12 percent , down from 16 percent compared to the same period in 2018, reflecting lower net income. Sales and Trading Revenue For a description of sales and trading revenue, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . The following table and related discussion present sales and trading revenue, substantially all of which is in Global Markets, with the remainder in Global Banking . In addition, the following table and related discussion present sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information on net DVA, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 5 . Bank of America 14 Sales and Trading Revenue (1, 2) Three Months Ended March 31 (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 Sales and trading revenue Fixed-income, currencies and commodities $ 2,279 $ 2,633 Equities 1,181 1,512 Total sales and trading revenue $ 3,460 $ 4,145 Sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA (3) Fixed-income, currencies and commodities $ 2,358 $ 2,556 Equities 1,192 1,525 Total sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA $ 3,550 $ 4,081 (1) Includes FTE adjustments of $49 million and $66 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 . For more information on sales and trading revenue, see Note 3 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . (2) Includes Global Banking sales and trading revenue of $115 million and $165 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 . (3) FICC and Equities sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, is a non-GAAP financial measure. FICC net DVA losses were $79 million and gains were $77 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 . Equities net DVA losses were $11 million and $13 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 . The following explanations for period-over-period changes in sales and trading, FICC and Equities revenue exclude net DVA, but would be the same whether net DVA was included or excluded. FICC revenue decreased $198 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 due to a reduction in client activity. The decline in FICC revenue was also impacted by higher funding costs, which were driven by increases in market interest rates. Equities revenue decreased $333 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 , which benefited from higher market volatility resulting in higher client volumes and a strong trading performance in derivatives.

Average allocated assets were $542.4 billion and $514.6 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 , and period-end allocated assets were $566.8 billion and $540.8 billion at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . n/m = not meaningful All Other consists of ALM activities, equity investments, non-core mortgage loans and servicing activities, liquidating businesses and certain expenses not otherwise allocated to a business segment. ALM activities encompass certain residential mortgages, debt securities, and interest rate and foreign currency risk management activities. Substantially all of the results of ALM activities are allocated to our business segments . Equity investments include our merchant services joint venture, as well as a portfolio of equity, real estate and other alternative investments . For information on our merchant services joint venture, including the potential financial statement impact of certain pending renewal options relative to the term of the operating agreement, see Note 11 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements . For additional information about All Other, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . The Corporation classifies consumer real estate loans as core or non-core based on loan and customer characteristics. For more information on the core and non-core portfolios, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 22 . Residential mortgage loans that are held for ALM purposes, including interest rate or liquidity risk management, are classified as core and are presented on the balance sheet of All Other . During the three months ended March 31, 2019 , residential mortgage loans held for ALM activities decreased $395 million to $24.5 billion primarily 15 Bank of America as a result of payoffs and paydowns. Non-core residential mortgage and home equity loans, which are principally runoff portfolios, are also held in All Other . During the three months ended March 31, 2019 , total non-core loans decreased $2.2 billion to $21.3 billion due primarily to payoffs and paydowns as well as sales and Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan conveyances. Results for All Other were a net loss of $48 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to net income of $3 million in the same period in 2018, driven by a decline in revenue and a lower benefit in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower noninterest expense. Revenue decreased $208 million due to a decrease in net interest income from lower loan balances, primarily non-core loans, and a decrease in noninterest income. The benefit in the provision for credit losses decreased $98 million to $54 million primarily driven by a slower pace of portfolio improvement. Noninterest expense decreased $82 million to $418 million reflecting lower non-core mortgage costs, primarily due to lower volume, a decrease in compensation and benefits, and lower FDIC expense, partially offset by higher marketing expense. The income tax benefit increased $173 million reflecting a higher pretax loss as well as increased income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking . Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have contractual obligations to make future payments on debt and lease agreements. Additionally, in the normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements whereby we commit to future purchases of products or services from unaffiliated parties. For more information on obligations and commitments, see Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein as well as Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K , and Note 11 Long-term Debt and Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Representations and Warranties Obligations For information on representations and warranties obligations in connection with the sale of mortgage loans, see Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . For more information related to the sensitivity of the assumptions used to estimate our reserve for representations and warranties, see Complex Accounting Estimates Representations and Warranties Liability in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Managing Risk Risk is inherent in all our business activities. The seven key types of risk faced by the Corporation are strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational. Sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver for our shareholders. If not managed well, risks can result in financial loss, regulatory sanctions and penalties, and damage to our reputation, each of which may adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategies. The Corporation takes a comprehensive approach to risk management with a defined Risk Framework and an articulated Risk Appetite Statement which are approved annually by the Enterprise Risk Committee and the Board. Our Risk Framework is the foundation for consistent and effective management of risks facing the Corporation. The Risk Framework sets forth clear roles, responsibilities and accountability for the management of risk and provides a blueprint for how the Board, through delegation of authority to committees and executive officers, establishes risk appetite and associated limits for our activities. Our Risk Appetite Statement is intended to ensure that the Corporation maintains an acceptable risk profile by providing a common framework and a comparable set of measures for senior management and the Board to clearly indicate the level of risk the Corporation is willing to accept. Risk appetite is set at least annually and is aligned with the Corporation strategic, capital and financial operating plans. Our line of business strategies and risk appetite are also similarly aligned. For more information on our Risk Framework, our risk management activities and the key types of risk faced by the Corporation, see the Managing Risk through Reputational Risk sections in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Capital Management The Corporation manages its capital position so that its capital is more than adequate to support its business activities and aligns with risk, risk appetite and strategic planning. Additionally, we seek to maintain safety and soundness at all times, even under adverse scenarios, take advantage of organic growth opportunities, meet obligations to creditors and counterparties, maintain ready access to financial markets, continue to serve as a credit intermediary, remain a source of strength for our subsidiaries, and satisfy current and future regulatory capital requirements. Capital management is integrated into our risk and governance processes, as capital is a key consideration in the development of our strategic plan, risk appetite and risk limits. We periodically review capital allocated to our businesses and allocate capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. For additional information, see Business Segment Operations on page 8 . CCAR and Capital Planning The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) requires BHCs to submit a capital plan and requests for capital actions on an annual basis, consistent with the rules governing the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) capital plan. In addition to our previously announced repurchases associated with the 2018 CCAR capital plan, on February 7, 2019, we announced a plan to repurchase an additional $2.5 billion of common stock through June 30, 2019, which was approved by the Federal Reserve. During the first quarter of 2019 , we repurchased $6.3 billion of common stock pursuant to the Board's repurchase authorizations. For additional information, see Capital Management CCAR and Capital Planning in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Our stock repurchases are subject to various factors, including the Corporation capital position, liquidity, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock trading price and general market conditions, and may be suspended at any time. The repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including repurchase plans that satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. As a well-capitalized BHC, we may notify the Federal Reserve of our intention to make additional capital distributions not to exceed 0.25 percent of Tier 1 capital, Bank of America 16 and which were not contemplated in our capital plan, subject to the Federal Reserve non-objection. In April 2019, we submitted our 2019 CCAR capital plan and related supervisory stress tests. The Federal Reserve has announced that it will release CCAR capital plan summary results, including supervisory projections of capital ratios, losses and revenues under stress scenarios, and publish the results of stress tests conducted under the supervisory adverse and supervisory severely adverse scenarios by June 30, 2019. Regulatory Capital As a financial services holding company, we are subject to regulatory capital rules, including Basel 3, issued by U.S. banking regulators. The Corporation and its primary affiliated banking entity, BANA, are Advanced approaches institutions under Basel 3 and are required to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and risk-weighted assets under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is used to assess capital adequacy including under the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. As of March 31, 2019 , Common equity tier 1 (CET1) and Tier 1 capital ratios for the Corporation were lower under the Standardized approach whereas the Advanced approaches yielded a lower Total capital ratio. For more information on Basel 3, see Capital Management in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Minimum Capital Requirements Minimum capital requirements and related buffers were fully phased in as of January 1, 2019. The PCA framework established categories of capitalization, including well capitalized, based on the Basel 3 regulatory ratio requirements. U.S. banking regulators are required to take certain mandatory actions depending on the category of capitalization, with no mandatory actions required for well-capitalized banking organizations. In order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments, the Corporation must meet risk-based capital ratio requirements that include a capital conservation buffer greater than 2.5 percent, plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer and a global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge. The buffers and surcharge must be comprised solely of CET1 capital. The Corporation is also required to maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Our insured depository institution subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be considered well capitalized under the PCA framework. Capital Composition and Ratios Table 7 presents Bank of America Corporation capital ratios and related information in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced approaches as measured at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . As of the periods presented, the Corporation met the definition of well capitalized under current regulatory requirements.

The countercyclical capital buffer for both periods is zero . The SLR minimum includes a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent. (2) Total capital under the Advanced approaches differs from the Standardized approach due to differences in the amount permitted in Tier 2 capital related to the qualifying allowance for credit losses. (3) Reflects adjusted average total assets for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . 17 Bank of America CET1 capital was $169.2 billion at March 31, 2019 , an increase of $2.0 billion from December 31, 2018 , driven by earnings and lower net unrealized losses on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities included in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI), partially offset by common stock repurchases and dividends. During the three months ended March 31, 2019 , Total capital under the Advanced approaches increased $2.8 billion primarily driven by the same factors as CET1 capital. Risk-weighted assets under the Standardized approach, which yielded the lower CET1 capital ratio for March 31, 2019 , increased $ 17.5 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2019 to $1,455 billion primarily due to an increase in other assets and client activity in Global Markets , partially offset by lower U.S. credit card loans.

Bank of America 18 Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity Requirements Effective January 1, 2019, the Corporation is subject to the Federal Reserve final rule requiring G-SIBs to maintain minimum levels of total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) and long-term debt. TLAC consists of the Corporation Tier 1 capital and eligible long-term debt issued directly by the Corporation. Eligible long-term debt for TLAC ratios is comprised of unsecured debt that has a remaining maturity of at least one year and satisfies additional requirements as prescribed in the TLAC final rule. As with the risk-based capital ratios and SLR, the Corporation is required to maintain TLAC ratios in excess of minimum requirements plus applicable buffers in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Table 11 presents the Corporation's TLAC and long-term debt ratios and related information as of March 31, 2019 . Table 11 Bank of America Corporation Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity and Long-Term Debt TLAC Regulatory Minimum (1) Long-term Debt Regulatory Minimum (2) (Dollars in millions, except ratios) March 31, 2019 Total eligible balance $ 360,927 $ 165,568 Percentage of risk-weighted assets (3) 24.8 % 22.0 % 11.4 % 8.5 % Percentage of SLR leverage exposure 12.8 9.5 5.9 4.5 (1) The TLAC risk-weighted assets regulatory minimum consists of 18.0 percent plus a TLAC risk-weighted assets buffer comprised of 2.5 percent plus the method 1 G-SIB surcharge of 1.5 percent. The countercyclical buffer is zero for this period. The TLAC SLR leverage exposure regulatory minimum consists of 7.5 percent plus a 2.0 percent TLAC leverage buffer. The TLAC risk-weighted assets and leverage buffers must be comprised solely of CET1 capital and Tier 1 capital, respectively. (2) The long-term debt risk-weighted assets regulatory minimum is comprised of 6.0 percent plus an additional 2.5 percent requirement based on the Corporation method 2 G-SIB surcharge. (3) The approach that yields the higher risk-weighted assets is used to calculate TLAC and long-term debt ratios, which was the Standardized approach as of March 31, 2019. Regulatory Developments The following supplements the disclosure in Capital Management Regulatory Developments in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Deduction of Unsecured Debt of G-SIBs On April 2, 2019, the U.S. banking regulators issued a proposal that would require Advanced approaches firms to deduct investments in TLAC-eligible long-term debt and other pari passu or subordinated debt instruments issued by G-SIBs above a certain threshold from regulatory capital. The proposal is intended to limit the interconnectedness between G-SIBs and is complementary to existing regulatory capital requirements that generally require banks to deduct investments in the regulatory capital of financial institutions. Broker-dealer Regulatory Capital and Securities Regulation The Corporation principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (MLPF&S) and Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp (MLPCC). MLPCC is a fully-guaranteed subsidiary of MLPF&S and provides clearing and settlement services. Both entities are subject to the net capital requirements of SEC Rule 15c3-1. Both entities are also registered as futures commission merchants and are subject to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission Regulation 1.17. MLPF&S has elected to compute the minimum capital requirement in accordance with the Alternative Net Capital Requirement as permitted by SEC Rule 15c3-1. At March 31, 2019 , MLPF&S regulatory net capital as defined by Rule 15c3-1 was $13.3 billion and exceeded the minimum requirement of $2.1 billion by $11.1 billion. MLPCC net capital of $4.9 billion exceeded the minimum requirement of $588 million by $4.3 billion. In accordance with the Alternative Net Capital Requirements, MLPF&S is required to maintain tentative net capital in excess of $1.0 billion and net capital in excess of $500 million and to notify the SEC in the event its tentative net capital is less than $5.0 billion. At March 31, 2019 , MLPF&S had tentative net capital and net capital in excess of the minimum and notification requirements. As a result of resolution planning, the current business of MLPF&S is expected to be reorganized into two affiliated broker- dealers: MLPF&S and BofA Securities, Inc., a newly formed broker-dealer. Under the contemplated reorganization, which is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2019, BofA Securities, Inc. would become the legal entity for the institutional services that are now provided by MLPF&S. MLPF&S retail services would remain with MLPF&S. For more information on resolution planning, see Item 1. Business Resolution Planning of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . MLI, a U.K. investment firm, is regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority, and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. At March 31, 2019 , MLI capital resources were $35.0 billion, which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $13.6 billion. Liquidity Risk Funding and Liquidity Risk Management Our primary liquidity risk management objective is to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral needs while continuing to support our businesses and customers under a range of economic conditions. To achieve that objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk under expected and stressed conditions, maintain liquidity and access to diverse funding sources, including our stable deposit base, and seek to align liquidity-related incentives and risks. We define liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we can use to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations as those obligations arise. We manage our liquidity position through line of business and ALM activities, as well as through our legal entity funding strategy, on both a forward and current (including intraday) basis under both expected and stressed conditions. We believe that a centralized approach to funding and liquidity management enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding sources, minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events. For more information regarding global funding and liquidity risk management, as well as our liquidity sources, liquidity arrangements, contingency planning and credit ratings discussed below, see Liquidity Risk in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 19 Bank of America NB Holdings Corporation We have intercompany arrangements with certain key subsidiaries under which we transferred certain assets of Bank of America Corporation, as the parent company, which is a separate and distinct legal entity from our banking and nonbank subsidiaries, and agreed to transfer certain additional parent company assets not needed to satisfy anticipated near-term expenditures, to NB Holdings Corporation, a wholly-owned holding company subsidiary (NB Holdings). The parent company is expected to continue to have access to the same flow of dividends, interest and other amounts of cash necessary to service its debt, pay dividends and perform other obligations as it would have had if it had not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets. These arrangements support our preferred single point of entry resolution strategy, under which only the parent company would be resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Global Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets Table 12 presents average Global Liquidity Sources (GLS) for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . Table 12 Average Global Liquidity Sources Three Months Ended (Dollars in billions) March 31 2019 December 31 2018 Parent company and NB Holdings $ 65 $ 76 Bank subsidiaries 429 420 Other regulated entities 52 48 Total Average Global Liquidity Sources $ 546 $ 544 We maintain liquidity available to the Corporation, including the parent company and selected subsidiaries, in the form of cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Typically, parent company and NB Holdings liquidity is in the form of cash deposited with BANA. Our bank subsidiaries liquidity is primarily driven by deposit and lending activity, as well as securities valuation and net debt activity. Liquidity at bank subsidiaries excludes the cash deposited by the parent company and NB Holdings. Our bank subsidiaries can also generate incremental liquidity by pledging a range of unencumbered loans and securities to certain Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against this pool of specifically-identified eligible assets was $354 billion and $344 billion at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . We have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against these assets, including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loans and securities collateral. Eligibility is defined in guidelines from the FHLBs and the Federal Reserve and is subject to change at their discretion. Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries can generally be used only to fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries, and transfers to the parent company or nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to prior regulatory approval. Liquidity held in other regulated entities, comprised primarily of broker-dealer subsidiaries, is primarily available to meet the obligations of that entity and transfers to the parent company or to any other subsidiary may be subject to prior regulatory approval due to regulatory restrictions and minimum requirements. Our other regulated entities also hold unencumbered investment-grade securities and equities that we believe could be used to generate additional liquidity. Table 13 presents the composition of average GLS for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . Table 13 Average Global Liquidity Sources Composition Three Months Ended (Dollars in billions) March 31 2019 December 31 2018 Cash on deposit $ 115 $ 113 U.S. Treasury securities 83 81 U.S. agency securities and mortgage-backed securities 338 340 Non-U.S. government securities 10 10 Total Average Global Liquidity Sources $ 546 $ 544 Our GLS are substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the final U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) rules. However, HQLA for purposes of calculating LCR is not reported at market value, but at a lower value that incorporates regulatory deductions and the exclusion of excess liquidity held at certain subsidiaries. The LCR is calculated as the amount of a financial institution unencumbered HQLA relative to the estimated net cash outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period of significant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. Our average consolidated HQLA, on a net basis, was $444 billion and $446 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . For the same periods, the average consolidated LCR was 115 percent and 118 percent . Our LCR will fluctuate due to normal business flows from customer activity. Liquidity Stress Analysis We utilize liquidity stress analysis to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our subsidiaries to meet contractual and contingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios. For more information on our liquidity stress analysis, see Liquidity Risk Liquidity Stress Analysis in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Diversified Funding Sources We fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits, and secured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally coordinated funding approach diversified across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups. We fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposits, which were $1.38 trillion at both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . Our trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded on a secured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements, and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions. Long-term Debt During the three months ended March 31, 2019 , we issued $14.7 billion of long-term debt consisting of $9.6 billion for Bank of America Corporation, substantially all of which was TLAC eligible, $1.5 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $3.6 billion of other debt. Substantially all of the long-term, TLAC-eligible senior notes issued by Bank of America Corporation since late 2016 are callable, at our option, at least one year before each stated maturity date. The call features give us the flexibility to retire long-term notes before their final year outstanding, when they are no longer eligible to count toward TLAC requirements, and replace them with new TLAC-eligible debt, should we choose to do so. Bank of America 20 During the three months ended March 31, 2019 , we had total long-term debt maturities and redemptions in the aggregate of $14.3 billion consisting of $6.2 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $5.6 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $2.5 billion of other debt. Table 14 presents the carrying value of aggregate annual contractual maturities of long-term debt at March 31, 2019 .

(2) Represents the total long-term debt included in the liabilities of consolidated VIEs on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Table 15 presents our long-term debt by major currency at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 .

We may, from time to time, purchase outstanding debt instruments in various transactions, depending on market conditions, liquidity and other factors. Our other regulated entities may also make markets in our debt instruments to provide liquidity for investors. For more information on long-term debt funding, see Note 11 Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . We use derivative transactions to manage the duration, interest rate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering the characteristics of the assets they are funding. For more information on our ALM activities, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 39 . We may issue unsecured debt in the form of structured notes for client purposes, certain of which qualify as TLAC-eligible debt. During the three months ended March 31, 2019 , we issued $1.8 billion of structured notes, which are debt obligations that pay investors returns linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these liabilities with derivatives and/or investments in the underlying instruments, so that from a funding perspective, the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We could be required to settle certain structured note obligations for cash or other securities prior to maturity under certain circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning purposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date. Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price. Credit Ratings Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating agencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other securities, including asset securitizations. On March 6, 2019, Moody Investors Service (Moody s) upgraded the long-term and short-term ratings of the Corporation by one notch to A2/P-1 from A3/P-2 for senior debt, as well as the long-term ratings of its rated subsidiaries, including BANA, which the agency upgraded to Aa2 from Aa3 for senior debt. Moody concurrently affirmed the short-term ratings of the Corporation rated subsidiaries, including BANA. Moody cited the Corporation strengthening profitability, continued adherence to a conservative risk profile, and stable capital ratios as rationale for the upgrade. This concluded the review for upgrade that Moody initiated on December 5, 2018. The rating outlook for all long-term ratings is currently stable. The ratings from Standard & Poor Global Ratings (S&P) and Fitch Ratings for the Corporation and its subsidiaries did not 21 Bank of America change from those disclosed in the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Table 16 presents the Corporation current long-term/short-term senior debt ratings and outlooks expressed by the rating agencies. For more information on additional collateral and termination payments that could be required in connection with certain over- the-counter derivative contracts and other trading agreements as a result of a credit rating downgrade, see Note 3 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein and Item 1A.

For information on the new accounting standard on credit losses that is effective on January 1, 2020 and the potential impact on our allowance for credit losses, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Credit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower credit cycle. Statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio management including underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting credit limits, and establishing operating processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns. Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources such as credit bureaus and/or internal historical experience and are a component of our consumer credit risk management process. These models are used in part to assist in making both new and ongoing credit decisions, as well as portfolio management strategies, including authorizations and line management, collection practices and strategies, and determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allocated capital for credit risk. Consumer Credit Portfolio Improvement in home prices continued during the three months ended March 31, 2019 resulting in improved credit quality compared to December 31, 2018 . Additionally, lower credit losses in the consumer real estate portfolio were partially offset by seasoning in the U.S. credit card portfolio compared to the same period in 2018 . Improved credit quality and continued loan balance runoff primarily in the non-core consumer real estate portfolio, partially offset by seasoning within the U.S. credit card portfolio, drove a $46 million decrease in the consumer allowance for loan and lease losses during the three months ended March 31, 2019 to $4.8 billion . For additional information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 35 . For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, charge-offs and troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) for the consumer portfolio, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 5 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Table 17 presents our outstanding consumer loans and leases, consumer nonperforming loans and accruing consumer loans past due 90 days or more. Nonperforming loans do not include past due consumer credit card loans, other unsecured loans and in general, consumer loans not secured by real estate (bankruptcy loans are included) as these loans are typically charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due. Real estate-secured past due consumer loans that are insured by the FHA or individually insured under long-term standby agreements with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (collectively, the fully-insured loan portfolio) are reported as accruing as opposed to nonperforming since the principal repayment is insured. Fully-insured loans included in accruing past due 90 days or more are primarily from our repurchases of delinquent FHA loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA). Nonperforming loans and accruing balances past due 90 days or more also do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option even though the customer may be contractually past due.

At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , residential mortgage includes $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion of loans on which interest had been curtailed by the FHA, and therefore were no longer accruing interest, although principal was still insured, and $391 million and $498 million of loans on which interest was still accruing. (2) Outstandings include auto and specialty lending loans and leases of $49.9 billion and $50.1 billion , unsecured consumer lending loans of $355 million and $383 million , U.S. securities-based lending loans of $35.8 billion and $37.0 billion , non-U.S. consumer loans of $2.8 billion and $2.9 billion and other consumer loans of $697 million and $746 million at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . (3) Substantially all of other consumer at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 is consumer overdrafts. (4) Consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option include residential mortgage loans of $315 million and $336 million and home equity loans of $353 million and $346 million at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . For more information on the fair value option, see Note 16 Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements . (5) Excludes consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option. At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , $10 million and $12 million of loans accounted for under the fair value option were past due 90 days or more and not accruing interest. n/a = not applicable Table 18 presents net charge-offs and related ratios for consumer loans and leases.

We categorize consumer real estate loans as core and non-core based on loan and customer characteristics such as origination date, product type, loan-to-value (LTV), Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score and delinquency status consistent with our current consumer and mortgage servicing strategy. Generally, loans that were originated after January 1, 2010, qualified under government-sponsored enterprise underwriting guidelines, or otherwise met our underwriting guidelines in place in 2015 are characterized as core loans. All other loans are generally characterized as non-core loans and represent runoff portfolios. Core loans as reported in Table 19 include loans held in the Consumer Banking and GWIM segments, as well as loans held for ALM activities in All Other . As shown in Table 19 , outstanding core consumer real estate loans increased $3.5 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2019 driven by an increase of $4.8 billion in residential mortgage, partially offset by a $1.3 billion decrease in home equity. During the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 , we sold $950 million and $825 million of consumer real estate loans. 23 Bank of America Table 19 Consumer Real Estate Portfolio (1) Outstandings Nonperforming Net Charge-offs March 31 2019 December 31 2018 March 31 2019 December 31 2018 Three Months Ended March 31 (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 Core portfolio Residential mortgage $ 198,524 $ 193,695 $ 976 $ 1,010 $ (3 ) $ 9 Home equity 38,706 40,010 906 955 21 23 Total core portfolio 237,230 233,705 1,882 1,965 18 32 Non-core portfolio Residential mortgage 13,499 14,862 797 883 (13 ) (15 ) Home equity 7,535 8,276 845 938 (10 ) 10 Total non-core portfolio 21,034 23,138 1,642 1,821 (23 ) (5 ) Consumer real estate portfolio Residential mortgage 212,023 208,557 1,773 1,893 (16 ) (6 ) Home equity 46,241 48,286 1,751 1,893 11 33 Total consumer real estate portfolio $ 258,264 $ 256,843 $ 3,524 $ 3,786 $ (5 ) $ 27 Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Provision for Loan and Lease Losses March 31 2019 December 31 2018 Three Months Ended March 31 2019 2018 Core portfolio Residential mortgage $ 213 $ 214 $ (4 ) $ 8 Home equity 185 228 (22 ) (1 ) Total core portfolio 398 442 (26 ) 7 Non-core portfolio Residential mortgage 166 208 (31 ) (86 ) Home equity 258 278 (13 ) (49 ) Total non-core portfolio 424 486 (44 ) (135 ) Consumer real estate portfolio Residential mortgage 379 422 (35 ) (78 ) Home equity 443 506 (35 ) (50 ) Total consumer real estate portfolio $ 822 $ 928 $ (70 ) $ (128 ) (1) Outstandings and nonperforming loans exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. Consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option included residential mortgage loans of $315 million and $336 million and home equity loans of $353 million and $346 million at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . For additional information, see Note 16 Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements . We believe that the presentation of information adjusted to exclude the impact of the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option is more representative of the ongoing operations and credit quality of the business. As a result, in the following tables and discussions of the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios, we exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option and provide information that excludes the impact of the fully-insured loan portfolio in certain credit quality statistics. Residential Mortgage The residential mortgage portfolio made up the largest percentage of our consumer loan portfolio at 48 percent of consumer loans and leases at March 31, 2019 . Approximately 46 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio was in Consumer Banking and 37 percent was in GWIM. The remaining portion was in All Other and was comprised of originated loans, purchased loans used in our overall ALM activities, delinquent FHA loans repurchased pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA as well as loans repurchased related to our representations and warranties. Outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio increased $3.5 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2019 as retention of new originations was partially offset by loan sales of $838 million and runoff. At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , the residential mortgage portfolio included $19.6 billion and $20.1 billion of outstanding fully-insured loans, of which $13.3 billion and $14.0 billion had FHA insurance with the remainder protected by long-term standby agreements. At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , $3.1 billion and $3.5 billion of the FHA-insured loan population were repurchases of delinquent FHA loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA. Table 20 presents certain residential mortgage key credit statistics on both a reported basis and excluding the fully-insured loan portfolio. The following discussion presents the residential mortgage portfolio excluding the fully-insured loan portfolio. Bank of America 24 Table 20 Residential Mortgage Key Credit Statistics Reported Basis (1) Excluding Fully-insured Loans (1) (Dollars in millions) March 31 2019 December 31 2018 March 31 2019 December 31 2018 Outstandings $ 212,023 $ 208,557 $ 192,389 $ 188,427 Accruing past due 30 days or more 3,410 3,945 1,020 1,155 Accruing past due 90 days or more 1,593 1,884 Nonperforming loans 1,773 1,893 1,773 1,893 Percent of portfolio Refreshed LTV greater than 90 but less than or equal to 100 2 % 2 % 2 % 2 % Refreshed LTV greater than 100 1 1 1 1 Refreshed FICO below 620 3 4 2 2 2006 and 2007 vintages (2) 5 6 5 6 Three Months Ended March 31 2019 2018 2019 2018 Net charge-off ratio (3) (0.03 )% (0.01 )% (0.03 )% (0.01 )% (1) Outstandings, accruing past due, nonperforming loans and percentages of portfolio exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. (2) These vintages of loans accounted for $495 million and $536 million , or 28 percent for both periods, of nonperforming residential mortgage loans at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . (3) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as annualized net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option. Nonperforming residential mortgage loans decreased $120 million during the three months ended March 31, 2019 primarily driven by sales. Of the nonperforming residential mortgage loans at March 31, 2019 , $701 million , or 40 percent , were current on contractual payments. Loans accruing past due 30 days or more decreased $135 million due to continued improvement in credit quality as well as loan sales in the non-core portfolio. Net recoveries increased $10 million to $16 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to continued improvement in credit quality. Loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent represented one percent of the residential mortgage loan portfolio at both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . Of the loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent, 99 percent were performing at both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . Loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent reflect loans where the outstanding carrying value of the loan is greater than the most recent valuation of the property securing the loan. Of the $192.4 billion in total residential mortgage loans outstanding at March 31, 2019 , as shown in Table 20 , 29 percent were originated as interest-only loans. The outstanding balance of interest-only residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period was $8.9 billion , or 16 percent , at March 31, 2019 . Residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period generally have experienced a higher rate of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status compared to the residential mortgage portfolio as a whole. At March 31, 2019 , $196 million , or two percent , of outstanding interest-only residential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $1.0 billion , or one percent , for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, at March 31, 2019 , $367 million , or four percent , of outstanding interest-only residential mortgage loans that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming, of which $126 million were contractually current, compared to $1.8 billion , or one percent , for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. Loans that have yet to enter the amortization period in our interest-only residential mortgage portfolio are primarily well-collateralized loans to our wealth management clients and have an interest-only period of three to ten years. Approximately 91 percent of these loans that have yet to enter the amortization period will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2022 or later. Table 21 presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the residential mortgage portfolio. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) within California represented 16 percent of outstandings at both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 13 percent of outstandings at both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 .

(3) Amounts exclude the fully-insured loan portfolio. 25 Bank of America Home Equity At March 31, 2019 , the home equity portfolio made up 10 percent of the consumer portfolio and was comprised of home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), home equity loans and reverse mortgages. At March 31, 2019 , our HELOC portfolio had an outstanding balance of $42.7 billion , or 92 percent of the total home equity portfolio, compared to $44.3 billion , also 92 percent , at December 31, 2018 . HELOCs generally have an initial draw period of 10 years, and after the initial draw period ends, the loans generally convert to 15- or 20-year amortizing loans. At March 31, 2019 , our home equity loan portfolio had an outstanding balance of $1.7 billion , or four percent of the total home equity portfolio, compared to $1.8 billion , also four percent , at December 31, 2018 . Home equity loans are almost all fixed-rate loans with amortizing payment terms of 10 to 30 years, and of the $1.7 billion at March 31, 2019 , 68 percent have 25- to 30-year terms. At March 31, 2019 , our reverse mortgage portfolio had an outstanding balance of $1.8 billion , or four percent of the total home equity portfolio, compared to $2.2 billion , also four percent , at December 31, 2018 . We no longer originate reverse mortgages. At March 31, 2019 , 76 percent of the home equity portfolio was in Consumer Banking , 16 percent was in All Other and the remainder of the portfolio was primarily in GWIM . Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased $2.0 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2019 primarily due to paydowns outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines. Of the total home equity portfolio at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , $16.6 billion and $17.3 billion , or 36 percent for both periods, were in first-lien positions. At March 31, 2019 , outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio that were in a second-lien or more junior-lien position and where we also held the first-lien loan totaled $7.8 billion , or 17 percent of our total home equity portfolio. Unused HELOCs totaled $43.8 billion at March 31, 2019 compared to $43.1 billion at December 31, 2018 . The increase was primarily driven by the impact of new production partially offset by accounts reaching the end of their draw period, which automatically eliminates open line exposure, and customers choosing to close accounts. The HELOC utilization rate was 49 percent and 51 percent at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . Table 22 presents certain home equity portfolio key credit statistics. Table 22 Home Equity Key Credit Statistics (1) (Dollars in millions) March 31 2019 December 31 2018 Outstandings $ 46,241 $ 48,286 Accruing past due 30 days or more (2) 315 363 Nonperforming loans (2) 1,751 1,893 Percent of portfolio Refreshed CLTV greater than 90 but less than or equal to 100 2 % 2 % Refreshed CLTV greater than 100 3 3 Refreshed FICO below 620 5 5 2006 and 2007 vintages (3) 22 22 Three Months Ended March 31 2019 2018 Net charge-off ratio (4) 0.10 % 0.23 % (1) Outstandings, accruing past due, nonperforming loans and percentages of the portfolio exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. (2) Accruing past due 30 days or more include $45 million and $48 million and nonperforming loans include $198 million and $218 million of loans where we serviced the underlying first lien at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . (3) These vintages of loans have higher refreshed combined loan-to-value (CLTV) ratios and accounted for 48 percent and 49 percent of nonperforming home equity loans at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , and 25 percent and 89 percent of net charge-offs in the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 . (4) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as annualized net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option. Nonperforming outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased $142 million during the three months ended March 31, 2019 as outflows, including sales, outpaced new inflows. Of the nonperforming home equity loans at March 31, 2019 , $1.1 billion , or 62 percent , were current on contractual payments. Nonperforming loans that are contractually current primarily consist of collateral-dependent TDRs, including those that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, junior-lien loans where the underlying first lien is 90 days or more past due, as well as loans that have not yet demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance following a TDR. We estimate that approximately $197 million of junior-lien loans had first-lien loans that were 90 days or more past due. In addition, $383 million , or 22 percent , of nonperforming home equity loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell. Accruing loans that were 30 days or more past due decreased $48 million during the three months ended March 31, 2019 . Net charge-offs decreased $22 million to $11 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 driven by favorable portfolio trends due in part to improvement in home prices and the U.S. economy. Outstanding balances with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent comprised three percent of the home equity portfolio at both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . Outstanding balances with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent reflect loans where our loan and available line of credit combined with any outstanding senior liens against the property are equal to or greater than the most recent valuation of the property securing the loan. Depending on the value of the property, there may be collateral in excess of the first lien that is available to reduce the severity of loss on the second lien. Of those outstanding balances with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent, 95 percent of the customers were current on their home equity loan and 91 percent of second-lien loans with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent were current on both their second-lien and underlying first-lien loans at March 31, 2019 . Of the $46.2 billion in total home equity portfolio outstandings at March 31, 2019 , as shown in Table 22 , 19 percent require interest-only payments. The outstanding balance of HELOCs that have reached the end of their draw period and have entered the Bank of America 26 amortization period was $15.2 billion at March 31, 2019 . The HELOCs that have entered the amortization period have experienced a higher percentage of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status when compared to the HELOC portfolio as a whole. At March 31, 2019 , $239 million , or two percent , of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more. In addition, at March 31, 2019 , $1.6 billion , or 10 percent , of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming. Loans that have yet to enter the amortization period in our interest-only portfolio are primarily post-2008 vintages and generally have better credit quality than the previous vintages that had entered the amortization period. We communicate to contractually current customers more than a year prior to the end of their draw period to inform them of the potential change to the payment structure before entering the amortization period, and provide payment options to customers prior to the end of the draw period. Although we do not actively track how many of our home equity customers pay only the minimum amount due on their home equity loans and lines, we can infer some of this information through a review of our HELOC portfolio that we service and that is still in its revolving period. During the three months ended March 31, 2019 , 25 percent of these customers with an outstanding balance did not pay any principal on their HELOCs. Table 23 presents outstandings, nonperforming balances and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the home equity portfolio. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 13 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California made up 11 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 .

(2) In these states, foreclosure requires a court order following a legal proceeding (judicial states). U.S. Credit Card At March 31, 2019 , 97 percent of the U.S. credit card portfolio was managed in Consumer Banking with the remainder in GWIM . Outstandings in the U.S. credit card portfolio decreased $5.3 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2019 to $93.0 billion due to a seasonal decline in purchase volumes. Net charge-offs increased $44 million to $745 million during the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 due to portfolio seasoning. U.S. credit card loans 30 days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased $57 million during the three months ended March 31, 2019 from seasonal declines, while loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest increased $11 million . Unused lines of credit for U.S. credit card totaled $340.8 billion and $334.8 billion at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . The increase in unused lines was driven by seasonally lower purchase volumes as well as account growth and lines of credit increases. Table 24 presents certain state concentrations for the U.S. credit card portfolio.

Outstandings in the direct/indirect portfolio decreased $1.6 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2019 to $89.5 billion primarily due to declines in securities-based lending driven by repayments and lower draws. Net charge-offs decreased $5 million to $54 million during the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 . 27 Bank of America Table 25 presents certain state concentrations for the direct/indirect consumer loan portfolio.

During the three months ended March 31, 2019 , nonperforming consumer loans decreased $264 million to $3.6 billion primarily driven by loan sales of $164 million . At March 31, 2019 , $992 million , or 28 percent , of nonperforming loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to their estimated property value less costs to sell. In addition, at March 31, 2019 , $1.8 billion , or 51 percent , of nonperforming consumer loans were modified and are now current after successful trial periods, or are current loans classified as nonperforming loans in accordance with applicable policies. Foreclosed properties decreased $8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2019 to $236 million as liquidations outpaced additions. Certain delinquent government-guaranteed loans (principally FHA-insured loans) are excluded from our nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties activity as we expect we will be reimbursed once the property is conveyed to the guarantor for principal and, up to certain limits, costs incurred during the foreclosure process and interest accrued during the holding period. We classify junior-lien home equity loans as nonperforming when the first-lien loan becomes 90 days past due even if the junior-lien loan is performing. At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , $197 million and $221 million of such junior-lien home equity loans were included in nonperforming loans and leases. Nonperforming loans also include certain loans that have been modified in TDRs where economic concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. Nonperforming TDRs are included in Table 26 . Table 26 Nonperforming Consumer Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity Three Months Ended March 31 (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 Nonperforming loans and leases, January 1 $ 3,842 $ 5,166 Additions 391 812 Reductions: Paydowns and payoffs (188 ) (245 ) Sales (164 ) (269 ) Returns to performing status (1) (249 ) (364 ) Charge-offs (28 ) (147 ) Transfers to foreclosed properties (26 ) (45 ) Transfers to loans held-for-sale (2 ) Total net reductions to nonperforming loans and leases (264 ) (260 ) Total nonperforming loans and leases, March 31 3,578 4,906 Foreclosed properties, March 31 (2) 236 264 Nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties, March 31 $ 3,814 $ 5,170 Nonperforming consumer loans and leases as a percentage of outstanding consumer loans and leases (3) 0.81 % 1.10 % Nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties as a percentage of outstanding consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties (3) 0.86 1.16 (1) Consumer loans may be returned to performing status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected, or when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection.

(2) Residential mortgage performing TDRs included $2.5 billion and $2.8 billion of loans that were fully-insured at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . (3) At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , home equity TDRs deemed collateral dependent totaled $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion , and included $934 million and $961 million of loans classified as nonperforming and $313 million and $322 million of loans classified as performing. In addition to modifying consumer real estate loans, we work with customers who are experiencing financial difficulty by modifying credit card and other consumer loans. Credit card and other consumer loan modifications generally involve a reduction in the customer interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months, all of which are considered TDRs (the renegotiated TDR portfolio). Modifications of credit card and other consumer loans are made through renegotiation programs utilizing direct customer contact, but may also utilize external renegotiation programs. The renegotiated TDR portfolio is excluded in large part from Table 26 as substantially all of the loans remain on accrual status until either charged off or paid in full. At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , our renegotiated TDR portfolio was $600 million and $566 million , of which $510 million and $481 million were current or less than 30 days past due under the modified terms. The increase in the renegotiated TDR portfolio was primarily driven by new renegotiated enrollments outpacing runoff of existing portfolios. Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Commercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal that concentrations of credit exposure continue to be aligned with our risk appetite. We review, measure and manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, customer relationship and loan size. We also review, measure and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property type. In addition, within our non-U.S. portfolio, we evaluate exposures by region and by country. Tables 32 , 35 and 38 summarize our concentrations. We also utilize syndications of exposure to third parties, loan sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio. For more information on our industry concentrations, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Industry Concentrations on page 32 and Table 35 . For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status and net charge-offs for the commercial portfolio, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Commercial Credit Portfolio During the three months ended March 31, 2019 , credit quality among large corporate and middle-market borrowers in our commercial and industrial portfolio remained strong. Credit quality of commercial real estate borrowers in most sectors remained stable with conservative LTV ratios. However, some of the commercial real estate markets experienced slowing tenant demand and decelerating rental income. Total commercial utilized credit exposure decreased $3.1 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2019 to $617.9 billion primarily driven by lower held-for-sale loan exposure. The utilization rate for loans and leases, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and financial guarantees, and commercial letters of credit, in the aggregate, was 59 percent at both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . Table 28 presents commercial credit exposure by type for utilized, unfunded and total binding committed credit exposure. Commercial utilized credit exposure includes SBLCs and financial guarantees and commercial letters of credit that have been issued and for which we are legally bound to advance funds under prescribed conditions during a specified time period, and excludes exposure related to trading account assets.

Table 31 presents commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure by loan type. Criticized exposure corresponds to the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful asset categories as defined by regulatory authorities. Total commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure increased $760 million , or seven percent , during the three months ended March 31, 2019 driven by a few single-name downgrades and was not indicative of broader issues in the portfolio. At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , 90 percent and 91 percent of commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure was secured.

Bank of America 30 Commercial and Industrial Commercial and industrial loans include U.S. commercial and non-U.S. commercial portfolios. U.S. Commercial At March 31, 2019 , 71 percent of the U.S. commercial loan portfolio, excluding small business, was managed in Global Banking, 14 percent in Global Markets , 12 percent in GWIM (generally business-purpose loans for high net worth clients) and the remainder primarily in Consumer Banking . U.S. commercial loans increased $1.1 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2019 , primarily in Global Banking . Net charge-offs increased $59 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 due to a single-name utility client. Reservable criticized utilized exposure increased $608 million , or eight percent , driven by a few single-name downgrades. Non-U.S. Commercial At March 31, 2019 , 81 percent of the non-U.S. commercial loan portfolio was managed in Global Banking and 19 percent in Global Markets . Non-U.S. commercial loans increased $2.3 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2019 , primarily in Global Banking . Reservable criticized utilized exposure increased $104 million , or 10 percent , driven by a single-name downgrade. For more information on the non-U.S. commercial portfolio, see Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 34 . Commercial Real Estate Commercial real estate primarily includes commercial loans and leases secured by non-owner-occupied real estate and is dependent on the sale or lease of the real estate as the primary source of repayment. Outstanding loans increased $370 million , or one percent , during the three months ended March 31, 2019 to $61.2 billion due to new originations slightly outpacing paydowns. The portfolio remains diversified across property types and geographic regions. California represented the largest state concentration at 23 percent of the commercial real estate portfolio at both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . The commercial real estate portfolio is predominantly managed in Global Banking and consists of loans made primarily to public and private developers, and commercial real estate firms. For the three months ended March 31, 2019 , we continued to see low default rates and solid credit quality in both the residential and non-residential portfolios. We use a number of proactive risk mitigation initiatives to reduce adversely rated exposure in the commercial real estate portfolio, including transfers of deteriorating exposures to management by independent special asset officers and the pursuit of loan restructurings or asset sales to achieve the best results for our customers and the Corporation. Nonperforming commercial real estate loans and foreclosed properties increased $60 million , or 28 percent , during the three months ended March 31, 2019 to $272 million , due to a single-name downgrade.

U.S. Small Business Commercial The U.S. small business commercial loan portfolio is comprised of small business card loans and small business loans managed in Consumer Banking . Credit card-related products were 52 percent and 51 percent of the U.S. small business commercial portfolio at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . Of the U.S. small business commercial net charge-offs, 95 percent were credit card-related products for both the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 . Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity Table 33 presents the nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity during the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 . Nonperforming loans do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. During the three months ended March 31, 2019 , nonperforming commercial loans and leases increased $170 million to $1.3 billion . At March 31, 2019 , 93 percent of commercial nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties were secured and 61 percent were contractually current. Commercial nonperforming loans were carried at 93 percent of their unpaid principal balance before consideration of the allowance for loan and lease losses as the carrying value of these loans has been reduced to the estimated collateral value less costs to sell. 31 Bank of America Table 33 Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity (1, 2) Three Months Ended March 31 (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 Nonperforming loans and leases, January 1 $ 1,102 $ 1,304 Additions 640 436 Reductions: Paydowns (108 ) (169 ) Sales (43 ) (24 ) Returns to performing status (3) (34 ) (27 ) Charge-offs (97 ) (48 ) Transfers to foreclosed properties (7 ) Transfers to loans held-for-sale (181 ) Total net reductions to nonperforming loans and leases 170 168 Total nonperforming loans and leases, March 31 1,272 1,472 Foreclosed properties, March 31 59 52 Nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties, March 31 $ 1,331 $ 1,524 Nonperforming commercial loans and leases as a percentage of outstanding commercial loans and leases (4) 0.26 % 0.31 % Nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties as a percentage of outstanding commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties (4) 0.27 0.32 (1) Balances do not include nonperforming loans held-for-sale of $457 million and $228 million at March 31, 2019 and 2018 . (2) Includes U.S. small business commercial activity. Small business card loans are excluded as they are not classified as nonperforming. (3) Commercial loans and leases may be returned to performing status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected, or when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection. TDRs are generally classified as performing after a sustained period of demonstrated payment performance. (4) Outstanding commercial loans exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. Table 34 presents our commercial TDRs by product type and performing status. U.S. small business commercial TDRs are comprised of renegotiated small business card loans and small business loans. The renegotiated small business card loans are not classified as nonperforming as they are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due. For more information on TDRs, see Note 5 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements .

Our commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. Total commercial committed exposure decreased $5.5 billion , or one percent, during the three months ended March 31, 2019 to $1.0 trillion . The decrease in commercial committed exposure was concentrated in the Pharmaceuticals and Biotechnology, Asset Managers and Funds and Insurance industry sectors. Decreases were partially offset by increased exposure to the Utilities, Global Commercial Banks, and Telecommunications Services industry sectors. Industry limits are used internally to manage industry concentrations and are based on committed exposure that is allocated on an industry-by-industry basis. A risk management framework is in place to set and approve industry limits as well as to provide ongoing monitoring. The Management Risk Committee oversees industry limit governance. Asset Managers and Funds, our largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $104.8 billion , decreased $3.0 billion , or three percent , during the three months ended March 31, 2019 . The change reflects a decrease in exposure to several counterparties. Real Estate, our second largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $87.5 billion , increased $1.0 billion , or one percent , during the three months ended March 31, 2019 . For more information on the commercial real estate and related portfolios, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Commercial Real Estate on page 31 . Capital Goods, our third largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $73.7 billion , decreased $1.4 billion , or two percent , during the three months ended March 31, 2019 . The decrease in committed exposure occurred primarily as a result of decreases in large conglomerates and aerospace and defense companies, partially offset by increases in trading companies and distributors.

For purposes of this table, the real estate industry is defined based on the primary business activity of the borrowers or counterparties using operating cash flows and primary source of repayment as key factors. (4) Represents net notional credit protection purchased. For additional information, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Risk Mitigation . Risk Mitigation We purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. To lower the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, we may add credit exposure within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, was $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion . We recorded net losses on these positions of $65 million and $9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 . The gains and losses on these instruments were offset by gains and losses on the related exposures. The Value-at-Risk (VaR) results for these exposures are included in the fair value option portfolio information in Table 41 . For additional information, see Trading Risk Management on page 37 .

Non-U.S. Portfolio Our non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios are subject to country risk. We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in government policies. A risk management framework is in place to measure, monitor and manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. In addition to the direct risk of doing business in a country, we also are exposed to indirect country risks (e.g., related to the collateral received on secured financing transactions or related to client clearing activities). These indirect exposures are managed in the normal course of business through credit, market and operational risk governance, rather than through country risk governance. Table 38 presents our 20 largest non-U.S. country exposures at March 31, 2019 . These exposures accounted for 89 percent of our total non-U.S. exposure at both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . Net country exposure for these 20 countries increased $4.9 billion in the three months ended March 31, 2019 , primarily driven by increased corporate exposure across multiple countries. Non-U.S. exposure is presented on an internal risk management basis and includes sovereign and non-sovereign credit exposure, securities and other investments issued by or domiciled in countries other than the U.S. Funded loans and loan equivalents include loans, leases, and other extensions of credit and funds, including letters of credit and due from placements. Unfunded commitments are the undrawn portion of legally binding commitments related to loans and loan equivalents. Net counterparty exposure includes the fair value of derivatives, including the counterparty risk associated with credit default swaps, and secured financing transactions. Securities and other investments are carried at fair value and long securities exposures are netted against short exposures with the same underlying issuer to, but not below, zero. Net country exposure represents country exposure less hedges and credit default protection purchased, net of credit default protection sold.

Our largest emerging market country exposure at March 31, 2019 was China, with net exposure of $14.2 billion , concentrated in large state-owned companies, subsidiaries of multinational corporations and commercial banks. The outlook for policy direction and therefore economic performance in the EU remains uncertain as a consequence of reduced political cohesion among EU countries. Additionally, we believe that the uncertainty in the U.K. ability to negotiate a favorable exit from the EU will further weigh on economic performance. For additional information, see Executive Summary Bank of America 34 Recent Developments U.K. Exit from the EU on page 3 . Our largest EU country exposure at March 31, 2019 was the U.K. with net exposure of $53.7 billion , which represents a $1.1 billion decrease from December 31, 2018 , primarily driven by a reduction in corporate exposure. We continue to closely monitor our exposures to tariff-sensitive industries and our international exposure, particularly to countries that account for a large percentage of U.S. trade, in light of ongoing trade tensions. Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses increased $179 million to $1.0 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 . The provision for credit losses was $22 million higher than net charge-offs for the three months ended March 31, 2019 , resulting in an increase in the allowance for credit losses. This compared to a reduction of $77 million in the allowance for credit losses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 . Net charge-offs for the three months ended March 31, 2019 were $991 million compared to $911 million for the same period in 2018. We expect net charge-offs for each of the remaining quarters in 2019 to approximate this quarter net charge-offs, assuming current economic conditions continue. The provision for credit losses for the consumer portfolio increased $82 million to $830 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 . The increase was primarily driven by a slower pace of portfolio improvement in the consumer real estate portfolio, and seasoning in the U.S. credit card portfolio. The provision for credit losses for the commercial portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, increased $97 million to $183 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 . The increase was primarily driven by a single-name utility client charge-off and energy reserve releases in the prior-year period. Allowance for Credit Losses Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses The allowance for loan and lease losses is comprised of two components. The first component covers nonperforming commercial loans and TDRs. The second component covers loans and leases on which there are incurred losses that are not yet individually identifiable, as well as incurred losses that may not be represented in the loss forecast models, which includes both quantitative and qualitative factors. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses based on the total of these two components. The allowance for loan and lease losses excludes loans held-for-sale (LHFS) and loans accounted for under the fair value option as the fair value reflects a credit risk component. For more information on the allowance for loan and lease losses, see Allowance for Credit Losses in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . During the three months ended March 31, 2019 , the factors that impacted the allowance for loan and lease losses included improvement in the credit quality of the consumer real estate portfolios driven by continuing improvements in the U.S. economy and strong labor markets, proactive credit risk management initiatives and the impact of high credit quality originations. Evidencing the improvements in the U.S. economy and strong labor markets are low levels of unemployment and increases in home prices. In addition to these improvements, in the consumer portfolio, nonperforming consumer loans decreased $264 million during the three months ended March 31, 2019 as returns to performing status, paydowns, charge-offs and loan sales continued to outpace new nonaccrual loans. The allowance for loan and lease losses for the consumer portfolio, as presented in Table 40 , was $4.8 billion at March 31, 2019 , a decrease of $46 million from December 31, 2018 . The decrease was primarily in the consumer real estate portfolio, partially offset by an increase in the U.S. credit card portfolio. The reduction in the allowance for the consumer real estate portfolio was due to improved home prices, lower nonperforming loans and a decrease in loan balances in our non-core portfolio. The increase in the allowance for the U.S. credit card portfolio was driven by portfolio seasoning. The allowance for loan and lease losses for the commercial portfolio, as presented in Table 40 , was $4.8 billion at March 31, 2019 , an increase of $22 million from December 31, 2018 . Commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure increased to $11.8 billion at March 31, 2019 from $11.1 billion (to 2.22 percent from 2.08 percent of total commercial reservable utilized exposure) at December 31, 2018 , and nonperforming commercial loans increased to $1.3 billion at March 31, 2019 from $1.1 billion (to 0.26 percent from 0.22 percent of outstanding commercial loans excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option) at December 31, 2018 with the increases spread across multiple industries. See Tables 29 , 30 and 31 for more details on key commercial credit statistics. The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding was 1.02 percent at both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we also estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments such as letters of credit, financial guarantees, unfunded bankers acceptances and binding loan commitments, excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value option. For more information on the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, see Allowance for Credit Losses in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . The reserve for unfunded lending commitments was $802 million at March 31, 2019 compared to $797 million at December 31, 2018 . 35 Bank of America Table 39 presents a rollforward of the allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 .

Trading Risk Management To evaluate risk in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of revenues generated by individual positions as well as portfolios of positions. VaR is a common statistic used to measure market risk as it allows the aggregation of market risk factors, including the effects of portfolio diversification. A VaR model simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR represents the loss a portfolio is not expected to exceed more than a certain number of times per period, based on a specified holding period, confidence level and window of historical data. We use one VaR model consistently across the trading portfolios, and it uses a historical simulation approach based on a three-year window of historical data. Our primary VaR statistic is equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level. This means that for a VaR with a one-day holding period, there should not be losses in excess of VaR, on average, 99 out of 100 trading days. For more information on our trading risk management process, see Trading Risk Management in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Table 41 presents the total market-based portfolio VaR which is the combination of the total covered positions (and less liquid trading positions) portfolio and the fair value option portfolio. For more information on the market risk VaR trading activities, see Trading Risk Management in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . The total market-based portfolio VaR results in Table 41 include market risk to which we are exposed from all business segments, excluding credit valuation adjustment (CVA), DVA and related hedges. The majority of this portfolio is within the Global Markets segment. Table 41 presents period-end, average, high and low daily trading VaR for the three months ended March 31, 2019 , December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2018 using a 99 percent confidence level. The amounts disclosed in Table 41 and Table 42 align to the view of covered positions used in the Basel 3 capital calculations. Foreign exchange and commodity positions are always considered covered positions, regardless of trading or banking treatment for the trade, except for structural foreign currency positions that are excluded with prior regulatory approval. The average total covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio VaR increased modestly for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the previous quarter primarily due to a decrease in portfolio diversification from changes in the equity risk profile in the portfolio. 37 Bank of America Table 41 Market Risk VaR for Trading Activities Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 March 31, 2018 (Dollars in millions) Period End Average High (1) Low (1) Period End Average High (1) Low (1) Period End Average High (1) Low (1) Foreign exchange $ 8 $ 6 $ 10 $ 4 $ 9 $ 7 $ 13 $ 3 $ 8 $ 8 $ 12 $ 6 Interest rate 38 28 49 17 36 28 45 18 33 23 33 18 Credit 21 21 26 18 26 25 29 23 28 27 31 23 Equity 26 19 26 14 20 25 40 15 16 19 28 14 Commodities 5 7 13 4 13 9 15 6 10 6 12 3 Portfolio diversification (61 ) (48 ) (59 ) (60 ) (57 ) (49 ) Total covered positions portfolio 37 33 47 25 45 34 45 26 38 34 43 25 Impact from less liquid exposures 4 4 5 2 4 6 Total covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio 41 37 53 28 50 36 51 26 42 40 51 29 Fair value option loans 7 8 10 7 8 9 12 8 12 10 12 8 Fair value option hedges 4 10 17 4 5 6 7 4 9 8 10 6 Fair value option portfolio diversification (6 ) (9 ) (7 ) (9 ) (11 ) (9 ) Total fair value option portfolio 5 9 16 5 6 6 8 5 10 9 10 7 Portfolio diversification (4 ) (6 ) (3 ) (4 ) (3 ) (4 ) Total market-based portfolio $ 42 $ 40 56 30 $ 53 $ 38 54 28 $ 49 $ 45 57 33 (1) The high and low for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the high and low for the components. Therefore the impact from less liquid exposures and the amount of portfolio diversification, which is the difference between the total portfolio and the sum of the individual components, is not relevant. The graph below presents the daily covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio VaR for the previous five quarters, corresponding to the data in Table 41 . Additional VaR statistics produced within our single VaR model are provided in Table 42 at the same level of detail as in Table 41 . Evaluating VaR with additional statistics allows for an increased understanding of the risks in the portfolio as the historical market data used in the VaR calculation does not necessarily follow a predefined statistical distribution. Table 42 presents average trading VaR statistics at 99 percent and 95 percent confidence levels for the three months ended March 31, 2019 , December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2018 .

A backtesting excess occurs when a trading loss exceeds the VaR for the corresponding day. These excesses are evaluated to understand the positions and market moves that produced the trading loss with a goal of ensuring that the VaR methodology accurately represents those losses. For more information on our backtesting process, see Trading Risk Management Backtesting in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. During the three months ended March 31, 2019 , there were no days in which there was a backtesting excess for our total covered portfolio VaR, utilizing a one-day holding period. Total Trading-related Revenue Total trading-related revenue, excluding brokerage fees, and CVA, DVA and funding valuation adjustment gains (losses), represents the total amount earned from trading positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. Trading account assets and liabilities are reported at fair value. For more information on fair value, see Note 20 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Trading-related revenue can be volatile and is largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand. Also, trading-related revenue is dependent on the volume and type of transactions, the level of risk assumed, and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the ever-changing market environment. Significant daily revenue by business is monitored and the primary drivers of these are reviewed. The following histogram is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2018 . During the three months ended March 31, 2019 , positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 100 percent of the trading days, of which 89 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million. This compares to the three months ended December 31, 2018 where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 95 percent of the trading days, of which 53 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million. Trading Portfolio Stress Testing Because the very nature of a VaR model suggests results can exceed our estimates and it is dependent on a limited historical window, we also stress test our portfolio using scenario analysis. This analysis estimates the change in the value of our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements. For additional information, see Trading Risk Management Trading Portfolio Stress Testing in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book The following discussion presents net interest income for banking book activities. Interest rate risk represents the most significant market risk exposure to our banking book balance sheet. Interest rate risk is measured as the potential change in net interest income caused by movements in market interest rates. Client-facing activities, primarily lending and deposit-taking, create interest rate sensitive positions on our balance sheet. We prepare forward-looking forecasts of net interest income. The baseline forecast takes into consideration expected future business growth, ALM positioning and the direction of interest rate movements as implied by the market-based forward curve. We then measure and evaluate the impact that alternative interest rate scenarios have on the baseline forecast in order to assess interest rate sensitivity under varied conditions. The net interest income forecast is frequently updated for changing assumptions and differing outlooks based on economic trends, market 39 Bank of America conditions and business strategies. Thus, we continually monitor our balance sheet position in order to maintain an acceptable level of exposure to interest rate changes. The interest rate scenarios that we analyze incorporate balance sheet assumptions such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, changes in funding mix, product repricing, maturity characteristics and investment securities premium amortization. Our overall goal is to manage interest rate risk so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital. Table 43 presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . Table 43 Forward Rates March 31, 2019 Federal Funds Three-month LIBOR 10-Year Swap Spot rates 2.50 % 2.60 % 2.41 % 12-month forward rates 2.25 2.31 2.43 December 31, 2018 Spot rates 2.50 % 2.81 % 2.71 % 12-month forward rates 2.50 2.64 2.75 Table 44 shows the pretax impact to forecasted net interest income over the next 12 months from March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , resulting from instantaneous parallel and non-parallel shocks to the market-based forward curve. Periodically we evaluate the scenarios presented so that they are meaningful in the context of the current rate environment. In the three months ended March 31, 2019 , the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet to rising rates increased primarily due to decreases in interest rates. We continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel move in interest rates with the majority of that impact coming from the short end of the yield curve. Additionally, higher interest rates impact the fair value of debt securities and, accordingly, for debt securities classified as AFS, may adversely affect accumulated OCI and thus capital levels under the Basel 3 capital rules. Under instantaneous upward parallel shifts, the near-term adverse impact to Basel 3 capital is reduced over time by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income.

Table 44 Estimated Banking Book Net Interest Income Sensitivity to Curve Changes Short Rate (bps) Long Rate (bps) March 31 2019 December 31 2018 (Dollars in millions) Parallel Shifts +100 bps instantaneous shift +100 +100 $ 3,673 $ 2,833 -100 bps instantaneous shift -100 -100 (5,285 ) (4,280 ) Flatteners Short-end instantaneous change +100 2,652 2,158 Long-end instantaneous change -100 (2,243 ) (1,618 ) Steepeners Short-end instantaneous change -100 (3,019 ) (2,648 ) Long-end instantaneous change +100 1,026 675 The sensitivity analysis in Table 44 assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates. As part of our ALM activities, we use securities, certain residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity. The behavior of our deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income. The sensitivity analysis in Table 44 assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce our benefit in those scenarios. Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative Contracts Interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts are utilized in our ALM activities and serve as an efficient tool to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk. We use derivatives to hedge the variability in cash flows or changes in fair value on our balance sheet due to interest rate and foreign exchange components. For more information on our hedging activities, see Note 3 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . For more information on interest rate contracts and risk management, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . We use interest rate derivative instruments to hedge the variability in the cash flows of our assets and liabilities and other forecasted transactions (collectively referred to as cash flow hedges). The net losses on both open and terminated cash flow hedge derivative instruments recorded in accumulated OCI were $1.0 billion and $1.3 billion , on a pretax basis, at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . These net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the same period as the hedged cash flows affect earnings and will decrease income or increase expense on the respective hedged cash flows. Assuming no change in open cash flow derivative hedge positions and no changes in prices or interest rates beyond what is implied in forward yield curves at March 31, 2019 , the pretax net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings as follows: 25 percent within the next year, 53 percent in years two through five and 12 percent in years six through ten, with the remaining 10 percent thereafter. For more information on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, see Note 3 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . We hedge our net investment in non-U.S. operations determined to have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar using forward foreign exchange contracts that typically settle in less than 180 days, cross-currency basis swaps and foreign exchange options. We recorded net after-tax losses on derivatives in accumulated OCI associated with net investment hedges which were offset by gains on our net investments in consolidated non-U.S. entities at March 31, 2019 . Table 45 presents derivatives utilized in our ALM activities and shows the notional amount, fair value, weighted-average receive-fixed and pay-fixed rates, expected maturity and average estimated durations of our open ALM derivatives at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . These amounts do not include derivative hedges on our MSRs. During the three months ended March 31, 2019 , the fair value of receive-fixed interest rate swaps increased while pay-fixed interest rates swaps decreased, driven by lower swap rates.

Foreign exchange contracts of $(8.4) billion at December 31, 2018 were comprised of $25.2 billion in foreign currency-denominated and cross-currency receive-fixed swaps, $(32.7) billion in net foreign currency forward rate contracts, $(1.8) billion in foreign currency-denominated pay-fixed swaps and $814 million in foreign currency futures contracts. (6) Reflects the net of long and short positions. Amounts shown as negative reflect a net short position. Mortgage Banking Risk Management We originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. We determine whether loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate. Interest rate risk and market risk can be substantial in the mortgage business. Changes in interest rates and other market factors impact the volume of mortgage originations. Changes in interest rates also impact the value of interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and the related residential first mortgage LHFS between the date of the IRLC and the date the loans are sold to the secondary market. An increase in mortgage interest rates typically leads to a decrease in the value of these instruments. Conversely, when there is an increase in interest rates, the value of the MSRs will increase driven by lower prepayment expectations. Because the interest rate risks of these two hedged items offset, we combine them into one overall hedged item with one combined economic hedge portfolio consisting of derivative contracts and securities. During the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 , we recorded gains of $61 million and $69 million related to the change in fair value of the MSRs, IRLCs and LHFS, net of gains and losses on the hedge portfolio. For more information on MSRs, see Note 15 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements . 41 Bank of America Complex Accounting Estimates Our significant accounting principles are essential in understanding the MD&A. Many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments.
