Recent Developments Capital Management Following completion of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) 2019 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), the Federal Reserve did not object to the Corporation capital plan, which is estimated to return $37 billion to common shareholders over the next four quarters through quarterly common stock dividends and common stock repurchases. As part of the capital plan, on July 25, 2019, the Corporation Board of Directors (the Board) declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.18 per share, an increase of 20 percent, payable on September 27, 2019 to shareholders of record as of September 6, 2019. Also, on June 27, 2019, the Board authorized the repurchase of approximately $30.9 billion in common stock from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020, which includes approximately $900 million in repurchases to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans during the same period. For additional information, see the Corporation Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on June 27, 2019. Merchant Services Joint Venture As previously disclosed in the Corporation Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2019, a significant portion of the Corporation merchant processing activity is performed by a joint venture, formed in 2009, in which the Corporation owns a 49 percent ownership interest. In June 2019, the joint venture partners agreed to extend the Corporation right to terminate the joint venture at the end of its current term, which is June 2020, from one year to four months prior to that date. On July 29, 2019, the Corporation gave notice to the joint venture partner of the termination of the joint venture upon the conclusion of its current term, after which the Corporation expects to pursue its own merchant services strategy. In addition, the Corporation and the joint venture partner have an agreement to provide uninterrupted delivery of products and services to the joint venture merchants through at least June 2023. As a result of the above actions, the Corporation expects to incur a non-cash, pretax impairment charge of approximately $1.7 billion to $2.1 billion in the third quarter of 2019, which is estimated to reduce the Common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio by 9 to 11 basis points (bps). The impairment charge will have no effect on the Corporation capital plan as described in Recent Developments Capital Management above. For additional information, see Note 11 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements . U.K. Exit from the EU In April 2019, the deadline for the U.K. withdrawal from the EU was extended to October 31, 2019; however, the U.K. withdrawal could occur sooner if a withdrawal agreement is reached prior to the deadline or could be extended beyond that date. Negotiations between the U.K. and the EU regarding the terms and conditions of the withdrawal are ongoing. We conduct business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa primarily through our subsidiaries in the U.K., Ireland and France. For information on the changes we have implemented to enable us to continue to operate in the region, including establishing a bank and broker-dealer in the EU, see the Corporation Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2019. While we have taken measures to minimize operational disruption and prepare for various potential outcomes of the U.K. withdrawal from the EU, the preparedness of our counterparties and the relevant financial markets infrastructure remain outside our control. The global economic impact of the U.K. withdrawal from the EU remains uncertain and could result in regional and global financial market disruptions. In preparation for the withdrawal, we will continue to assess potential risks, including operational, regulatory and legal risks. LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rates Following the announcement by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority in July 2017 that it will no longer persuade or require banks to submit rates for the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) after 2021, central banks and regulators around the world have commissioned working groups to find suitable replacements for Interbank Offered Rates (IBOR) and other benchmark rates and to implement financial benchmark reforms more generally. These actions have resulted in uncertainty regarding the use of alternative reference rates (ARRs) and could cause disruptions in a variety of markets, as well as adversely impact our business, operations and financial results. To facilitate an orderly transition from IBORs and other benchmark rates to ARRs, the Corporation has established an enterprise-wide initiative led by senior management. The objective of this initiative is to identify, assess and monitor risks associated with the expected discontinuation or unavailability of benchmarks, including LIBOR, achieve operational readiness and engage impacted clients in connection with the transition to ARRs. The Corporation also continues to actively work with global regulators, 3 Bank of America industry working groups and trade associations to develop strategies for an effective transition to ARRs. As a part of its initiative, the Corporation is modifying systems, procedures and internal infrastructure to transition to ARRs. For example, the Corporation launched capabilities to support issuance and trading in products indexed to the new Secured Overnight Financing Rate, which is the alternative benchmark rate to U.S. dollar LIBOR recommended by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a group of private-market participants convened by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. For more information on the expected replacement of LIBOR and other benchmark rates, see Item 1A.

Financial Highlights Table 1 Summary Income Statement and Selected Financial Data Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 (Dollars in millions, except per share information) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Income statement Net interest income $ 12,189 $ 11,828 $ 24,564 $ 23,597 Noninterest income 10,895 10,721 21,524 22,022 Total revenue, net of interest expense 23,084 22,549 46,088 45,619 Provision for credit losses 857 827 1,870 1,661 Noninterest expense 13,268 13,224 26,492 27,066 Income before income taxes 8,959 8,498 17,726 16,892 Income tax expense 1,611 1,714 3,067 3,190 Net income 7,348 6,784 14,659 13,702 Preferred stock dividends 239 318 681 746 Net income applicable to common shareholders $ 7,109 $ 6,466 $ 13,978 $ 12,956 Per common share information Earnings $ 0.75 $ 0.64 $ 1.45 $ 1.26 Diluted earnings 0.74 0.63 1.45 1.25 Dividends paid 0.15 0.12 0.30 0.24 Performance ratios Return on average assets 1.23 % 1.17 % 1.24 % 1.19 % Return on average common shareholders equity 11.62 10.75 11.52 10.80 Return on average tangible common shareholders equity (1) 16.24 15.15 16.13 15.21 Efficiency ratio 57.48 58.65 57.48 59.33 June 30 2019 December 31 2018 Balance sheet Total loans and leases $ 963,800 $ 946,895 Total assets 2,395,892 2,354,507 Total deposits 1,375,093 1,381,476 Total liabilities 2,124,484 2,089,182 Total common shareholders equity 246,719 242,999 Total shareholders equity 271,408 265,325 (1) Return on average tangible common shareholders equity is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information and a corresponding reconciliation to the most closely related financial measures defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 48 . Net income was $7.3 billion and $14.7 billion , or $0.74 and $1.45 per diluted share, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to $6.8 billion and $13.7 billion , or $0.63 and $1.25 per diluted share, for the same periods in 2018 . The improvement in net income for the three months ended June 30, 2019 was driven by an increase in net interest income and noninterest income partially offset by an increase in provision for credit losses and higher noninterest expense. The improvement in net income for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was due to higher net interest income as well as lower noninterest expense, partially offset by higher provision for credit losses and lower noninterest income. Total assets increased $41.4 billion from December 31, 2018 to $2.4 trillion primarily driven by higher trading account assets in Global Markets due to increased client balances in Equities and increased levels of inventory in Fixed-Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC) to facilitate expected client demand, higher loans and leases primarily due to continued commercial loan and residential mortgage growth, and an increase in other assets partially offset by lower federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell and lower customer and other receivables. Total liabilities increased $35.3 billion from December 31, 2018 to $2.1 trillion driven by higher trading account liabilities in FICC to facilitate expected client demand, an increase in long-term debt due to valuation adjustments, an increase in federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase driven by funding needs in the Equities businesses within Global Markets and an increase in other short-term borrowings as a result of higher Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances. Shareholders equity increased $6.1 billion from December 31, 2018 primarily due to net income, market value increases on debt securities and issuances of preferred stock partially offset by returns of capital to shareholders through common stock repurchases and common and preferred stock dividends. Bank of America 4 Net Interest Income Net interest income increased $361 million to $12.2 billion , and $967 million to $24.6 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018. Net interest yield on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis increased 3 bps to 2.44 percent , and 6 bps to 2.48 percent for the same periods. The increase for the three-month period was primarily driven by higher short-term interest rates, and for both periods, loan and deposit growth. Both long- and short-term interest rates have declined over the first half of 2019. We still expect net interest income for 2019 to grow as compared to 2018. If interest rates and other economic conditions remain stable with those of July 17, 2019, when we announced our second quarter 2019 results, net interest income is expected to grow approximately two percent. If, instead, short-term interest rates were to be lower as projected by the forward interest rate curve as a result of two implied Fed Funds rate cuts of 25 bps each this year, net interest income would be expected to grow approximately one percent. For more information on net interest yield and the FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 6 , and for more information on interest rate risk management, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 45 . Noninterest Income Table 2 Noninterest Income Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Fees and commissions: Card income $ 1,446 $ 1,483 $ 2,821 $ 2,885 Service charges 1,903 1,954 3,742 3,875 Investment and brokerage services 3,470 3,458 6,830 7,122 Investment banking fees 1,371 1,422 2,635 2,775 Total fees and commissions 8,190 8,317 16,028 16,657 Trading account income 2,345 2,151 4,683 4,704 Other income 360 253 813 661 Total noninterest income $ 10,895 $ 10,721 $ 21,524 $ 22,022 Noninterest income increased $174 million to $10.9 billion , and decreased $498 million to $21.5 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018. The following highlights the significant changes. Service charges decreased $51 million and $133 million primarily driven by lower fees due to policy changes in Consumer, lower treasury fees in Global Banking in both periods, and lower ATM volume in the six-month period. Investment and brokerage services income increased modestly for the three-month period and decreased $292 million for the six-month period. The decline was primarily due to lower average market valuations compared to the same period in 2018 and declines in transactional revenue and assets under management (AUM) pricing, partially offset by the positive impact of AUM flows. The decline in transactional revenue for the six-month period was driven by lower market volatility resulting in lower client activity. Investment banking fees decreased $51 million for the three-month period due to declines in debt underwriting and advisory fees, partially offset by higher equity underwriting fees. The $140 million decrease for the six-month period was due to declines in debt underwriting fees, partially offset by increases in advisory fees and equity underwriting fees. Trading account income increased $194 million for the three-month period primarily driven by lower interest rates, partially offset by weakness in foreign exchange and equity derivatives trading. Other income increased $107 million and $152 million primarily due to an increase in both periods in equity investment income and gains on sales of debt securities. Also, the second quarter of the prior year included a $729 million charge related to the redemption of certain trust preferred securities, partially offset by a $572 million gain from the sale of certain non-core mortgage loans. Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses increased $30 million to $857 million , and $209 million to $1.9 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018. The increases were primarily driven by energy reserve releases in the prior-year periods and portfolio seasoning in the U.S. credit card portfolio, partially offset by the impact of recoveries recorded in connection with sales of previously charged-off non-core home equity loans. The increase in the six-month period also included a single-name utility client charge-off. For more information on the provision for credit losses, see Provision for Credit Losses on page 41 . Noninterest Expense Table 3 Noninterest Expense Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Compensation and benefits $ 7,972 $ 7,944 $ 16,221 $ 16,424 Occupancy and equipment 1,640 1,591 3,245 3,198 Information processing and communications 1,157 1,121 2,321 2,286 Product delivery and transaction related 709 706 1,371 1,462 Marketing 528 395 970 740 Professional fees 409 399 769 780 Other general operating 853 1,068 1,595 2,176 Total noninterest expense $ 13,268 $ 13,224 $ 26,492 $ 27,066 5 Bank of America Noninterest expense increased $44 million to $13.3 billion , and decreased $574 million to $26.5 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018. The decrease in the six-month period was primarily due to efficiency savings, lower Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) expense and lower amortization of intangibles expense, partially offset by increased costs associated with investments in the businesses, including brand-related marketing costs. Income Tax Expense Table 4 Income Tax Expense Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Income before income taxes $ 8,959 $ 8,498 $ 17,726 $ 16,892 Income tax expense 1,611 1,714 3,067 3,190 Effective tax rate 18.0 % 20.2 % 17.3 % 18.9 % The effective tax rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 reflect the impact of our recurring tax preference benefits and certain discrete tax items, primarily tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in the six-month effective rates. We expect the effective tax rate for the rest of 2019 to be approximately 19 percent, absent unusual items. Supplemental Financial Data In this Form 10-Q, we present certain non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items or otherwise include components that differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional useful information to assess our financial condition, results of operations (including period-to-period operating performance) or compliance with prospective regulatory requirements. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same way as non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. We view net interest income and related ratios and analyses on an FTE basis, which when presented on a consolidated basis are non-GAAP financial measures. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 21 percent and a representative state tax rate. Net interest yield, which measures the basis points we earn over the cost of funds, utilizes net interest income (and thus total revenue) on an FTE basis. We believe that presentation of these items on an FTE basis allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practices. We may present certain key performance indicators and ratios excluding certain items (e.g., debit valuation adjustment (DVA) gains (losses)) which result in non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the presentation of measures that exclude these items is useful because such measures provide additional information to assess the underlying operational performance and trends of our businesses and to allow better comparison of period-to-period operating performance. We also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents an adjusted shareholders equity or common shareholders equity amount which has been reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)), net of related deferred tax liabilities. These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models use both return on average tangible common shareholders equity and return on average tangible shareholders equity as key measures to support our overall growth goals. These ratios are as follows: Return on average tangible common shareholders equity measures our net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average common shareholders equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders equity divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on average tangible shareholders equity measures our net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders equity divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders equity divided by ending common shares outstanding. We believe that the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. Tangible book value per common share provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation to outstanding shares of common stock.

Bank of America 10 Business Segment Operations Segment Description and Basis of Presentation We report our results of operations through the following four business segments: Consumer Banking, GWIM, Global Banking and Global Markets , with the remaining operations recorded in All Other . We manage our segments and report their results on an FTE basis. We periodically review capital allocated to our businesses and allocate capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. We utilize a methodology that considers the effect of regulatory capital requirements in addition to internal risk-based capital models. Our internal risk-based capital models use a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment credit, market, interest rate, business and operational risk components. For more information on the nature of these risks, see Managing Risk on page 22 . The capital allocated to the business segments is referred to as allocated capital. Allocated equity in the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting unit. For more information, see Note 8 Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements . For more information on our presentation of financial information on an FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 6 , and for reconciliations to consolidated total revenue, net income and period-end total assets, see Note 18 Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements .

Consumer Banking, which is comprised of Deposits and Consumer Lending, offers a diversified range of credit, banking and investment products and services to consumers and small businesses. For more information about Consumer Banking , including our Deposits and Consumer Lending businesses, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Consumer Banking Results Three-Month Comparison Net income for Consumer Banking increased $372 million to $3.3 billion primarily driven by higher net interest income which increased $523 million to $7.1 billion primarily due to growth in deposits and loans as well as the impact of higher short-term interest rates. Noninterest income decreased $39 million to $2.6 billion driven by lower card income, service charges and mortgage banking income, partially offset by the results from asset and liability management (ALM) activities. Noninterest expense increased $40 million to $4.4 billion primarily driven by continued investments in the business, including marketing, and increases in primary sales professionals combined with investments in new and renovated financial centers, and digital capabilities. These increases were largely offset by lower FDIC expense and operating efficiencies. The return on average allocated capital was 36 percent, up from 32 percent, driven by higher net income. For additional information on capital allocations, see Business Segment Operations on page 11 . Six-Month Comparison Net income for Consumer Banking increased $1.0 billion to $6.5 billion primarily driven by an increase in net interest income and lower noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $1.2 billion to $14.2 billion and noninterest income decreased $17 million to $5.1 billion . These were primarily driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion. The provision for credit losses increased $42 million to $1.9 billion due to portfolio seasoning in the U.S. credit card portfolio. Noninterest expense decreased $152 million to $8.8 billion primarily driven by lower FDIC expense and operating efficiencies. These decreases were partially offset by continued investments in the business. The return on average allocated capital was 36 percent, up from 30 percent, driven by higher net income. Deposits Three-Month Comparison Net income for Deposits increased $362 million to $2.2 billion driven by higher revenue. Net interest income increased $468 million to $4.4 billion primarily due to growth in deposits and loans, and pricing discipline. Noninterest income of $1.2 billion remained relatively unchanged as lower service charges were largely offset by the results from ALM activities. Noninterest expense increased $19 million to $2.7 billion primarily driven by continued investments in the business, largely offset by lower FDIC expense and operating efficiencies. Bank of America 12 Average deposits increased $19.6 billion to $701.8 billion driven by strong organic growth. Growth in checking and time deposits of $24.0 billion was partially offset by a decline in traditional savings and money market savings of $4.2 billion. Six-Month Comparison Net income for Deposits increased $950 million to $4.4 billion driven by higher revenue and lower noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $1.1 billion to $8.7 billion primarily driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion. Noninterest income increased $73 million to $2.5 billion primarily driven by the results from ALM activities, partially offset by lower service charges. Noninterest expense decreased $64 million to $5.3 billion primarily driven by lower FDIC expense and operating efficiencies, partially offset by continued investments in the business. Average deposits increased $21.4 billion to $697.0 billion driven by strong organic growth. Growth in checking and money market savings of $23.9 billion was partially offset by a decline in traditional savings and time deposits of $2.3 billion.

For more information about Global Banking , see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Three-Month Comparison Net income for Global Banking decreased $185 million to $1.9 billion primarily driven by higher provision for credit losses. Revenue decreased $39 million to $5.0 billion driven by modest declines in net interest income and noninterest income. Net interest income decreased $30 million to $2.7 billion as the impact of deposit and loan growth was more than offset by the allocation of ALM activities and loan spread compression. Noninterest income decreased $9 million to $2.3 billion . The provision for credit losses increased $148 million to $125 million primarily driven by energy reserve releases in the prior-year period. Noninterest expense increased $27 million to $2.2 billion primarily due to continued investment in the business. The return on average allocated capital was 19 percent , down from 21 percent, due to lower net income.

Six-Month Comparison Net income for Global Banking decreased $145 million to $4.0 billion primarily driven by higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher revenue. Revenue increased $121 million to $10.1 billion driven by higher net interest income and noninterest income. Net interest income increased $81 million to $5.5 billion primarily due to the impact of higher deposit and loan balances and increased deposit rates, partially offset by the allocation of ALM activities and loan spread compression. Noninterest income increased $40 million to $4.6 billion primarily due to higher leasing-related revenue and ALM results, partially offset by lower fees and commissions. The provision for credit losses increased $243 million to $236 million primarily driven by energy reserve releases in the prior-year period and a current-period single-name utility client charge-off. Noninterest expense was relatively unchanged at $4.5 billion , primarily due to lower FDIC expense, largely offset by continued investment in the business. The return on average allocated capital was 19 percent , down from 20 percent, due to lower net income.

Global Transaction Services revenue increased $135 million and $333 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 primarily driven by higher deposit balances and rates. Average loans and leases increased five percent for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 driven by growth in the commercial and industrial portfolio. Average deposits increased 12 percent and 10 percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 due to growth in domestic and international interest-bearing balances. Global Investment Banking Client teams and product specialists underwrite and distribute debt, equity and loan products, and provide advisory services and tailored risk management solutions. The economics of certain investment banking and underwriting activities are shared primarily between Global Banking and Global Markets under an internal revenue-sharing arrangement. Global Banking originates certain deal-related transactions with our corporate and commercial clients that are executed and distributed by Global Markets . To provide a complete discussion of our consolidated investment banking fees, the following table presents total Corporation investment banking fees and the portion attributable to Global Banking.

Global Markets product coverage includes securities and derivative products in both the primary and secondary markets. For more information about Global Markets, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Three-Month Comparison Net income for Global Markets decreased $83 million to $1.0 billion . Net DVA losses were $31 million compared to losses of $179 million , and excluding net DVA, net income decreased $195 million to $1.1 billion . These decreases were primarily driven by a decrease in revenue, partially offset by lower noninterest expense. Revenue declined $106 million to $4.1 billion due to lower sales and trading revenue and lower investment banking fees, partially offset by a $199 million gain on the sale of an equity investment. Sales and trading revenue decreased $209 million , and excluding net DVA, decreased $357 million due to declines in both FICC and Equities revenue. Noninterest expense decreased $49 million to $2.7 billion primarily driven by lower revenue-related expenses. Average total assets increased $6.9 billion to $685.4 billion driven by increased levels of inventory in FICC to facilitate expected client demand. The return on average allocated capital was 12 percent , down from 13 percent , reflecting lower net income. 19 Bank of America Six-Month Comparison Net income for Global Markets decreased $446 million to $2.1 billion . Net DVA losses were $121 million compared to losses of $115 million . Excluding net DVA, net income decreased $441 million to $2.2 billion , primarily driven by a decrease in revenue, partially offset by lower noninterest expense. Revenue declined $737 million to $8.3 billion . Sales and trading revenue decreased $894 million , and excluding net DVA, decreased $888 million , and noninterest expense decreased $219 million to $5.4 billion . These decreases were primarily driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion. Average total assets decreased $3.6 billion to $674.8 billion primarily due to lower client balances in Equities. Period-end total assets increased $33.1 billion from December 31, 2018 to $675.0 billion due to higher client balances in Equities and increased levels of inventory in FICC to facilitate expected client demand. The return on average allocated capital was 12 percent , down from 15 percent , reflecting lower net income. Sales and Trading Revenue For a description of sales and trading revenue, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . The following table and related discussion present sales and trading revenue, substantially all of which is in Global Markets, with the remainder in Global Banking . In addition, the following table and related discussion present sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information on net DVA, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 6 . Sales and Trading Revenue (1, 2) Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Sales and trading revenue Fixed-income, currencies and commodities $ 2,098 $ 2,132 $ 4,377 $ 4,765 Equities 1,144 1,319 2,325 2,831 Total sales and trading revenue $ 3,242 $ 3,451 $ 6,702 $ 7,596 Sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA (3) Fixed-income, currencies and commodities $ 2,128 $ 2,316 $ 4,486 $ 4,871 Equities 1,145 1,314 2,337 2,840 Total sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA $ 3,273 $ 3,630 $ 6,823 $ 7,711 (1) Includes FTE adjustments of $31 million and $80 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to $80 million and $146 million for the same periods in 2018 . For more information on sales and trading revenue, see Note 3 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . (2) Includes Global Banking sales and trading revenue of $128 million and $243 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to $79 million and $244 million for the same periods in 2018 . (3) FICC and Equities sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, is a non-GAAP financial measure. FICC net DVA losses were $30 million and $109 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to losses of $184 million and $106 million for the same periods in 2018 . Equities net DVA losses were $1 million and $12 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to gains of $5 million and losses of $9 million for the same periods in 2018 . The following explanations for period-over-period changes in sales and trading, FICC and Equities revenue exclude net DVA, but would be the same if net DVA was included. Three-Month Comparison FICC revenue decreased $188 million due to a generally weaker trading environment leading to reduced client activity across most products. Equities revenue decreased $169 million driven by under performance in derivatives compared to a strong prior-year period due to lower levels of client activity and weaker trading performance. Six-Month Comparison FICC revenue decreased $385 million and equities revenue decreased $503 million , both primarily driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion.

Average allocated assets were $549.5 billion and $543.0 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to $519.6 billion and $517.1 billion for the same periods in 2018, and period-end allocated assets were $544.0 billion and $540.8 billion at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . n/m = not meaningful All Other consists of ALM activities, equity investments, non-core mortgage loans and servicing activities, liquidating businesses and certain expenses not otherwise allocated to a business segment. ALM activities encompass certain residential mortgages, debt securities, and interest rate and foreign currency risk management activities. Substantially all of the results of ALM activities are allocated to our business segments . Equity investments include our merchant services joint venture, as well as a portfolio of equity, real estate and other alternative investments . For information on our merchant services joint venture, see Note 11 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements . For additional information about All Other, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . For more information on the composition of the core and non-core portfolios, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 28 . Residential mortgage loans that are held for ALM purposes, including interest rate or liquidity risk management, are classified as core and are presented on the balance sheet of All Other . During the six months ended June 30, 2019 , residential mortgage loans held for ALM activities decreased $1.1 billion to $23.8 billion primarily as a result of payoffs and paydowns. Non-core residential mortgage and home equity loans, which are principally runoff portfolios, are also held in All Other . During the six months ended June 30, 2019 , total non-core loans decreased $3.9 billion to $19.6 billion due primarily to payoffs and paydowns as well as sales and Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan conveyances, offset by repurchases. Three-Month Comparison Net income for All Other increased $358 million to $9 million driven by improved revenue, an increase in the benefit in provision for credit losses and a higher income tax benefit. Revenue increased $33 million from the prior period which included a $729 million charge related to the redemption of certain trust preferred securities and a $572 million gain from the sale of non-core mortgage loans. The benefit in the provision for credit losses increased $136 million to $241 million primarily due to recoveries from the sales of previously charged-off non-core home equity loans. The income tax benefit increased to $786 million driven by a higher level of tax credits. Both periods included income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking . Six-Month Comparison The net loss for All Other improved $305 million to a loss of $39 million driven by an increased income tax benefit, partially offset by a higher pretax loss. Revenue decreased $175 million to negative $1.1 billion with the same factors as described in the three-month discussion affecting the year-over-year results. The benefit in the provision for credit losses increased $38 million to $295 million primarily driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion, partially offset by a slower pace of portfolio improvement. Noninterest expense decreased $82 million to $933 million reflecting lower non-core mortgage costs, primarily due to lower volume, a decrease in compensation and benefits, and lower FDIC expense, partially offset by higher marketing expense. The income tax benefit was $1.7 billion compared to a benefit of $1.4 billion in the same period in 2018, driven by a higher level of tax credits. Both periods included income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking . Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have contractual obligations to make future payments on debt and lease agreements. Additionally, in the normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements whereby we commit to future purchases of products or services from unaffiliated parties. For more information on obligations and commitments, see Note 11 Commitments and Contingencies to 21 Bank of America the Consolidated Financial Statements herein, as well as Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K , and Note 11 Long-term Debt and Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Representations and Warranties Obligations For information on representations and warranties obligations in connection with the sale of mortgage loans, see Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . For more information related to the sensitivity of the assumptions used to estimate our reserve for representations and warranties, see Complex Accounting Estimates Representations and Warranties Liability in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Managing Risk Risk is inherent in all our business activities. The seven key types of risk faced by the Corporation are strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational. Sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver for our shareholders. If not managed well, risks can result in financial loss, regulatory sanctions and penalties, and damage to our reputation, each of which may adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategies. The Corporation takes a comprehensive approach to risk management with a defined Risk Framework and an articulated Risk Appetite Statement which are approved annually by the Enterprise Risk Committee and the Board. Our Risk Framework is the foundation for consistent and effective management of risks facing the Corporation. The Risk Framework sets forth clear roles, responsibilities and accountability for the management of risk and provides a blueprint for how the Board, through delegation of authority to committees and executive officers, establishes risk appetite and associated limits for our activities. Our Risk Appetite Statement is intended to ensure that the Corporation maintains an acceptable risk profile by providing a common framework and a comparable set of measures for senior management and the Board to clearly indicate the level of risk the Corporation is willing to accept. Risk appetite is set at least annually and is aligned with the Corporation strategic, capital and financial operating plans. Our line of business strategies and risk appetite are also similarly aligned. For more information on our Risk Framework, our risk management activities and the key types of risk faced by the Corporation, see the Managing Risk through Reputational Risk sections in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Capital Management The Corporation manages its capital position so that its capital is more than adequate to support its business activities and aligns with risk, risk appetite and strategic planning. For more information on capital management, including related regulatory requirements, see Capital Management in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . CCAR and Capital Planning The Federal Reserve requires BHCs to submit a capital plan and requests for capital actions on an annual basis, consistent with the rules governing the CCAR capital plan. On June 27, 2019, following the Federal Reserve non-objection to our 2019 CCAR capital plan, the Board authorized the repurchase of approximately $30.9 billion in common stock from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020, which includes approximately $900 million to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans during the same period. The Board common stock repurchase authorization replaces its prior common stock repurchase authorization that expired on June 30, 2019. Our stock repurchases are subject to various factors, including the Corporation capital position, liquidity, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock trading price and general market conditions, and may be suspended at any time. The repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including repurchase plans that satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). As a well-capitalized BHC, we may notify the Federal Reserve of our intention to make additional capital distributions not to exceed 0.25 percent of Tier 1 capital, and which were not contemplated in our capital plan, subject to the Federal Reserve non-objection. Regulatory Capital As a financial services holding company, we are subject to regulatory capital rules, including Basel 3, issued by U.S. banking regulators. The Corporation's depository institution subsidiaries are also subject to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. The Corporation and its primary affiliated banking entity, BANA, are Advanced approaches institutions under Basel 3 and are required to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and risk-weighted assets under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is used to assess capital adequacy including under the PCA framework. As of June 30, 2019 , the CET1 and Tier 1 capital ratios for the Corporation were lower under the Standardized approach whereas the Advanced approaches yielded a lower Total capital ratio. Minimum Capital Requirements Minimum capital requirements and related buffers were fully phased in as of January 1, 2019. In order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments, the Corporation must meet risk-based capital ratio requirements that include a capital conservation buffer greater than 2.5 percent, plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer and a global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge. The buffers and surcharge must be comprised solely of CET1 capital. The Corporation is also required to maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Our insured depository institution subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be considered well capitalized under the PCA framework. Capital Composition and Ratios Table 9 presents Bank of America Corporation capital ratios and related information in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced approaches as measured at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . As of the periods presented herein, the Corporation met the definition of well capitalized under current regulatory requirements. Bank of America 22 Table 9 Bank of America Corporation Regulatory Capital under Basel 3 Standardized Approach Advanced Approaches Regulatory Minimum (1) (Dollars in millions, except as noted) June 30, 2019 Risk-based capital metrics: Common equity tier 1 capital $ 171,498 $ 171,498 Tier 1 capital 195,539 195,539 Total capital (2) 228,965 220,904 Risk-weighted assets (in billions) 1,467 1,431 Common equity tier 1 capital ratio 11.7 % 12.0 % 9.5 % Tier 1 capital ratio 13.3 13.7 11.0 Total capital ratio 15.6 15.4 13.0 Leverage-based metrics: Adjusted quarterly average assets (in billions) (3) $ 2,322 $ 2,322 Tier 1 leverage ratio 8.4 % 8.4 % 4.0 SLR leverage exposure (in billions) $ 2,872 SLR 6.8 % 5.0 December 31, 2018 Risk-based capital metrics: Common equity tier 1 capital $ 167,272 $ 167,272 Tier 1 capital 189,038 189,038 Total capital (2) 221,304 212,878 Risk-weighted assets (in billions) 1,437 1,409 Common equity tier 1 capital ratio 11.6 % 11.9 % 8.25 % Tier 1 capital ratio 13.2 13.4 9.75 Total capital ratio 15.4 15.1 11.75 Leverage-based metrics: Adjusted quarterly average assets (in billions) (3) $ 2,258 $ 2,258 Tier 1 leverage ratio 8.4 % 8.4 % 4.0 SLR leverage exposure (in billions) $ 2,791 SLR 6.8 % 5.0 (1) The capital conservation buffer and G-SIB surcharge were both 2.5 percent at June 30, 2019 and 1.875 percent at December 31, 2018 . The countercyclical capital buffer for both periods was zero . The SLR minimum includes a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent. (2) Total capital under the Advanced approaches differs from the Standardized approach due to differences in the amount permitted in Tier 2 capital related to the qualifying allowance for credit losses. (3) Reflects total average assets adjusted for certain Tier 1 capital deductions. CET1 capital was $171.5 billion at June 30, 2019 , an increase of $4.2 billion from December 31, 2018 , driven by earnings and lower net unrealized losses on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities included in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI), partially offset by common stock repurchases and dividends. During the six months ended June 30, 2019 , Total capital under the Advanced approaches increased $8.0 billion primarily driven by the same factors as CET1 capital and preferred stock issuances. Risk-weighted assets under the Standardized approach, which yielded the lower CET1 capital ratio at June 30, 2019 , increased $ 29.3 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2019 to $1,467 billion primarily due to an increase in other assets and client activity in Global Markets and Global Banking . Table 10 shows the capital composition at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 .

The regulatory minimums for the leverage ratios as of both period ends and risk-based capital ratios as of December 31, 2018 are the percent required to be considered well capitalized under the PCA framework. (2) Total capital under the Advanced approaches differs from the Standardized approach due to differences in the amount permitted in Tier 2 capital related to the qualifying allowance for credit losses. (3) Reflects total average assets adjusted for certain Tier 1 capital deductions. Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity Requirements Effective January 1, 2019, the Corporation is subject to the Federal Reserve final rule requiring G-SIBs to maintain minimum levels of total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) and long-term debt. TLAC consists of the Corporation Tier 1 capital and eligible long-term debt issued directly by the Corporation. Eligible long-term debt for TLAC ratios is comprised of unsecured debt that has a remaining maturity of at least one year and satisfies additional requirements as prescribed in the TLAC final rule. As with the risk-based capital ratios and SLR, the Corporation is required to maintain TLAC ratios in excess of minimum requirements plus applicable buffers in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Table 13 presents the Corporation's TLAC and long-term debt ratios and related information as of June 30, 2019 . Bank of America 24 Table 13 Bank of America Corporation Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity and Long-Term Debt TLAC Regulatory Minimum (1) Long-term Debt Regulatory Minimum (2) (Dollars in millions, except ratios) June 30, 2019 Total eligible balance $ 373,680 $ 172,480 Percentage of risk-weighted assets (3) 25.5 % 22.0 % 11.8 % 8.5 % Percentage of SLR leverage exposure 13.0 9.5 6.0 4.5 (1) The TLAC risk-weighted assets regulatory minimum consists of 18.0 percent plus a TLAC risk-weighted assets buffer comprised of 2.5 percent plus the method 1 G-SIB surcharge of 1.5 percent. The countercyclical buffer is zero for this period. The TLAC SLR leverage exposure regulatory minimum consists of 7.5 percent plus a 2.0 percent TLAC leverage buffer. The TLAC risk-weighted assets and leverage buffers must be comprised solely of CET1 capital and Tier 1 capital, respectively. (2) The long-term debt risk-weighted assets regulatory minimum is comprised of 6.0 percent plus an additional 2.5 percent requirement based on the Corporation method 2 G-SIB surcharge. (3) The approach that yields the higher risk-weighted assets is used to calculate TLAC and long-term debt ratios, which was the Standardized approach as of June 30, 2019. Regulatory Developments The following supplements the disclosure in Capital Management Regulatory Developments in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Security-Based Swap Dealer Capital, Margin and Segregation Requirements On June 21, 2019, the SEC published a final rule establishing capital, margin and segregation requirements for security-based swap dealers (SBSDs). The final rule increases the minimum net capital requirements for broker-dealers authorized to use internal models to compute alternative net capital (ANC broker-dealers). For ANC broker-dealers, the minimum tentative net capital requirement increased from $1.0 billion to $5.0 billion, and the net capital requirement was raised to the greater of $1.0 billion or the applicable risk-margin amount (initial margin maintained for cleared and non-cleared security-based swaps) plus two percent of certain customer-related assets. For stand-alone SBSDs that use models to calculate haircuts, the minimum tentative net capital requirement is $100 million and the minimum net capital requirement is the greater of $20 million or two percent of the risk-margin amount. Revisions to Leverage Ratio Framework On June 26, 2019, the Basel Committee published a revised leverage ratio treatment of client-cleared derivatives, which aligns the leverage ratio measurement of client-cleared derivatives with the measurement determined according to the Standardized approach to measuring counterparty credit risk exposures, as used for risk-based capital requirements. U.S. banking regulators may update the U.S. Basel 3 rules to incorporate the Basel Committee revisions. The impact to the Corporation leverage ratio is not expected to be significant if U.S. banking regulators adopt the revisions as written by the Basel Committee. Broker-dealer Regulatory Capital and Securities Regulation The Corporation principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (MLPF&S), BofA Securities, Inc. (BofAS) and Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp (MLPCC). The Corporation's principal European broker-dealer subsidiaries are Merrill Lynch International (MLI) and BofA Securities Europe SA (BofASE). As a result of resolution planning, effective May 13, 2019, the business of MLPF&S was reorganized into two affiliated broker-dealers: MLPF&S and BofAS, a newly formed broker-dealer. Under the reorganization, BofAS became the legal entity for the institutional services that were previously provided by MLPF&S, while the retail services remain with MLPF&S. For additional information, see the Corporation's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 13, 2019. For more information on resolution planning, see Item 1. Business Resolution Planning of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . The U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the net capital requirements of Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act. BofAS and MLPCC are also registered as futures commission merchants and are subject to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Regulation 1.17. MLPF&S computes its minimum capital requirement in accordance with Rule 15c3-1. At June 30, 2019 , MLPF&S' regulatory net capital was $3.9 billion which exceeded the minimum requirement of $111 million by $3.8 billion. BofAS also computes its minimum capital requirement in accordance with Rule 15c3-1. In accordance therewith, BofAS is required to maintain tentative net capital in excess of $1.0 billion and net capital in excess of the greater of $500 million or a certain percentage of its reserve requirement. BofAS is also required to hold a certain percentage of its risk-based margin in order to meet its CFTC minimum net capital requirement. At June 30, 2019 , BofAS had tentative net capital of $12.7 billion. BofAS also had regulatory net capital of $10.6 billion which exceeded the minimum requirement of $2.1 billion by $8.5 billion. MLPCC is a fully-guaranteed subsidiary of BofAS and provides clearing and settlement services. At June 30, 2019, MLPCC regulatory net capital of $4.3 billion exceeded the minimum requirement of $1.1 billion by $3.2 billion. Our European broker-dealers are subject to regulation by non-U.S. regulators. MLI, a U.K. investment firm, is regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority, and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. At June 30, 2019 , MLI capital resources were $35.0 billion, which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $13.7 billion. BofASE, a French investment firm, is regulated by the Autorit de Contr le Prudentiel et de R solution and the Autorit des March Financiers, and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. At June 30, 2019 , BofASE's capital resources were $2.8 billion which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $1.0 billion. Liquidity Risk Funding and Liquidity Risk Management Our primary liquidity risk management objective is to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral needs while continuing to support our businesses and customers under a range of economic conditions. To achieve that objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk under expected and stressed conditions, maintain liquidity and access to diverse funding sources, including our stable deposit base, and seek to align liquidity-related incentives and risks. We define liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we can use to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations as those obligations arise. We manage our liquidity position through 25 Bank of America line of business and ALM activities, as well as through our legal entity funding strategy, on both a forward and current (including intraday) basis under both expected and stressed conditions. We believe that a centralized approach to funding and liquidity management enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding sources, minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events. For more information regarding global funding and liquidity risk management, as well as our liquidity sources, liquidity arrangements, contingency planning and credit ratings discussed below, see Liquidity Risk in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . NB Holdings Corporation We have intercompany arrangements with certain key subsidiaries under which we transferred certain assets of Bank of America Corporation, as the parent company, which is a separate and distinct legal entity from our banking and nonbank subsidiaries, and agreed to transfer certain additional parent company assets not needed to satisfy anticipated near-term expenditures, to NB Holdings Corporation, a wholly-owned holding company subsidiary (NB Holdings). The parent company is expected to continue to have access to the same flow of dividends, interest and other amounts of cash necessary to service its debt, pay dividends and perform other obligations as it would have had if it had not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets. These arrangements support our preferred single point of entry resolution strategy, under which only the parent company would be resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Global Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets Table 14 presents average Global Liquidity Sources (GLS) for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . Table 14 Average Global Liquidity Sources Three Months Ended (Dollars in billions) June 30 2019 December 31 2018 Parent company and NB Holdings $ 64 $ 76 Bank subsidiaries 432 420 Other regulated entities 56 48 Total Average Global Liquidity Sources $ 552 $ 544 We maintain liquidity available to the Corporation, including the parent company and selected subsidiaries, in the form of cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Typically, parent company and NB Holdings liquidity is in the form of cash deposited with BANA. Our bank subsidiaries liquidity is primarily driven by deposit and lending activity, as well as securities valuation and net debt activity. Liquidity at bank subsidiaries excludes the cash deposited by the parent company and NB Holdings. Our bank subsidiaries can also generate incremental liquidity by pledging a range of unencumbered loans and securities to certain FHLBs and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against this pool of specifically-identified eligible assets was $356 billion and $344 billion at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . We have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against these assets, including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loans and securities collateral. Eligibility is defined in guidelines from the FHLBs and the Federal Reserve and is subject to change at their discretion. Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries can generally be used only to fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries, and transfers to the parent company or nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to prior regulatory approval. Liquidity held in other regulated entities, comprised primarily of broker-dealer subsidiaries, is primarily available to meet the obligations of that entity and transfers to the parent company or to any other subsidiary may be subject to prior regulatory approval due to regulatory restrictions and minimum requirements. Our other regulated entities also hold unencumbered investment-grade securities and equities that we believe could be used to generate additional liquidity. Table 15 presents the composition of average GLS for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . Table 15 Average Global Liquidity Sources Composition Three Months Ended (Dollars in billions) June 30 2019 December 31 2018 Cash on deposit $ 101 $ 113 U.S. Treasury securities 97 81 U.S. agency securities and mortgage-backed securities 341 340 Non-U.S. government securities 13 10 Total Average Global Liquidity Sources $ 552 $ 544 Our GLS are substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the final U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) rules. However, HQLA for purposes of calculating LCR is not reported at market value, but at a lower value that incorporates regulatory deductions and the exclusion of excess liquidity held at certain subsidiaries. The LCR is calculated as the amount of a financial institution unencumbered HQLA relative to the estimated net cash outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period of significant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. Our average consolidated HQLA, on a net basis, was $449 billion and $446 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . For the same periods, the average consolidated LCR was 115 percent and 118 percent . Our LCR will fluctuate due to normal business flows from customer activity. Liquidity Stress Analysis We utilize liquidity stress analysis to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our subsidiaries to meet contractual and contingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios. For more information on our liquidity stress analysis, see Liquidity Risk Liquidity Stress Analysis in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Diversified Funding Sources We fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits, and secured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally coordinated funding approach diversified across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups. We fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposits, which were $1.38 trillion at both June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . Our trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded on a secured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements, and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions. Long-term Debt During the six months ended June 30, 2019 , we issued $32.6 billion of long-term debt consisting of $19.4 billion for Bank of Bank of America 26 America Corporation, substantially all of which was TLAC eligible, $6.1 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $7.1 billion of other debt. Substantially all of the long-term, TLAC-eligible senior notes issued by Bank of America Corporation since late 2016 are callable, at our option, at least one year before each stated maturity date. The call features give us the flexibility to retire long-term notes before their final year outstanding, when they are no longer eligible to count toward TLAC requirements, and replace them with new TLAC-eligible debt, should we choose to do so. During the six months ended June 30, 2019 , we had total long-term debt maturities and redemptions in the aggregate of $33.8 billion consisting of $13.2 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $16.1 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $4.5 billion of other debt. Table 16 presents the carrying value of aggregate annual contractual maturities of long-term debt at June 30, 2019 .

(2) Represents the total long-term debt included in the liabilities of consolidated VIEs on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Table 17 presents our long-term debt by major currency at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . Table 17 Long-term Debt by Major Currency (Dollars in millions) June 30 2019 December 31 2018 U.S. dollar $ 186,394 $ 180,724 Euro 34,490 34,328 British pound 5,453 5,450 Japanese yen 4,302 3,038 Canadian dollar 3,871 2,936 Australian dollar 1,822 1,722 Other 1,679 1,194 Total long-term debt $ 238,011 $ 229,392 Total long-term debt increased $8.6 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2019 primarily due to debt issuances and valuation adjustments, partially offset by maturities and redemptions. We may, from time to time, purchase outstanding debt instruments in various transactions, depending on market conditions, liquidity and other factors. Our other regulated entities may also make markets in our debt instruments to provide liquidity for investors. For more information on long-term debt funding, see Note 11 Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . We use derivative transactions to manage the duration, interest rate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering the characteristics of the assets they are funding. For more information on our ALM activities, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 45 . We may issue unsecured debt in the form of structured notes for client purposes, certain of which qualify as TLAC-eligible debt. During the six months ended June 30, 2019 , we issued $4.7 billion of structured notes, which are debt obligations that pay investors returns linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these liabilities with derivatives and/or investments in the underlying instruments, so that from a funding perspective, the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We could be required to settle certain structured note obligations for cash or other securities prior to maturity under certain circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning purposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date. Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price. Credit Ratings Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating agencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other securities, including asset securitizations. On June 12, 2019, Fitch Ratings (Fitch) completed its periodic review of the 12 large, complex securities trading and universal banks, including Bank of America Corporation. The agency affirmed the long-term and short-term senior debt ratings of the Corporation 27 Bank of America and all of its rated subsidiaries, except Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Designated Activity Company, which Fitch upgraded by one notch to AA-/F1+. The rating outlook for all long-term ratings is currently stable. On March 6, 2019, Moody Investors Service (Moody s) upgraded the long-term and short-term ratings of the Corporation by one notch to A2/P-1 from A3/P-2 for senior debt, as well as the long-term ratings of its rated subsidiaries, including BANA, which the agency upgraded to Aa2 from Aa3 for senior debt. Moody concurrently affirmed the short-term ratings of the Corporation rated subsidiaries, including BANA. Moody cited the Corporation strengthening profitability, continued adherence to a conservative risk profile and stable capital ratios as rationale for the upgrade. This concluded the review for upgrade that Moody initiated on December 5, 2018. The rating outlook for all long-term ratings is currently stable. The ratings from Standard & Poor Global Ratings (S&P) for the Corporation and its subsidiaries did not change from those disclosed in the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Table 18 presents the Corporation current long-term/short-term senior debt ratings and outlooks expressed by the rating agencies. BofAS and BofASE, which were initially rated by S&P and Fitch during the first quarter of 2019 , are now operational in the U.S. and European Economic Area (excluding the U.K.). The long-term and the short-term debt ratings of both entities were unchanged during the second quarter of 2019 . For more information on additional collateral and termination payments that could be required in connection with certain over-the-counter derivative contracts and other trading agreements as a result of a credit rating downgrade, see Note 3 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein and Item 1A.

For information on the new accounting standard on credit losses that is effective on January 1, 2020 and the potential impact on our allowance for credit losses, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Credit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower credit cycle. Statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio management including underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting credit limits, and establishing operating processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns. Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources such as credit bureaus and/or internal historical experience and are a component of our consumer credit risk management process. These models are used in part to assist in making both new and ongoing credit decisions, as well as portfolio management strategies, including authorizations and line management, collection practices and strategies, and determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allocated capital for credit risk. Consumer Credit Portfolio Improvement in home prices continued during the six months ended June 30, 2019 resulting in improved credit quality compared to the same period in 2018 . Additionally, lower credit losses in the consumer real estate portfolio due primarily to non-core loan sales were partially offset by seasoning in the U.S. credit card portfolio compared to the same period in 2018 . Improved credit quality and continued loan balance runoff primarily in the non-core consumer real estate portfolio, partially offset by seasoning within the U.S. credit card portfolio, drove a $113 million decrease in the consumer allowance for loan and lease losses during the six months ended June 30, 2019 to $4.7 billion . For additional information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 41 . For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, charge-offs and troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) for the consumer portfolio, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 5 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Table 19 presents our outstanding consumer loans and leases, consumer nonperforming loans and accruing consumer loans past due 90 days or more. Nonperforming loans do not include past due consumer credit card loans, other unsecured loans and in general, consumer loans not secured by real estate (bankruptcy loans are included) as these loans are typically charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due. Real estate-secured past due consumer loans that Bank of America 28 are insured by the FHA or individually insured under long-term standby agreements with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (collectively, the fully-insured loan portfolio) are reported as accruing as opposed to nonperforming since the principal repayment is insured. Fully-insured loans included in accruing past due 90 days or more are primarily from our repurchases of delinquent FHA loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA). Nonperforming loans and accruing balances past due 90 days or more also do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option even though the customer may be contractually past due.

We categorize consumer real estate loans as core and non-core based on loan and customer characteristics such as origination date, product type, loan-to-value (LTV), Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score and delinquency status consistent with our current consumer and mortgage servicing strategy. Generally, loans that were originated after January 1, 2010, qualified under government-sponsored enterprise underwriting guidelines, or otherwise met our underwriting guidelines in place in 2015 are characterized as core loans. All other loans are generally characterized as non-core loans and represent runoff portfolios. Core loans as reported in Table 21 include loans held in the Consumer Banking and GWIM segments, as well as loans held for ALM activities in All Other . As shown in Table 21 , outstanding core consumer real estate loans increased $11.1 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2019 driven by an increase of $13.5 billion in residential mortgage, partially offset by a $2.4 billion decrease in home equity. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 , we sold $891 million and $1.8 billion of consumer real estate loans. 29 Bank of America Table 21 Consumer Real Estate Portfolio (1) Outstandings Nonperforming Net Charge-offs June 30 2019 December 31 2018 June 30 2019 December 31 2018 Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Core portfolio Residential mortgage $ 207,257 $ 193,695 $ 989 $ 1,010 $ 7 $ 4 $ 4 $ 13 Home equity 37,577 40,010 727 955 10 14 31 37 Total core portfolio 244,834 233,705 1,716 1,965 17 18 35 50 Non-core portfolio Residential mortgage 12,672 14,862 755 883 (4 ) 3 (17 ) (12 ) Home equity 6,557 8,276 476 938 (165 ) (14 ) (175 ) (4 ) Total non-core portfolio 19,229 23,138 1,231 1,821 (169 ) (11 ) (192 ) (16 ) Consumer real estate portfolio Residential mortgage 219,929 208,557 1,744 1,893 3 7 (13 ) 1 Home equity 44,134 48,286 1,203 1,893 (155 ) (144 ) 33 Total consumer real estate portfolio $ 264,063 $ 256,843 $ 2,947 $ 3,786 $ (152 ) $ 7 $ (157 ) $ 34 Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Provision for Loan and Lease Losses June 30 2019 December 31 2018 Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 2019 2018 2019 2018 Core portfolio Residential mortgage $ 217 $ 214 $ 11 $ 1 $ 7 $ 9 Home equity 164 228 (11 ) (23 ) (33 ) (24 ) Total core portfolio 381 442 (22 ) (26 ) (15 ) Non-core portfolio Residential mortgage 141 208 (21 ) (39 ) (52 ) (125 ) Home equity 197 278 (218 ) (60 ) (231 ) (109 ) Total non-core portfolio 338 486 (239 ) (99 ) (283 ) (234 ) Consumer real estate portfolio Residential mortgage 358 422 (10 ) (38 ) (45 ) (116 ) Home equity 361 506 (229 ) (83 ) (264 ) (133 ) Total consumer real estate portfolio $ 719 $ 928 $ (239 ) $ (121 ) $ (309 ) $ (249 ) (1) Outstandings and nonperforming loans exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. Consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option include residential mortgage loans of $300 million and $336 million and home equity loans of $358 million and $346 million at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . For additional information, see Note 16 Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements . We believe that the presentation of information adjusted to exclude the impact of the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option is more representative of the ongoing operations and credit quality of the business. As a result, in the following tables and discussions of the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios, we exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option and provide information that excludes the impact of the fully-insured loan portfolio in certain credit quality statistics. Residential Mortgage The residential mortgage portfolio made up the largest percentage of our consumer loan portfolio at 49 percent of consumer loans and leases at June 30, 2019 . Approximately 47 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio was in Consumer Banking and 36 percent was in GWIM. The remaining portion was in All Other and was comprised of originated loans, purchased loans used in our overall ALM activities, delinquent FHA loans repurchased pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA as well as loans repurchased related to our representations and warranties. Outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio increased $11.4 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2019 as retention of new originations was partially offset by loan sales of $1.0 billion and runoff. At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , the residential mortgage portfolio included $19.3 billion and $20.1 billion of outstanding fully-insured loans, of which $12.7 billion and $14.0 billion had FHA insurance with the remainder protected by long-term standby agreements. Table 22 presents certain residential mortgage key credit statistics on both a reported basis and excluding the fully-insured loan portfolio. The following discussion presents the residential mortgage portfolio excluding the fully-insured loan portfolio. Bank of America 30 Table 22 Residential Mortgage Key Credit Statistics Reported Basis (1) Excluding Fully-insured Loans (1) (Dollars in millions) June 30 2019 December 31 2018 June 30 2019 December 31 2018 Outstandings $ 219,929 $ 208,557 $ 200,621 $ 188,427 Accruing past due 30 days or more 3,208 3,945 1,053 1,155 Accruing past due 90 days or more 1,364 1,884 Nonperforming loans 1,744 1,893 1,744 1,893 Percent of portfolio Refreshed LTV greater than 90 but less than or equal to 100 2 % 2 % 2 % 2 % Refreshed LTV greater than 100 1 1 1 1 Refreshed FICO below 620 3 4 2 2 2006 and 2007 vintages (2) 5 6 5 6 (1) Outstandings, accruing past due, nonperforming loans and percentages of portfolio exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. (2) These vintages of loans accounted for $479 million , or 27 percent , and $536 million , or 28 percent , of nonperforming residential mortgage loans at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . Nonperforming residential mortgage loans decreased $149 million during the six months ended June 30, 2019 primarily driven by sales. Of the nonperforming residential mortgage loans at June 30, 2019 , $711 million , or 41 percent , were current on contractual payments. Loans accruing past due 30 days or more decreased $102 million due to continued improvement in credit quality as well as loan sales in the non-core portfolio. Net charge-offs decreased $4 million to $3 million and $14 million to a net recovery of $13 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 primarily due to continued improvement in credit quality. Loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent represented one percent of the residential mortgage loan portfolio at both June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . Of the loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent, less than one percent were nonperforming at both June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . Loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent reflect loans where the outstanding carrying value of the loan is greater than the most recent valuation of the property securing the loan. Of the $200.6 billion in total residential mortgage loans outstanding at June 30, 2019 , as shown in Table 22 , 28 percent were originated as interest-only loans. The outstanding balance of interest-only residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period was $8.5 billion , or 15 percent , at June 30, 2019 . Residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period generally have experienced a higher rate of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status compared to the residential mortgage portfolio as a whole. At June 30, 2019 , $168 million , or two percent , of outstanding interest-only residential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $1.1 billion , or one percent , for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, at June 30, 2019 , $371 million , or four percent , of outstanding interest-only residential mortgage loans that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming, of which $143 million were contractually current, compared to $1.7 billion , or one percent , for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. Loans that have yet to enter the amortization period in our interest-only residential mortgage portfolio are primarily well-collateralized loans to our wealth management clients and have an interest-only period of three to ten years. Approximately 92 percent of these loans that have yet to enter the amortization period will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2022 or later. Table 23 presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the residential mortgage portfolio. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) within California represented 16 percent of outstandings at both June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 13 percent of outstandings at both June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 .

(3) Amounts exclude the fully-insured loan portfolio. 31 Bank of America Home Equity At June 30, 2019 , the home equity portfolio made up 10 percent of the consumer portfolio and was comprised of home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), home equity loans and reverse mortgages. At June 30, 2019 , our HELOC portfolio had an outstanding balance of $40.8 billion , or 92 percent of the total home equity portfolio, compared to $44.3 billion , also 92 percent , at December 31, 2018 . HELOCs generally have an initial draw period of 10 years, and after the initial draw period ends, the loans generally convert to 15- or 20-year amortizing loans. At June 30, 2019 , our home equity loan portfolio had an outstanding balance of $1.6 billion , or four percent of the total home equity portfolio, compared to $1.8 billion , also four percent , at December 31, 2018 . Home equity loans are almost all fixed-rate loans with amortizing payment terms of 10 to 30 years, and of the $1.6 billion at June 30, 2019 , 69 percent have 25- to 30-year terms. At June 30, 2019 , our reverse mortgage portfolio had an outstanding balance of $1.7 billion , or four percent of the total home equity portfolio, compared to $2.2 billion , also four percent , at December 31, 2018 . We no longer originate reverse mortgages. At June 30, 2019 , 77 percent of the home equity portfolio was in Consumer Banking , 15 percent was in All Other and the remainder of the portfolio was primarily in GWIM . Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased $4.2 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2019 primarily due to paydowns and loan sales of $803 million outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines. Of the total home equity portfolio at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , $16.1 billion , or 36 percent , and $17.3 billion , or 36 percent , were in first-lien positions. At June 30, 2019 , outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio that were in a second-lien or more junior-lien position and where we also held the first-lien loan totaled $7.5 billion , or 17 percent of our total home equity portfolio. Unused HELOCs totaled $43.5 billion at June 30, 2019 compared to $43.1 billion at December 31, 2018 . The increase was primarily driven by the impact of new production partially offset by accounts reaching the end of their draw period, which automatically eliminates open line exposure, and customers choosing to close accounts. The HELOC utilization rate was 48 percent and 51 percent at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . Table 24 presents certain home equity portfolio key credit statistics. Table 24 Home Equity Key Credit Statistics (1) (Dollars in millions) June 30 2019 December 31 2018 Outstandings $ 44,134 $ 48,286 Accruing past due 30 days or more (2) 266 363 Nonperforming loans (2) 1,203 1,893 Percent of portfolio Refreshed CLTV greater than 90 but less than or equal to 100 2 % 2 % Refreshed CLTV greater than 100 3 3 Refreshed FICO below 620 4 5 2006 and 2007 vintages (3) 20 22 (1) Outstandings, accruing past due, nonperforming loans and percentages of the portfolio exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. (2) Accruing past due 30 days or more include $38 million and $48 million and nonperforming loans include $117 million and $218 million of loans where we serviced the underlying first lien at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . (3) These vintages of loans have higher refreshed combined loan-to-value (CLTV) ratios and accounted for 45 percent and 49 percent of nonperforming home equity loans at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . Nonperforming outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased $690 million during the six months ended June 30, 2019 as outflows, including sales, outpaced new inflows. Of the nonperforming home equity loans at June 30, 2019 , $626 million , or 52 percent , were current on contractual payments. Nonperforming loans that are contractually current primarily consist of collateral-dependent TDRs, including those that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, junior-lien loans where the underlying first lien is 90 days or more past due, as well as loans that have not yet demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance following a TDR. We estimate that approximately $139 million of junior-lien loans had first-lien loans that were 90 days or more past due. In addition, $354 million , or 29 percent , of nonperforming home equity loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell. Accruing loans that were 30 days or more past due decreased $97 million during the six months ended June 30, 2019 . Net charge-offs decreased $155 million to a net recovery of $155 million , and $177 million to a net recovery of $144 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 primarily driven by recoveries from the sales of previously charged off non-core home equity loans. Outstanding balances with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent comprised three percent of the home equity portfolio at both June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . Outstanding balances with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent reflect loans where our loan and available line of credit combined with any outstanding senior liens against the property are equal to or greater than the most recent valuation of the property securing the loan. Depending on the value of the property, there may be collateral in excess of the first lien that is available to reduce the severity of loss on the second lien. Of those outstanding balances with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent, 96 percent of the customers were current on their home equity loan and 92 percent of second-lien loans with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent were current on both their second-lien and underlying first-lien loans at June 30, 2019 . Of the $44.1 billion in total home equity portfolio outstandings at June 30, 2019 , as shown in Table 24 , 18 percent require interest-only payments. The outstanding balance of HELOCs that have reached the end of their draw period and have entered the amortization period was $13.8 billion at June 30, 2019 . The HELOCs that have entered the amortization period have experienced a higher percentage of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status when compared to the HELOC portfolio as a whole. At June 30, 2019 , $189 million , or one percent, of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more. In addition, at June 30, 2019 , $1.0 billion , or eight percent, were nonperforming. For more information on HELOC amortization, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Bank of America 32 Risk Management in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Although we do not actively track how many of our home equity customers pay only the minimum amount due on their home equity loans and lines, we can infer some of this information through a review of our HELOC portfolio that we service and that is still in its revolving period. During the three months ended June 30, 2019 , 26 percent of these customers with an outstanding balance did not pay any principal on their HELOCs. Table 25 presents outstandings, nonperforming balances and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the home equity portfolio. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 13 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California made up 11 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 .

U.S. Credit Card At June 30, 2019 , 97 percent of the U.S. credit card portfolio was managed in Consumer Banking with the remainder in GWIM . Outstandings in the U.S. credit card portfolio decreased $4.3 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2019 to $94.0 billion due to a seasonal decline in purchase volumes. Net charge-offs increased $23 million to $762 million and $67 million to $1.5 billion during the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 due to portfolio seasoning. U.S. credit card loans 30 days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased $151 million during the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased $53 million , driven by seasonal declines. Unused lines of credit for U.S. credit card totaled $342.5 billion and $334.8 billion at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . The increase in unused lines was driven by seasonally lower purchase volumes, as well as account growth and lines of credit increases. Table 26 presents certain state concentrations for the U.S. credit card portfolio.

Outstandings in the direct/indirect portfolio decreased $316 million during the six months ended June 30, 2019 to $90.9 billion primarily due to declines in securities-based lending driven by repayments and lower draws. Net charge-offs decreased $1 million to $40 million and $6 million to $94 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 . Table 27 presents certain state concentrations for the direct/indirect consumer loan portfolio. 33 Bank of America Table 27 Direct/Indirect State Concentrations Outstandings Accruing Past Due 90 Days or More Net Charge-offs June 30 2019 December 31 2018 June 30 2019 December 31 2018 Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 California $ 11,740 $ 11,734 $ 3 $ 4 $ 5 $ 5 $ 12 $ 11 Florida 10,034 10,240 3 4 8 9 16 19 Texas 9,698 9,876 4 6 5 7 15 16 New York 6,343 6,296 1 2 3 2 6 5 New Jersey 3,358 3,308 1 1 1 2 1 Other 49,677 49,712 16 21 18 18 43 48 Total direct/indirect loan portfolio $ 90,850 $ 91,166 $ 28 $ 38 $ 40 $ 41 $ 94 $ 100 Nonperforming Consumer Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity Table 28 presents nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 . During the six months ended June 30, 2019 , nonperforming consumer loans decreased $815 million to $3.0 billion primarily driven by loan sales of $666 million . At June 30, 2019 , $950 million , or 31 percent , of nonperforming loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to their estimated property value less costs to sell. In addition, at June 30, 2019 , $1.4 billion , or 46 percent , of nonperforming consumer loans were modified and are now current after successful trial periods, or are current loans classified as nonperforming loans in accordance with applicable policies. Foreclosed properties decreased $39 million during the six months ended June 30, 2019 to $205 million as liquidations outpaced additions. Certain delinquent government-guaranteed loans (principally FHA-insured loans) are excluded from our nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties activity as we expect we will be reimbursed once the property is conveyed to the guarantor for principal and, up to certain limits, costs incurred during the foreclosure process and interest accrued during the holding period. We classify junior-lien home equity loans as nonperforming when the first-lien loan becomes 90 days past due even if the junior-lien loan is performing. At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , $139 million and $221 million of such junior-lien home equity loans were included in nonperforming loans and leases. Nonperforming loans also include certain loans that have been modified in TDRs where economic concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. Nonperforming TDRs are included in Table 28 .

Performing TDR balances are excluded from nonperforming loans and leases in Table 28 .

(2) Residential mortgage performing TDRs include $2.3 billion and $2.8 billion of loans that were fully-insured at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . (3) At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , home equity TDRs deemed collateral dependent totaled $817 million and $1.3 billion , and include $534 million and $961 million of loans classified as nonperforming and $283 million and $322 million of loans classified as performing. In addition to modifying consumer real estate loans, we work with customers who are experiencing financial difficulty by modifying credit card and other consumer loans. Credit card and other consumer loan modifications generally involve a reduction in the customer interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months, all of which are considered TDRs (the renegotiated TDR portfolio). Modifications of credit card and other consumer loans are made through renegotiation programs utilizing direct customer contact, but may also utilize external renegotiation programs. The renegotiated TDR portfolio is excluded in large part from Table 28 as substantially all of the loans remain on accrual status until either charged off or paid in full. At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , our renegotiated TDR portfolio was $627 million and $566 million , of which $533 million and $481 million were current or less than 30 days past due under the modified terms. The increase in the renegotiated TDR portfolio was primarily driven by new renegotiated enrollments outpacing runoff of existing portfolios. Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Commercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal that concentrations of credit exposure continue to be aligned with our risk appetite. We review, measure and manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, customer relationship and loan size. We also review, measure and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property type. In addition, within our non-U.S. portfolio, we evaluate exposures by region and by country. Tables 34 , 37 and 40 summarize our concentrations. We also utilize syndications of exposure to third parties, loan sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio. For more information on our industry concentrations, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Industry Concentrations on page 38 and Table 37 . For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status and net charge-offs for the commercial portfolio, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Commercial Credit Portfolio During the six months ended June 30, 2019 , credit quality among large corporate and middle-market borrowers in our commercial and industrial portfolio remained strong. Credit quality of commercial real estate borrowers in most sectors remained stable with conservative LTV ratios. However, some of the real estate markets experienced slowing tenant demand and decelerating rental income. Total commercial utilized credit exposure increased $7.8 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2019 to $628.8 billion primarily driven by higher loans and leases, partially offset by lower loans held-for-sale. The utilization rate for loans and leases, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and financial guarantees, and commercial letters of credit, in the aggregate, was 59 percent at both June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . Table 30 presents commercial credit exposure by type for utilized, unfunded and total binding committed credit exposure. Commercial utilized credit exposure includes SBLCs and financial guarantees and commercial letters of credit that have been issued and for which we are legally bound to advance funds under prescribed conditions during a specified time period, and excludes exposure related to trading account assets. Although funds have not yet been advanced, these exposure types are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes.

(5) Derivative assets are carried at fair value, reflect the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and have been reduced by cash collateral of $33.9 billion and $32.4 billion at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . Not reflected in utilized and committed exposure is additional non-cash derivative collateral held of $ 33.1 billion and $33.0 billion at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , which consists primarily of other marketable securities. 35 Bank of America Outstanding commercial loans and leases increased $14.4 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2019 primarily in the commercial and industrial portfolio. The allowance for loan and lease losses for the commercial portfolio increased $39 million to $4.8 billion at June 30, 2019 . For additional information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 41 .

Table 33 presents commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure by loan type. Criticized exposure corresponds to the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful asset categories as defined by regulatory authorities. Total commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure increased $773 million , or seven percent , during the six months ended June 30, 2019 driven by a small number of client downgrades across various industries and was not indicative of broader issues in the portfolio. At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , 92 percent and 91 percent of commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure was secured.

Bank of America 36 Commercial and Industrial Commercial and industrial loans include U.S. commercial and non-U.S. commercial portfolios. U.S. Commercial At June 30, 2019 , 70 percent of the U.S. commercial loan portfolio, excluding small business, was managed in Global Banking, 15 percent in Global Markets , 13 percent in GWIM (generally business-purpose loans for high net worth clients) and the remainder primarily in Consumer Banking . U.S. commercial loans increased $6.4 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2019 , primarily in Global Banking . Net charge-offs increased $47 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 due to a single-name utility client. Reservable criticized utilized exposure increased $600 million , or eight percent , driven by a small number of client downgrades across industries. Non-U.S. Commercial At June 30, 2019 , 81 percent of the non-U.S. commercial loan portfolio was managed in Global Banking and 19 percent in Global Markets . Non-U.S. commercial loans increased $5.4 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2019 , primarily in Global Banking . Nonperforming non-U.S. commercial loans increased $42 million due to a single-name client. Reservable criticized utilized exposure increased $238 million , or 23 percent , driven by a few client downgrades. For more information on the non-U.S. commercial portfolio, see Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 40 . Commercial Real Estate Commercial real estate primarily includes commercial loans and leases secured by non-owner-occupied real estate and is dependent on the sale or lease of the real estate as the primary source of repayment. Outstanding loans increased $814 million , or one percent , during the six months ended June 30, 2019 to $61.7 billion due to new originations slightly outpacing paydowns. The portfolio remains diversified across property types and geographic regions. California represented the largest state concentration at 24 percent and 23 percent of the commercial real estate portfolio at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . The commercial real estate portfolio is predominantly managed in Global Banking and consists of loans made primarily to public and private developers, and commercial real estate firms. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 , we continued to see low default rates and solid credit quality in both the residential and non-residential portfolios. We use a number of proactive risk mitigation initiatives to reduce adversely rated exposure in the commercial real estate portfolio, including transfers of deteriorating exposures to management by independent special asset officers and the pursuit of loan restructurings or asset sales to achieve the best results for our customers and the Corporation. Nonperforming commercial real estate loans and foreclosed properties decreased $40 million , or 19 percent , during the six months ended June 30, 2019 to $172 million , due to a loan sale.

U.S. Small Business Commercial The U.S. small business commercial loan portfolio is comprised of small business card loans and small business loans managed in Consumer Banking . Credit card-related products were 53 percent and 51 percent of the U.S. small business commercial portfolio at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . Of the U.S. small business commercial net charge-offs, 99 percent and 97 percent were credit card-related products for the three and six months 37 Bank of America ended June 30, 2019 compared to 92 percent and 94 percent for same periods in 2018 . Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity Table 35 presents the nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity during the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 . Nonperforming loans do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. During the six months ended June 30, 2019 , nonperforming commercial loans and leases increased $58 million to $1.2 billion . At June 30, 2019 , 90 percent of commercial nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties were secured and 57 percent were contractually current. Commercial nonperforming loans were carried at 86 percent of their unpaid principal balance before consideration of the allowance for loan and lease losses as the carrying value of these loans has been reduced to the estimated collateral value less costs to sell.

(3) Commercial loans and leases may be returned to performing status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected, or when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection. TDRs are generally classified as performing after a sustained period of demonstrated payment performance. (4) Outstanding commercial loans exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. Table 36 presents our commercial TDRs by product type and performing status. U.S. small business commercial TDRs are comprised of renegotiated small business card loans and small business loans. The renegotiated small business card loans are not classified as nonperforming as they are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due.

Our commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. Total commercial committed exposure increased $22.4 billion , or two percent, during the six months ended June 30, 2019 to $1.0 trillion . The increase in commercial committed exposure was concentrated in the Finance companies, Energy and Consumer services industry sectors. Increases were partially offset by decreased exposure to the Pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, Technology hardware and equipment, and Insurance industry sectors.

This growth occurred in Consumer finance, Diversified financials, and Thrift and mortgage finance. Energy committed exposure increased $5.1 billion as a result of growth in Oil, gas and consumable fuels. Consumer services committed exposure increased $3.9 billion led by increases in Recreation and amusement and Sports.

(4) Represents net notional credit protection purchased to hedge funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures. For additional information, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Risk Mitigation . Risk Mitigation We purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. To lower the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, we may add credit exposure within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, was $3.3 billion and $2.7 billion . We recorded net losses on these positions of $13 million and $77 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to net gains of $7 million and net losses of $10 million for the same periods in 2018 on these positions. The gains and losses on these instruments were offset by gains and losses on the related exposures. The Value-at-Risk (VaR) results for these exposures are included in the fair value option portfolio information in Table 43 . For additional information, see Trading Risk Management on page 43 .

Non-U.S. Portfolio Our non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios are subject to country risk. We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in government policies. A risk management framework is in place to measure, monitor and manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. In addition to the direct risk of doing business in a country, we also are exposed to indirect country risks (e.g., related to the collateral received on secured financing transactions or related to client clearing activities). These indirect exposures are managed in the normal course of business through credit, market and operational risk governance, rather than through country risk governance. Table 40 presents our 20 largest non-U.S. country exposures at June 30, 2019 . These exposures accounted for 90 percent of our total non-U.S. exposure at June 30, 2019 and 89 percent at December 31, 2018 . Net country exposure for these 20 countries increased $29.3 billion in the six months ended June 30, 2019 , primarily driven by increased sovereign and corporate exposure across multiple countries. For more information on the top 20 non-U.S. countries exposure, see Non-U.S. Portfolio in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K .

Our largest emerging market country exposure at June 30, 2019 was India, with net exposure of $14.2 billion , concentrated in multinational companies and large commercial banks. The outlook for policy direction and therefore economic performance in the EU remains uncertain as a consequence of reduced political cohesion among EU countries. Additionally, we believe that the uncertainty in the U.K. ability to negotiate a favorable exit from the EU will further weigh on economic performance. For additional information, see Executive Summary Recent Developments U.K. Exit from the EU on page 3 . Our largest EU country exposure at June 30, 2019 was the U.K. with net exposure of $55.2 billion , which represents a $306 million increase from December 31, 2018 . Our second largest EU exposure was Germany with net exposure of $45.8 billion , which represents a $17.2 billion increase from December 31, 2018 . The increase in Germany was primarily driven by increased sovereign exposure. In light of ongoing trade tensions, we continue to closely monitor our exposures to tariff-sensitive regions and industries, particularly to countries that account for a large percentage of U.S. trade, such as China. Our total net country exposure to China at June 30, 2019 was $13.2 billion , concentrated in large state-owned companies, subsidiaries of multinational corporations and commercial banks. Bank of America 40 Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses increased $30 million to $857 million , and $209 million to $1.9 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 . The provision for credit losses was $30 million and $8 million lower than net charge-offs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 , resulting in a decrease in the allowance for credit losses. This compared to a decrease of $169 million and $246 million in the allowance for credit losses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 . Net charge-offs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were $887 million and $1.9 billion compared to $996 million and $1.9 billion for the same periods in 2018. We expect net charge-offs of approximately $1 billion for each of the remaining quarters in 2019, assuming current economic conditions continue. The provision for credit losses for the consumer portfolio decreased $117 million to $640 million and $35 million to $1.5 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 . The decrease was primarily driven by home equity loan sales, partially offset by seasoning in the U.S. credit card portfolio. The provision for credit losses for the commercial portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, increased $147 million to $217 million and $244 million to $400 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 . The increase was primarily driven by energy releases in the prior-year periods. The increase in the six months ended June 30, 2019 included a single-name utility client charge-off. Allowance for Credit Losses Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses During the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 , the factors that impacted the allowance for loan and lease losses included improvement in the credit quality of the consumer real estate portfolios driven by continuing improvements in the U.S. economy and strong labor markets, proactive credit risk management initiatives and the impact of high credit quality originations. Evidencing the improvements in the U.S. economy and strong labor markets are low levels of unemployment and increases in home prices. In addition to these improvements, in the consumer portfolio, nonperforming consumer loans decreased $815 million during the six months ended June 30, 2019 as loan sales, returns to performing status and paydowns continued to outpace new nonaccrual loans. The allowance for loan and lease losses for the consumer portfolio, as presented in Table 42 , was $4.7 billion at June 30, 2019 , a decrease of $113 million from December 31, 2018 . The decrease was primarily in the consumer real estate portfolio, partially offset by an increase in the U.S. credit card portfolio. The reduction in the allowance for the consumer real estate portfolio was due to improved home prices, lower nonperforming loans and a decrease in loan balances in our non-core portfolio. The increase in the allowance for the U.S. credit card portfolio was driven by portfolio seasoning. The allowance for loan and lease losses for the commercial portfolio, as presented in Table 42 , was $4.8 billion at June 30, 2019 , an increase of $39 million from December 31, 2018 . Commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure increased to $11.8 billion at June 30, 2019 from $11.1 billion (to 2.19 percent from 2.08 percent of total commercial reservable utilized exposure) at December 31, 2018 , and nonperforming commercial loans increased to $1.2 billion at June 30, 2019 from $1.1 billion (to 0.23 percent from 0.22 percent of outstanding commercial loans excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option) at December 31, 2018 with the increases spread across multiple industries. See Tables 31 , 32 and 33 for more details on key commercial credit statistics. The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding was 1.00 percent at June 30, 2019 compared to 1.02 percent at December 31, 2018 . For more information on the allowance for loan and lease losses, see Allowance for Credit Losses in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new accounting standard regarding the measurement of the allowance for credit losses that will be effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2020. Upon adoption of the standard on January 1, 2020, we expect that, based on current expectations of future economic conditions, our allowance for credit losses on loans and leases may increase by up to 20 percent from its allowance for credit losses as of June 30, 2019, as disclosed herein, with a large portion of that increase driven by the U.S. credit card portfolio. The ultimate impact will depend on the characteristics of our portfolios as well as the macroeconomic conditions and forecasts upon adoption, the ultimate validation of models and methodologies, and other management judgments. For additional information regarding this new accounting standard, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we also estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments such as letters of credit, financial guarantees, unfunded bankers acceptances and binding loan commitments, excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value option. For more information on the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, see Allowance for Credit Losses in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . The reserve for unfunded lending commitments was $806 million at June 30, 2019 compared to $797 million at December 31, 2018 . 41 Bank of America Table 41 presents a rollforward of the allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 .

Trading Risk Management To evaluate risks in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of revenues generated by individual positions as well as portfolios of positions. VaR is a common statistic used to measure market risk. Our primary VaR statistic is equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level, which means that for a VaR with a one-day holding period, there should not be losses in excess of VaR, on average, 99 out of 100 trading days. Table 43 presents the total market-based portfolio VaR which is the combination of the total covered positions (and less liquid trading positions) portfolio and the fair value option portfolio. For more information on our trading risk management process and on the market risk VaR trading activities, see Trading Risk Management in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . The total market-based portfolio VaR results in Table 43 include market risk to which we are exposed from all business segments, excluding credit valuation adjustment (CVA), DVA and related hedges. The majority of this portfolio is within the Global Markets segment. Table 43 presents period-end, average, high and low daily trading VaR for the three months ended June 30, 2019 , March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2018 , as well as average daily trading VaR for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 using a 99 percent confidence level. The amounts disclosed in Table 43 and Table 44 align to the view of covered positions used in the Basel 3 capital calculations. Foreign exchange and commodity positions are always considered covered positions, regardless of trading or banking treatment for the trade, except for structural foreign currency positions that are excluded with prior regulatory approval. 43 Bank of America Table 43 Market Risk VaR for Trading Activities Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30 June 30, 2019 March 31, 2019 June 30, 2018 (Dollars in millions) Period End Average High (1) Low (1) Period End Average High (1) Low (1) Period End Average High (1) Low (1) 2019 Average 2018 Average Foreign exchange $ 6 $ 5 $ 11 $ 4 $ 8 $ 6 $ 10 $ 4 $ 8 $ 10 $ 15 $ 7 $ 6 $ 9 Interest rate 20 26 38 18 38 28 49 17 27 23 32 15 27 23 Credit 26 22 27 16 21 21 26 18 30 25 30 20 22 26 Equity 21 20 25 15 26 19 26 14 24 16 26 11 20 18 Commodities 6 6 8 4 5 7 13 4 7 9 14 4 7 8 Portfolio diversification (45 ) (48 ) (61 ) (48 ) (65 ) (55 ) (50 ) (53 ) Total covered positions portfolio 34 31 37 28 37 33 47 25 31 28 38 20 32 31 Impact from less liquid exposures 1 3 4 4 2 2 4 4 Total covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio 35 34 40 29 41 37 53 28 33 30 42 24 36 35 Fair value option loans 10 9 11 7 7 8 10 7 12 13 18 8 9 12 Fair value option hedges 10 7 11 4 4 10 17 4 8 11 17 5 9 10 Fair value option portfolio diversification (11 ) (9 ) (6 ) (9 ) (12 ) (13 ) (10 ) (12 ) Total fair value option portfolio 9 7 10 5 5 9 16 5 8 11 16 5 8 10 Portfolio diversification (7 ) (5 ) (4 ) (6 ) (5 ) (7 ) (6 ) (5 ) Total market-based portfolio $ 37 $ 36 42 31 $ 42 $ 40 56 30 $ 36 $ 34 47 28 $ 38 $ 40 (1) The high and low for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the high and low for the components. Therefore the impact from less liquid exposures and the amount of portfolio diversification, which is the difference between the total portfolio and the sum of the individual components, is not relevant. The graph below presents the daily covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio VaR for the previous five quarters, corresponding to the data in Table 43 . Additional VaR statistics produced within our single VaR model are provided in Table 44 at the same level of detail as in Table 43 . Evaluating VaR with additional statistics allows for an increased understanding of the risks in the portfolio as the historical market data used in the VaR calculation does not necessarily follow a predefined statistical distribution. Table 44 presents average trading VaR statistics at 99 percent and 95 percent confidence levels for the three months ended June 30, 2019 , March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2018 .

For more information on our backtesting process, see Trading Risk Management Backtesting in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . During the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 , there were no days in which there was a backtesting excess for our total covered portfolio VaR, utilizing a one-day holding period. Total Trading-related Revenue Total trading-related revenue, excluding brokerage fees, and CVA, DVA and funding valuation adjustment gains (losses), represents the total amount earned from trading positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. For additional information, see Trading Risk Management Total Trading-related Revenue in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . The following histogram is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019 . During the three months ended June 30, 2019 , positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 100 percent of the trading days, of which 91 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million. This compares to the three months ended March 31, 2019 where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 100 percent of the trading days, of which 89 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million. Trading Portfolio Stress Testing Because the very nature of a VaR model suggests results can exceed our estimates and it is dependent on a limited historical window, we also stress test our portfolio using scenario analysis. This analysis estimates the change in the value of our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements. For additional information, see Trading Risk Management Trading Portfolio Stress Testing in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book The following discussion presents net interest income for banking book activities. For additional information, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Table 45 presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . Table 45 Forward Rates June 30, 2019 Federal Funds Three-month LIBOR 10-Year Swap Spot rates 2.50 % 2.32 % 1.96 % 12-month forward rates 1.50 1.62 1.99 December 31, 2018 Spot rates 2.50 % 2.81 % 2.71 % 12-month forward rates 2.50 2.64 2.75 Table 46 shows the pretax impact to forecasted net interest income over the next 12 months from June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , resulting from instantaneous parallel and non-parallel shocks to the market-based forward curve. Periodically we evaluate the scenarios presented so that they are meaningful in the context of the current rate environment. In the six months ended June 30, 2019 , the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet increased primarily due to decreases in interest rates. We continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel move in interest rates with the majority of that impact coming from the short end of the yield curve. Additionally, higher interest rates impact the fair value of debt securities and, accordingly, for debt 45 Bank of America securities classified as AFS, may adversely affect accumulated OCI and thus capital levels under the Basel 3 capital rules. Under instantaneous upward parallel shifts, the near-term adverse impact to Basel 3 capital is reduced over time by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income. For more information on Basel 3, see Capital Management Regulatory Capital on page 22 . Table 46 Estimated Banking Book Net Interest Income Sensitivity to Curve Changes Short Rate (bps) Long Rate (bps) June 30 2019 December 31 2018 (Dollars in millions) Parallel Shifts +100 bps instantaneous shift +100 +100 $ 4,081 $ 2,833 -100 bps instantaneous shift -100 -100 (5,865 ) (4,280 ) Flatteners Short-end instantaneous change +100 2,555 2,158 Long-end instantaneous change -100 (2,778 ) (1,618 ) Steepeners Short-end instantaneous change -100 (3,048 ) (2,648 ) Long-end instantaneous change +100 1,539 675 The sensitivity analysis in Table 46 assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates. As part of our ALM activities, we use securities, certain residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity. The behavior of our deposits portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income. The sensitivity analysis in Table 46 assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce our benefit in those scenarios. Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative Contracts Interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts are utilized in our ALM activities and serve as an efficient tool to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk. We use derivatives to hedge the variability in cash flows or changes in fair value on our balance sheet due to interest rate and foreign exchange components. For more information on our hedging activities, see Note 3 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . For more information on interest rate contracts and risk management, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . We use interest rate derivative instruments to hedge the variability in the cash flows of our assets and liabilities and other forecasted transactions (collectively referred to as cash flow hedges). The net losses on both open and terminated cash flow hedge derivative instruments recorded in accumulated OCI were $604 million and $1.3 billion , on a pretax basis, at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . These net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the same period as the hedged cash flows affect earnings and will decrease income or increase expense on the respective hedged cash flows. Assuming no change in open cash flow derivative hedge positions and no changes in prices or interest rates beyond what is implied in forward yield curves at June 30, 2019 , the pretax net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings as follows: 23 percent within the next year, 42 percent in years two through five and 19 percent in years six through ten, with the remaining 16 percent thereafter. For more information on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, see Note 3 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . We hedge our net investment in non-U.S. operations determined to have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar using forward foreign exchange contracts that typically settle in less than 180 days, cross-currency basis swaps and foreign exchange options. We recorded net after-tax losses on derivatives in accumulated OCI associated with net investment hedges which were offset by gains on our net investments in consolidated non-U.S. entities at June 30, 2019 . Table 47 presents derivatives utilized in our ALM activities and shows the notional amount, fair value, weighted-average receive-fixed and pay-fixed rates, expected maturity and average estimated durations of our open ALM derivatives at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . These amounts do not include derivative hedges on our MSRs. During the six months ended June 30, 2019 , the fair value of receive-fixed interest rate swaps increased while pay-fixed interest rates swaps decreased, driven by lower swap rates.

(5) The notional amount of foreign exchange contracts of $(99.7) billion at June 30, 2019 was comprised of $28.6 billion in foreign currency-denominated and cross-currency receive-fixed swaps, $(127.0) billion in net foreign currency forward rate contracts, $(2.1) billion in foreign currency-denominated pay-fixed swaps and $768 million in net foreign currency futures contracts. Foreign exchange contracts of $(8.4) billion at December 31, 2018 were comprised of $25.2 billion in foreign currency-denominated and cross-currency receive-fixed swaps, $(32.7) billion in net foreign currency forward rate contracts, $(1.8) billion in foreign currency-denominated pay-fixed swaps and $814 million in foreign currency futures contracts. (6) Reflects the net of long and short positions. Amounts shown as negative reflect a net short position. Mortgage Banking Risk Management We originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. We determine whether loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate. Changes in interest rates impact the value of interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and the related residential mortgage loans held for sale (LHFS), as well as the value of the MSRs. Because the interest rate risks of these hedged items offset, we combine them into one overall hedged item with one combined economic hedge portfolio consisting of derivative contracts and securities. For more information on IRLCs and the related residential mortgage LHFS, see Mortgage Banking Risk Management in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . During the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 , we recorded gains of $78 million and $139 million related to the change in fair value of the MSRs, IRLCs and LHFS, net of gains and losses on the hedge portfolio, compared to gains of $60 million and $129 million for the same periods in 2018. For more information on MSRs, see Note 15 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements . 47 Bank of America Complex Accounting Estimates Our significant accounting principles are essential in understanding the MD&A. Many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments. For additional information, see Complex Accounting Estimates in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Goodwill and Intangible Assets We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of June 30, 2019 for all of our reporting units that had goodwill. Based on the results of the annual goodwill impairment test, we determined there was no impairment. For more information, see Note 8 Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements . The nature of and accounting for goodwill and intangible assets are discussed in the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 8 Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements and in Complex Accounting Estimates of the MD&A.
