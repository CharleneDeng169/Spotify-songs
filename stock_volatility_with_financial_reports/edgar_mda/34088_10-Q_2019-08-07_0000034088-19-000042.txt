Basis of Financial Statement Preparation These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in the context of the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the Corporation's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the opinion of the Corporation, the information furnished herein reflects all known accruals and adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the periods reported herein. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. Prior data has been reclassified in certain cases to conform to the current presentation basis. The Corporation's exploration and production activities are accounted for under the "successful efforts" method. 2. Accounting Changes Effective January 1, 2019, the Corporation adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board Standard, Leases (Topic 842) , as amended. The standard requires all leases to be recorded on the balance sheet as a right of use asset and a lease liability. The Corporation used a transition method that applies the new lease standard at January 1, 2019. The Corporation applied a policy election to exclude short-term leases from balance sheet recognition and also elected certain practical expedients at adoption. As permitted, the Corporation did not reassess whether existing contracts are or contain leases, the lease classification for any existing leases, initial direct costs for any existing lease and whether existing land easements and rights of way, which were not previously accounted for as leases, are or contain a lease. At adoption on January 1, 2019, an operating lease liability of $ 3.3 billion was recorded and the operating lease right of use asset was $ 4.3 billion, including $ 1.0 billion of previously recorded prepaid leases. There was no cumulative earnings effect adjustment. Effective January 1, 2020, ExxonMobil will adopt the Financial Accounting Standards Board update, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326) , as amended. The standard requires a valuation allowance for credit losses be recognized for certain financial assets that reflects the current expected credit loss over the asset contractual life. The valuation allowance considers the risk of loss, even if remote, and considers past events, current conditions and expectations of the future. The Corporation is evaluating the standard and its effect on the Corporation financial statements. 3. Litigation and Other Contingencies Litigation A variety of claims have been made against ExxonMobil and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending lawsuits. Management has regular litigation reviews, including updates from corporate and outside counsel, to assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. The Corporation accrues an undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. The Corporation does not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote. For contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and which are significant, the Corporation discloses the nature of the contingency and, where feasible, an estimate of the possible loss. For purposes of our contingency disclosures, significant includes material matters, as well as other matters which management believes should be disclosed. ExxonMobil will continue to defend itself vigorously in these matters. Based on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances, the Corporation does not believe the ultimate outcome of any currently pending lawsuit against ExxonMobil will have a material adverse effect upon the Corporation's operations, financial condition, or financial statements taken as a whole. Other Contingencies The Corporation and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries were contingently liable at June 30, 2019, for guarantees relating to notes, loans and performance under contracts. Where guarantees for environmental remediation and other similar matters do not include a stated cap, the amounts reflect management estimate of the maximum potential exposure. These guarantees are not reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Corporation financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 9 As of June 30, 2019 Equity Other Company Third Party Obligations (1) Obligations Total (millions of dollars) Guarantees Debt-related 641 83 724 Other 855 4,674 5,529 Total 1,496 4,757 6,253 (1) ExxonMobil share Additionally, the Corporation and its affiliates have numerous long-term sales and purchase commitments in their various business activities, all of which are expected to be fulfilled with no adverse consequences material to the Corporation operations or financial condition. The operations and earnings of the Corporation and its affiliates throughout the world have been, and may in the future be, affected from time to time in varying degree by political developments and laws and regulations, such as forced divestiture of assets; restrictions on production, imports and exports; price controls; tax increases and retroactive tax claims; expropriation of property; cancellation of contract rights and environmental regulations. Both the likelihood of such occurrences and their overall effect upon the Corporation vary greatly from country to country and are not predictable. In accordance with a Venezuelan nationalization decree issued in February 2007, a subsidiary of the Venezuelan National Oil Company (PdVSA) assumed the operatorship of the Cerro Negro Heavy Oil Project. The decree also required conversion of the Cerro Negro Project into a mixed enterprise and an increase in PdVSA or one of its affiliate ownership interest in the Project. ExxonMobil refused to accede to the terms proffered by the government, and on June 27, 2007, the government expropriated ExxonMobil 41.67 percent interest in the Cerro Negro Project. ExxonMobil collected awards of $ 908 million in an arbitration against PdVSA under the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce in respect of an indemnity related to the Cerro Negro Project and $ 260 million in an arbitration for compensation due for the La Ceiba Project and for export curtailments at the Cerro Negro Project under rules of International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). An ICSID arbitration award relating to the Cerro Negro Project expropriation ($ 1.4 billion) was annulled based on a determination that a prior Tribunal failed to adequately explain why the cap on damages in the indemnity owed by PdVSA did not affect or limit the amount owed for the expropriation of the Cerro Negro Project. ExxonMobil filed a new claim seeking to restore the original award of damages for the Cerro Negro Project with ICSID on September 26, 2018. The net impact of this matter on the Corporation consolidated financial results cannot be reasonably estimated. Regardless, the Corporation does not expect the resolution to have a material effect upon the Corporation operations or financial condition. An affiliate of ExxonMobil is one of the Contractors under a Production Sharing Contract (PSC) with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) covering the Erha block located in the offshore waters of Nigeria. ExxonMobil's affiliate is the operator of the block and owns a 56.25 percent interest under the PSC. The Contractors are in dispute with NNPC regarding NNPC's lifting of crude oil in excess of its entitlement under the terms of the PSC. In accordance with the terms of the PSC, the Contractors initiated arbitration in Abuja, Nigeria, under the Nigerian Arbitration and Conciliation Act. On October 24, 2011, a three-member arbitral Tribunal issued an award upholding the Contractors' position in all material respects and awarding damages to the Contractors jointly in an amount of approximately $ 1.8 billion plus $ 234 million in accrued interest. The Contractors petitioned a Nigerian federal court for enforcement of the award, and NNPC petitioned the same court to have the award set aside. On May 22, 2012, the court set aside the award. The Contractors appealed that judgment to the Court of Appeal, Abuja Judicial Division. On July 22, 2016, the Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the lower court setting aside the award. On October 21, 2016, the Contractors appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of Nigeria. In June 2013, the Contractors filed a lawsuit against NNPC in the Nigerian federal high court in order to preserve their ability to seek enforcement of the PSC in the courts if necessary. Following dismissal by this court, the Contractors appealed to the Nigerian Court of Appeal in June 2016. In October 2014, the Contractors filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to enforce, if necessary, the arbitration award against NNPC assets residing within that jurisdiction. NNPC has moved to dismiss the lawsuit. At this time, the net impact of this matter on the Corporation's consolidated financial results cannot be reasonably estimated. However, regardless of the outcome of enforcement proceedings, the Corporation does not expect the proceedings to have a material effect upon the Corporation's operations or financial condition. 10 4.

The fair value is calculated by discounting the remaining obligations by a rate consistent with the credit quality and industry of the equity company. 13 Derivative Instruments. The Corporation size, strong capital structure, geographic diversity and the complementary nature of the Upstream, Downstream and Chemical businesses reduce the Corporation enterprise-wide risk from changes in commodity prices, currency rates and interest rates. In addition, the Corporation uses commodity-based contracts, including derivatives, to manage commodity price risk and for trading purposes. Commodity contracts held for trading purposes are presented in the Consolidated Statement of Income on a net basis in the line Sales and other operating revenue. The Corporation commodity derivatives are not accounted for under hedge accounting. At times, the Corporation also enters into currency and interest rate derivatives, none of which are material to the Corporation financial position as of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, or results of operations for the periods ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. Credit risk associated with the Corporation derivative position is mitigated by several factors, including the use of derivative clearing exchanges and the quality of and financial limits placed on derivative counterparties. The Corporation maintains a system of controls that includes the authorization, reporting and monitoring of derivative activity. At June 30, 2019, the net notional long/(short) position of derivative instruments was ( 20 ) million barrels for crude oil, ( 44 ) million barrels for products, and ( 140 ) million MMBtus of natural gas. At December 31, 2018, the net notional long/(short) position of derivative instruments was ( 19 ) million barrels for crude oil and ( 9 ) million barrels for products. Realized and unrealized gains/(losses) on derivative instruments that were recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income are included in the following lines on a before-tax basis: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 (millions of dollars) Sales and other operating revenue 33 ( 11 ) ( 242 ) ( 3 ) Crude oil and product purchases 33 ( 193 ) 15 ( 274 ) Total 66 ( 204 ) ( 227 ) ( 277 ) 14 8.

Leases The Corporation and its consolidated affiliates generally purchase the property, plant and equipment used in operations, but there are situations where assets are leased, primarily for drilling equipment, tankers, office buildings, railcars, and other moveable equipment. Right of use assets and lease liabilities are established on the balance sheet for leases with an expected term greater than one year, by discounting the amounts fixed in the lease agreement for the duration of the lease which is reasonably certain, considering the probability of exercising any early termination and extension options. The portion of the fixed payment related to service costs for drilling equipment and tankers is excluded from the calculation of right of use assets and lease liabilities. Generally assets are leased only for a portion of their useful lives, and are accounted for as operating leases. In limited situations assets are leased for nearly all of their useful lives, and are accounted for as finance leases. Variable payments under these lease agreements are not significant. Residual value guarantees, restrictions, or covenants related to leases, and transactions with related parties are also not significant. In general, leases are capitalized using the incremental borrowing rate of the leasing affiliate. The Corporation activities as a lessor are not significant. At adoption of the lease accounting change (see Note 2), on January 1, 2019, an operating lease liability of $ 3.3 billion was recorded and the operating lease right of use asset was $ 4.3 billion, including $ 1.0 billion of previously recorded prepaid leases. There was no cumulative earnings effect adjustment.

Unless otherwise indicated, references to earnings, Upstream, Downstream, Chemical and Corporate and financing segment earnings, and earnings per share are ExxonMobil's share after excluding amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests. REVIEW OF SECOND QUARTER 2019 RESULTS ExxonMobil second quarter 2019 earnings were $3.1 billion, or $0.73 per diluted share, compared with $4.0 billion a year earlier. The decrease in earnings was primarily the result of lower Upstream realizations, weaker Downstream and Chemical margins, higher scheduled maintenance activity, and increased expenses. These impacts were partly offset by volume growth and favorable one-time items. Earnings of $5.5 billion for the first six months of 2019 were down 36 percent from $8.6 billion in 2018. Earnings per share assuming dilution were $1.28. Capital and exploration expenditures were $15.0 billion, up 30 percent from 2018. Oil-equivalent production was 3.9 million barrels per day, up 5 percent from the prior year. Excluding entitlement effects and divestments, oil-equivalent production was also up 5 percent. The Corporation distributed $7.2 billion in dividends to shareholders. 20 Second Quarter First Six Months 2019 2018 2019 2018 (millions of dollars) Upstream earnings United States 335 439 431 868 Non-U.S. 2,926 2,601 5,706 5,669 Total 3,261 3,040 6,137 6,537 Upstream earnings were $3,261 million in the second quarter of 2019, up $221 million from the second quarter of 2018. Lower realizations reduced earnings by $730 million. Higher volume and mix effects increased earnings by $720 million due to higher liquids volumes of $590 million and increased gas volumes of $130 million. All other items increased earnings by $230 million due to a favorable one-time tax item of $487 million, partly offset by higher expenses. U.S. Upstream earnings were $335 million, down $104 million from the prior year quarter. Non-U.S. Upstream earnings were $2,926 million, up $325 million from the prior year quarter. On an oil-equivalent basis, production increased 7 percent from the second quarter of 2018. Liquids production totaled 2.4 million barrels per day, up 177,000 barrels per day as growth and lower downtime were partly offset by decline. Natural gas production was 9.1 billion cubic feet per day, up 507 million cubic feet per day driven by growth and higher demand, partly offset by decline. Upstream earnings were $6,137 million in the first six months of 2019, down $400 million from the first six months of 2018. Realizations reduced earnings by $760 million, mainly due to lower liquids realizations. Higher volume and mix effects increased earnings by $790 million mainly due to higher liquids volumes. All other items decreased earnings by $430 million as higher expenses and the absence of asset management gains were partly offset by a favorable one-time tax item. U.S. Upstream earnings were $431 million, down $437 million from the prior year. Non-U.S. Upstream earnings were $5,706 million, up $37 million from the prior year. On an oil-equivalent basis, production increased 5 percent from the first six months of 2018. Liquids production totaled 2.4 million barrels per day, up 144,000 barrels per day due to growth and lower downtime, partly offset by decline. Natural gas production was 9.5 billion cubic feet per day, up 199 million cubic feet per day, as growth and lower downtime were partly offset by decline. 21 Second Quarter First Six Months Upstream additional information (thousands of barrels daily) Volumes reconciliation (Oil-equivalent production) (1) 2018 3,647 3,768 Entitlements - Net Interest - - Entitlements - Price / Spend / Other 20 14 Quotas - - Divestments (9) (17) Growth / Other 251 180 2019 3,909 3,945 (1) Natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six million cubic feet per one thousand barrels. Listed below are descriptions of ExxonMobil volumes reconciliation factors which are provided to facilitate understanding of the terms. Entitlements - Net Interest are changes to ExxonMobil share of production volumes caused by non-operational changes to volume-determining factors. These factors consist of net interest changes specified in Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) which typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity upon achieving pay-out in partner investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. Once a net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices. Entitlements - Price, Spend and Other are changes to ExxonMobil share of production volumes resulting from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. These factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one period to another. According to the terms of contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. For example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for ExxonMobil to recover its costs. These effects generally vary from period to period with field spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. Such factors can also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific provisions in production agreements. Quotas are changes in ExxonMobil allowable production arising from production constraints imposed by countries which are members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Volumes reported in this category would have been readily producible in the absence of the quota. Divestments are reductions in ExxonMobil production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other economic consideration. Growth and Other factors comprise all other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above definitions that may affect volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. Such factors include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project and work program activities, acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges, downtime, market demand, natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial terms that do not affect entitlements. 22 Second Quarter First Six Months 2019 2018 2019 2018 (millions of dollars) Downstream earnings United States 310 695 149 1,014 Non-U.S. 141 29 46 650 Total 451 724 195 1,664 Downstream earnings were $451 million in the second quarter of 2019, down $273 million from the second quarter of 2018.

Weaker margins reduced earnings by $440 million. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $10 million. All other items decreased earnings by $270 million mainly due to higher expenses. U.S. Chemical earnings were ($6) million, down $459 million from the prior year quarter. Non-U.S. Chemical earnings were $194 million, down $243 million from the prior year quarter. Second quarter prime product sales of 6.7 million metric tons were 153,000 metric tons lower than the prior year quarter.

Cash flow from operations and asset sales in the second quarter of 2019 was $6.0 billion, including asset sales of $33 million, a decrease of $2.1 billion from the comparable 2018 period primarily reflecting lower earnings and asset sale proceeds. Cash provided by operating activities totaled $14.3 billion for the first six months of 2019, $2.0 billion lower than 2018. The major source of funds was net income including noncontrolling interests of $5.8 billion, a decrease of $3.0 billion from the prior year period. The adjustment for the noncash provision of $9.2 billion for depreciation and depletion was up $0.1 billion from 2018. Changes in operational working capital contributed $1.0 billion, compared to a decrease of $1.0 billion in the prior year period. All other items net decreased cash flows by $1.7 billion in 2019 versus a reduction of $0.5 billion in 2018. See the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for additional details. Investing activities for the first six months of 2019 used net cash of $12.7 billion, an increase of $5.7 billion compared to the prior year. Spending for additions to property, plant and equipment of $11.4 billion was $3.1 billion higher than 2018. Proceeds from asset sales of $0.1 billion decreased $1.6 billion.

Internally generated funds are generally expected to cover financial requirements, supplemented by short-term and long-term debt as required. The Corporation, as part of its ongoing asset management program, continues to evaluate its mix of assets for potential upgrade. Because of the ongoing nature of this program, dispositions will continue to be made from time to time which will result in either gains or losses. Additionally, the Corporation continues to evaluate opportunities to enhance its business portfolio through acquisitions of assets or companies, and enters into such transactions from time to time. Key criteria for evaluating acquisitions include potential for future growth and attractive current valuations. Acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the Corporation common stock, or both. Litigation and other contingencies are discussed in Note 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

In the United States, the Corporation has various ongoing U.S. federal income tax positions at issue with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax years beginning in 2006. The IRS has asserted penalties associated with several of those positions. The Corporation has not recognized the penalties as an expense because the Corporation does not expect the penalties to be sustained under applicable law. The Corporation has filed a refund suit for tax years 2006-2009 in a U.S. federal district court with respect to the positions at issue for those years. The trial for those tax issues was completed at the end of June and the Corporation is awaiting a decision. Unfavorable resolution of all positions at issue with the IRS would not have a materially adverse effect on the Corporation net income or liquidity. 26 CAPITAL AND EXPLORATION EXPENDITURES Second Quarter First Six Months 2019 2018 2019 2018 (millions of dollars) Upstream (including exploration expenses) 6,242 4,855 11,603 8,614 Downstream 1,113 1,230 1,942 1,844 Chemical 718 533 1,414 998 Other 6 9 10 38 Total 8,079 6,627 14,969 11,494 Capital and exploration expenditures in the second quarter of 2019 were $8.1 billion, up 22 percent from the second quarter of 2018.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Effective January 1, 2020, ExxonMobil will adopt the Financial Accounting Standards Board update, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326) , as amended. The standard requires a valuation allowance for credit losses be recognized for certain financial assets that reflects the current expected credit loss over the asset contractual life. The valuation allowance considers the risk of loss, even if remote, and considers past events, current conditions and expectations of the future. The Corporation is evaluating the standard and its effect on the Corporation financial statements.
