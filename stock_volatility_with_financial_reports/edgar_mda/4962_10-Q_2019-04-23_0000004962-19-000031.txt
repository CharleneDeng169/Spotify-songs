Basis of Presentation The Company We are a globally integrated payments company that provides customers with access to products, insights and experiences that enrich lives and build business success. Our principal products and services are charge and credit card products and travel-related services offered to consumers and businesses around the world. Business travel-related services are offered through the non-consolidated joint venture, American Express Global Business Travel (the GBT JV). Our various products and services are sold globally to diverse customer groups, including consumers, small businesses, mid-sized companies and large corporations. These products and services are sold through various channels, including mobile and online applications, direct mail, in-house sales teams, third-party vendors and direct response advertising. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 (the 2018 Form 10-K). If not materially different, certain note disclosures included therein have been omitted from these Consolidated Financial Statements. The interim consolidated financial information in this report has not been audited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, which consist of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the interim period consolidated financial information, have been made. Results of operations reported for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire year. The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. These accounting estimates reflect the best judgment of management, but actual results could differ. Certain reclassifications of prior period amounts have been made to conform to the current period presentation. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new accounting guidance for the recognition of credit losses on financial instruments, effective January 1, 2020. The guidance introduces a new credit reserving model known as the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) model, which is based on expected losses, and differs significantly from the incurred loss approach used today. The CECL model requires measurement of expected credit losses not only based on historical experience and current conditions, but also by including reasonable and supportable forecasts incorporating forward-looking information. In addition, for available-for-sale debt securities, the new guidance replaces the other-than-temporary impairment model, and requires the recognition of an allowance for reductions in a security fair value attributable to declines in credit quality, instead of a direct write-down of the security, when a valuation decline is determined to be other-than-temporary. The guidance also requires a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the reporting period of adoption. We continue to evaluate the impact the new guidance will have on our financial position, results of operations and regulatory risk-based capital. The CECL model will alter the assumptions used in estimating credit losses on Card Member loans and receivables, and we may have material changes to our credit reserves as the new guidance involves earlier recognition of expected losses for the life of the assets. However, the extent of the impact will depend on the characteristics of our loan portfolio, macroeconomic conditions and forecasted information at the date of adoption. We continue to drive our cross-functional implementation efforts and have substantially completed development of CECL models. Continuing through 2019, we are validating and analyzing model output during CECL parallel runs, and developing the business processes, policies and controls that satisfy the requirements of the new standard. 6 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In February 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on leases. The accounting standard, effective January 1, 2019, requires virtually all leases to be recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Effective January 1, 2019, we adopted the standard using the modified retrospective method, under which we elected the package of practical expedients and transition provisions allowing us to bring our existing operating leases onto the Consolidated Balance Sheet without adjusting comparative periods. Under the guidance we have also elected not to separate lease and non-lease components in recognition of the lease-related assets and liabilities, as well as the related lease expense. We have operating leases for facilities and equipment, which are recorded as assets and liabilities for those leases with terms greater than 12 months. Lease-related assets, or right-of-use assets, are recognized at the lease commencement date at amounts equal to the respective lease liabilities, adjusted for prepaid lease payments, initial direct costs, and lease incentives received. Lease-related liabilities are recognized at the present value of the remaining contractual fixed lease payments, discounted using our incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, while variable lease payments are expensed as incurred. Upon adoption of the standard, we recorded approximately $700 million of right of use assets and lease-related liabilities, included in Other assets and Other liabilities, respectively. In conjunction with the adoption, we upgraded our lease administration software and updated our business processes and internal controls in support of the new guidance. In February 2018, as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act), the FASB issued new accounting guidance on the reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) to retained earnings. We adopted the new guidance effective January 1, 2019 and did not elect the optional reclassification. 2. Business Events During the first quarter of 2018, we acquired the portion of the Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. cobrand credit card loan portfolio that we did not previously own (the acquired Hilton portfolio). The acquired Hilton portfolio had an outstanding principal and interest balance of approximately $1 billion at acquisition. None of the credit card loans acquired were considered purchased credit impaired at acquisition date. The cash outflows related to this acquisition are reported within the investing section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows primarily as an increase in Card Member receivables and loans. 7 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 3. Loans and Accounts Receivable Our lending and charge payment card products result in the generation of Card Member loans and Card Member receivables, respectively.

Other receivables are presented net of r eserves for losses of $25 million as of both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. 8 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Card Member Loans and Card Member Receivables Aging Generally, a Card Member account is considered past due if payment is not received within 30 days after the billing statement date. The following table presents the aging of Card Member loans and receivables as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018: 2019 (Millions) Current 30-59 Days Past Due 60-89 Days Past Due 90+ Days Past Due Total Card Member Loans: Global Consumer Services Group $ 66,916 $ 286 $ 216 $ 520 $ 67,938 Global Commercial Services Global Small Business Services 12,824 53 38 76 12,991 Global Corporate Payments (a) (b) (b) (b) 66 Card Member Receivables: Global Consumer Services Group 19,667 85 58 119 19,929 Global Commercial Services Global Small Business Services $ 17,061 $ 105 $ 62 $ 119 $ 17,347 Global Corporate Payments (a) (b) (b) (b) $ 125 $ 19,559 2018 (Millions) Current 30-59 Days Past Due 60-89 Days Past Due 90+ Days Past Due Total Card Member Loans: Global Consumer Services Group $ 68,442 $ 290 $ 220 $ 506 $ 69,458 Global Commercial Services Global Small Business Services 12,195 51 32 73 12,351 Global Corporate Payments (a) (b) (b) (b) 45 Card Member Receivables: Global Consumer Services Group 21,207 80 50 118 21,455 Global Commercial Services Global Small Business Services $ 16,460 $ 101 $ 53 $ 114 $ 16,728 Global Corporate Payments (a) (b) (b) (b) $ 129 $ 17,710 (a) For Global Corporate Payments Card Member loans and receivables in Global Commercial Services (GCS), delinquency data is tracked based on days past billing status rather than days past due. A Card Member account is considered 90 days past billing if payment has not been received within 90 days of the Card Member billing statement date. In addition, if we initiate collection procedures on an account prior to the account becoming 90 days past billing, the associated Card Member loan or receivable balance is classified as 90 days past billing. These amounts are shown above as 90+ Days Past Due for presentation purposes. See also (b). (b) Delinquency data for periods other than 90+ days past billing is not available due to system constraints. Therefore, such data has not been utilized for risk management purposes. The balances that are current to 89 days past due can be derived as the difference between the Total and the 90+ Days Past Due balances. 9 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Credit Quality Indicators for Card Member Loans and Receivables The following tables present the key credit quality indicators as of or for the three months ended March 31: 2019 2018 Net Write-Off Rate Net Write-Off Rate Principal Only (a) Principal, Interest & Fees (a) 30+ Days Past Due as a % of Total Principal Only (a) Principal, Interest & Fees (a) 30+ Days Past Due as a % of Total Card Member Loans: Global Consumer Services Group 2.3 % 2.8 % 1.5 % 2.0 % 2.4 % 1.4 % Global Small Business Services 1.8 % 2.1 % 1.3 % 1.6 % 1.9 % 1.3 % Card Member Receivables: Global Consumer Services Group 1.7 % 1.9 % 1.3 % 1.6 % 1.7 % 1.4 % Global Small Business Services 1.9 % 2.1 % 1.6 % 1.7 % 1.9 % 1.8 % 2019 2018 Net Loss Ratio as a % of Charge Volume 90+ Days Past Billing as a % of Receivables Net Loss Ratio as a % of Charge Volume 90+ Days Past Billing as a % of Receivables Card Member Receivables: Global Corporate Payments 0.08 % 0.6 % 0.10 % 0.8 % (a) We present a net write-off rate based on principal losses only (i.e., excluding interest and/or fees) to be consistent with industry convention.

Investment Securities Investment securities principally include available-for-sale debt securities carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with unrealized gains and losses recorded in AOCI, net of income taxes. Realized gains and losses are recognized upon disposition of the securities using the specific identification method. Investment securities also include equity securities carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The unrealized gains and losses on equity securities are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The following is a summary of investment securities as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018: 2019 2018 Gross Gross Estimated Gross Gross Estimated Description of Securities Unrealized Unrealized Fair Unrealized Unrealized Fair (Millions) Cost Gains Losses Value Cost Gains Losses Value Available-for-sale debt securities: State and municipal obligations $ 342 $ 6 $ (1 ) $ 347 $ 594 $ 4 $ (2 ) $ 596 U.S. Government agency obligations 10 10 10 10 U.S. Government treasury obligations 5,404 14 (9 ) 5,409 3,452 5 (17 ) 3,440 Corporate debt securities 29 29 28 28 Mortgage-backed securities (a) 48 1 49 50 1 51 Foreign government bonds and obligations 565 1 566 474 474 Equity securities (b) 50 (3 ) 47 51 (3 ) 48 Total $ 6,448 $ 22 $ (13 ) $ 6,457 $ 4,659 $ 10 $ (22 ) $ 4,647 (a) Represents mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae.

The following table provides information about our investment securities with gross unrealized losses and the length of time that individual securities have been in an unrealized loss position as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018: 2019 2018 Less than 12 months 12 months or more Less than 12 months 12 months or more Gross Gross Gross Gross Description of Securities (Millions) Estimated Fair Value Unrealized Losses Estimated Fair Value Unrealized Losses Estimated Fair Value Unrealized Losses Estimated Fair Value Unrealized Losses State and municipal obligations $ $ $ 52 $ (1 ) $ $ $ 82 $ (1 ) U.S. Government treasury obligations 998 (9 ) 224 (2 ) 791 (15 ) Total $ $ $ 1,050 $ (10 ) $ 224 $ (2 ) $ 873 $ (16 ) 15 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) The following table summarizes the gross unrealized losses due to temporary impairments by ratio of fair value to amortized cost as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018: Less than 12 months 12 months or more Total Ratio of Fair Value to Gross Gross Gross Amortized Cost Number of Estimated Unrealized Number of Estimated Unrealized Number of Estimated Unrealized (Dollars in millions) Securities Fair Value Losses Securities Fair Value Losses Securities Fair Value Losses 2019: 90% 100% $ $ 26 $ 1,050 $ (10 ) 26 $ 1,050 $ (10 ) Total as of March 31, 2019 $ $ 26 $ 1,050 $ (10 ) 26 $ 1,050 $ (10 ) 2018: 90% 100% 2 $ 224 $ (2 ) 29 $ 873 $ (16 ) 31 $ 1,097 $ (18 ) Total as of December 31, 2018 2 $ 224 $ (2 ) 29 $ 873 $ (16 ) 31 $ 1,097 $ (18 ) The gross unrealized losses for available-for-sale debt securities are attributed to wider credit spreads for specific issuers, adverse changes in benchmark interest rates, or a combination thereof, all compared to those prevailing when the investment securities were purchased. Overall, for the available-for-sale debt securities in gross unrealized loss positions, (i) we do not intend to sell the securities, (ii) it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the securities before recovery of the unrealized losses, and (iii) we expect that the contractual principal and interest will be received on the securities. As a result, we recognized no other-than-temporary impairment during the periods presented. Contractual maturities for investment securities with stated maturities as of March 31, 2019 were as follows: Estimated (Millions) Cost Fair Value Due within 1 year $ 4,599 $ 4,600 Due after 1 year but within 5 years 1,315 1,319 Due after 5 years but within 10 years 179 181 Due after 10 years 305 310 Total $ 6,398 $ 6,410 The expected payments on state and municipal obligations and mortgage-backed securities may not coincide with their contractual maturities because the issuers have the right to call or prepay certain obligations. 16 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 6. Asset Securitizations We periodically securitize Card Member loans and receivables arising from our card businesses through the transfer of those assets to securitization trusts, American Express Credit Account Master Trust (the Lending Trust) and American Express Issuance Trust II (the Charge Trust and together with the Lending Trust, the Trusts). The Trusts then issue debt securities collateralized by the transferred assets to third-party investors. The Trusts are considered VIEs as they have insufficient equity at risk to finance their activities, which are to issue debt securities that are collateralized by the underlying Card Member loans and receivables. We perform the servicing and key decision making for the Trusts, and therefore have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the Trusts economic performance, which are the collection of the underlying Card Member loans and receivables. In addition, we hold all of the variable interests in both Trusts, with the exception of the debt securities issued to third-party investors. As of March 31, 2019 , our ownership of variable interests was $12.3 billion and $7.8 billion for the Lending Trust and the Charge Trust, respectively. These variable interests held by us provide us with the right to receive benefits and the obligation to absorb losses, which could be significant to both the Lending Trust and the Charge Trust. Based on these considerations, we are the primary beneficiary of the Trusts and therefore consolidate the Trusts. The following table provides information on the restricted cash held by the Trusts as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets: (Millions) 2019 2018 Lending Trust $ 83 $ 67 Charge Trust 1 3 Total $ 84 $ 70 These amounts relate to collections of Card Member loans and receivables to be used by the Trusts to fund future expenses and obligations, including interest on debt securities, credit losses and upcoming debt maturities. Under the respective terms of the Lending Trust and the Charge Trust agreements, the occurrence of certain triggering events associated with the performance of the assets of each Trust could result in payment of trust expenses, establishment of reserve funds, or, in a worst-case scenario, early amortization of debt securities. During the three months ended March 31, 2019 and the year ended December 31, 2018, no such triggering events occurred. 17 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 7.

Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we and our subsidiaries are subject to various pending and potential legal actions, arbitration proceedings, claims, investigations, examinations, information gathering requests, subpoenas, inquiries and matters relating to compliance with laws and regulations (collectively, legal proceedings). Based on our current knowledge, and taking into consideration our litigation-related liabilities, we do not believe we are a party to, nor are any of our properties the subject of, any legal proceeding that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or liquidity. However, in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters, including the fact that some pending legal proceedings are at preliminary stages or seek an indeterminate amount of damages, it is possible that the outcome of legal proceedings could have a material impact on our results of operations. Certain legal proceedings involving us or our subsidiaries are described below. Individual merchant cases and a putative merchant class action, which were consolidated in 2011 and collectively captioned In re: American Express Anti-Steering Rules Antitrust Litigation (II) in the Eastern District of New York, alleged that provisions in our merchant agreements prohibiting merchants from differentially surcharging our cards or steering a customer to use another network card or another type of general-purpose card ( anti-steering and non-discrimination contractual provisions) violate U.S. antitrust laws. Following the Supreme Court decision in Ohio v. American Express Co. in favor of American Express, plaintiffs in both the individual merchant cases and the putative merchant class action filed amended complaints. On April 12, 2019, the individual merchant cases were dismissed with prejudice pursuant to a joint stipulation between the parties. Our motion to dismiss and compel arbitration of the class action is pending. In July 2004, we were named as a defendant in another putative class action filed in the Southern District of New York and subsequently transferred to the Eastern District of New York, captioned The Marcus Corporation v. American Express Co., et al. , in which the plaintiffs allege an unlawful antitrust tying arrangement between certain of our charge cards and credit cards in violation of various state and federal laws. The plaintiffs in this action seek injunctive relief and an unspecified amount of damages. On March 8, 2016, plaintiffs B&R Supermarket, Inc. d/b/a Milam Market and Grove Liquors LLC, on behalf of themselves and others, filed a suit, captioned B&R Supermarket, Inc. d/b/a Milam Market, et al. v. Visa Inc., et al. , for violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act, the Clayton Antitrust Act, California Cartwright Act and unjust enrichment in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, against American Express Company, other credit and charge card networks, other issuing banks and EMVCo, LLC. Plaintiffs allege that the defendants, through EMVCo, conspired to shift liability for fraudulent, faulty and otherwise rejected consumer credit card transactions from themselves to merchants after the implementation of EMV chip payment terminals. Plaintiffs seek damages and injunctive relief. An amended complaint was filed on July 15, 2016. On September 30, 2016, the court denied our motion to dismiss as to claims brought by merchants who do not accept American Express cards, and on May 4, 2017, the California court transferred the case to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. On July 30, 2015, plaintiff Plumbers and Steamfitters Local 137 Pension Fund, on behalf of themselves and other purchasers of American Express stock, filed a suit, captioned Plumbers and Steamfitters Local 137 Pension Fund v. American Express Co., Kenneth I. Chenault and Jeffrey C. Campbell , in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York for violation of federal securities law, alleging that the Company deliberately issued false and misleading statements to, and omitted important information from, the public relating to the financial importance of the Costco cobrand relationship to the Company, including, but not limited to, the decision to accelerate negotiations to renew the cobrand agreement. The plaintiff sought damages and injunctive relief. On October 2, 2017, the Court granted defendants motion to dismiss the plaintiff amended complaint. The plaintiff has appealed the court decision. We are being challenged in a number of countries regarding our application of value-added taxes (VAT) to certain of our international transactions, which are in various stages of audit, or are being contested in legal actions. While we believe we have complied with all applicable tax laws, rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions, the tax authorities may determine that we owe additional VAT. In certain jurisdictions where we are contesting the assessments, we were required to pay the VAT assessments prior to contesting. Our legal proceedings range from cases brought by a single plaintiff to class actions with millions of putative class members. These legal proceedings involve various lines of business and a variety of claims (including, but not limited to, common law tort, contract, application of tax laws, antitrust and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel factual allegations and/or unique legal theories. While some matters pending against us specify the damages claimed by the plaintiff or class, many seek an unspecified amount of damages or are at very early stages of the legal process. Even when the amount of damages claimed against us are stated, the claimed amount may be exaggerated and/or unsupported. As a result, some matters have not yet progressed sufficiently through discovery and/or development of important factual information and legal issues to enable us to estimate an amount of loss or a range of possible loss, while other matters have progressed sufficiently such that we are able to estimate an amount of loss or a range of possible loss. We have accrued for certain of our outstanding legal proceedings. An accrual is recorded when it is both (a) probable that a loss has occurred and (b) the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. There may be instances in which an exposure to loss exceeds the accrual. We evaluate, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the accrual that has been previously recorded, or a revision to the disclosed estimated range of possible losses, as applicable. For those disclosed material legal proceedings where a loss is reasonably possible in future periods, whether in excess of a recorded accrual for legal or tax contingencies, or where there is no such accrual, and for which we are able to estimate a range of possible loss, the current estimated range is zero to $240 million in excess of any accruals related to those matters. This range represents management estimate based on currently available information and does not represent our maximum loss exposure; actual results may vary significantly. As such legal proceedings evolve, we may need to increase our range of possible loss or recorded accruals. In addition, it is possible that significantly increased merchant steering or other actions impairing the Card Member experience as a result of an adverse resolution in one or any combination of the disclosed merchant cases could have a material adverse effect on our business. 19 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 9. Derivatives and Hedging Activities We use derivative financial instruments to manage exposures to various market risks. These instruments derive their value from an underlying variable or multiple variables, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and an equity index or price, and are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These instruments enable end users to increase, reduce or alter exposure to various market risks and, for that reason, are an integral component of our market risk management. We do not transact in derivatives for trading purposes. In relation to our credit risk, certain of our bilateral derivative agreements include provisions that allow our counterparties to terminate the agreement in the event of a downgrade of our debt credit rating below investment grade and settle the outstanding net liability position. As of March 31, 2019, these derivatives were not in a material net liability position. Based on our assessment of the credit risk of our derivative counterparties as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, no credit risk adjustment to the derivative portfolio was required. A majority of our derivative assets and liabilities as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 are subject to master netting agreements with our derivative counterparties. We have no derivative amounts subject to enforceable master netting arrangements that are not offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following table summarizes the total fair value, excluding interest accruals, of derivative assets and liabilities as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 : Other Assets Fair Value Other Liabilities Fair Value (Millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Derivatives designated as hedging instruments: Fair value hedges - Interest rate contracts (a) $ 66 $ 34 $ 39 $ 74 Net investment hedges - Foreign exchange contracts 42 222 138 61 Total derivatives designated as hedging instruments 108 256 177 135 Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Foreign exchange contracts, including an embedded derivative 147 258 185 79 Total derivatives, gross 255 514 362 214 Less: Cash collateral netting (b)(c) (46 ) (28 ) (35 ) (78 ) Derivative asset and derivative liability netting (d) (105 ) (90 ) (105 ) (90 ) Total derivatives, net $ 104 $ 396 $ 222 $ 46 (a) For our centrally cleared derivatives, variation margin payments are legally characterized as settlement payments as opposed to collateral. (b) Represents the offsetting of the fair value of bilateral interest rate contracts and certain foreign exchange contracts with the right to cash collateral held from the counterparty or cash collateral posted with the counterparty. (c) We posted $70 million and $84 million as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, as initial margin on our centrally cleared interest rate swaps; such amounts are recorded within Other receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are not netted against the derivative balances. (d) Represents the amount of netting of derivative assets and derivative liabilities executed with the same counterparty under an enforceable master netting arrangement. Fair Value Hedges We are exposed to interest rate risk associated with our fixed-rate long-term debt obligations. At the time of issuance, certain fixed-rate debt obligations are designated in fair value hedging relationships, using interest rate swaps, to economically convert the fixed interest rate to a floating interest rate. We have $22.8 billion and $24.0 billion of fixed-rate debt obligations designated in fair value hedging relationships as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The following table presents the gains and losses recognized in Interest expense associated with the fair value hedges of our fixed-rate long-term debt for the three months ended March 31: Gains (losses) (Millions) 2019 2018 Fixed-rate long-term debt $ (160 ) $ 210 Derivatives designated as hedging instruments 158 (191 ) Total $ (2 ) $ 19 20 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) The carrying values of the hedged liabilities, recorded within Long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, were $22.6 billion and $23.7 billion as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, including offsetting amounts of $81 million and $241 million for the respective periods, related to the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments. We recognized a net increase of $38 million and a net reduction of $14 million in Interest expense on Long-term debt for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, primarily related to the net settlements (interest accruals) on our interest rate derivatives designated as fair value hedges. Net Investment Hedges We had notional amounts of approximately $9.5 billion and $9.6 billion of foreign currency derivatives designated as net investment hedges as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The gain or loss on net investment hedges, net of taxes, recorded in AOCI as part of the cumulative translation adjustment, were losses of $162 million for both the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. Accumulated gains within AOCI of nil and $1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were reclassified into Other expenses upon investment sales or liquidations. Derivatives Not Designated as Hedges The changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are intended to offset the related foreign exchange gains or losses of the underlying foreign currency exposures. The changes in the fair value of the derivatives and the related underlying foreign currency exposures resulted in a net gain of $4 million and a net loss of $21 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, and are recognized in Other expenses. The changes in the fair value of an embedded derivative resulted in losses of nil and $2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and are recognized in Card Member services expense. 21 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 10 .

(d) Presented as a component of Customer deposits on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements We have certain assets that are subject to measurement at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. For these assets, measurement at fair value in periods subsequent to their initial recognition is applicable if they are determined to be impaired or where there are observable price changes for equity investments without readily determinable fair values. During the three months ended March 31, 2019 and the year ended December 31, 2018, we did not have any material assets that were measured at fair value due to impairment. Equity investments that are only adjusted through earnings for observable price changes are not material. 23 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 11. Guarantees The maximum potential undiscounted future payments and related liability resulting from guarantees and indemnifications provided by us in the ordinary course of business were $1 billion and $34 million, respectively, as of March 31, 2019, and $1 billion and $46 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2018, all of which were primarily related to our real estate and business dispositions. To date, we have not experienced any significant losses related to guarantees or indemnifications. Our recognition of these instruments is at fair value. In addition, we establish reserves when a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. 24 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 12. Changes In Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income AOCI is comprised of items that have not been recognized in earnings but may be recognized in earnings in the future when certain events occur. Changes in each component for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows: 2019 (Millions) , net of tax Net Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Debt Securities Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment Gains (Losses) Net Unrealized Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Gains (Losses) Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income Balances as of December 31, 2018 $ (8 ) $ (2,133 ) $ (456 ) $ (2,597 ) Net unrealized gains 17 17 Net translation gains on investments in foreign operations 170 170 Net losses related to hedges of investments in foreign operations (162 ) (162 ) Pension and other postretirement benefits (27 ) (27 ) Net change in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) 17 8 (27 ) (2 ) Balances as of March 31, 2019 $ 9 $ (2,125 ) $ (483 ) $ (2,599 ) 2018 (Millions) , net of tax Net Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Investment Securities Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment Gains (Losses) Net Unrealized Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Gains (Losses) Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income Balances as of December 31, 2017 $ $ (1,961 ) $ (467 ) $ (2,428 ) Net unrealized losses (13 ) (13 ) Net translation gains on investments in foreign operations 192 192 Net losses related to hedges of investments in foreign operations (162 ) (162 ) Pension and other postretirement benefits 28 28 Other (a) 2 2 Net change in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income (11 ) 30 28 47 Balances as of March 31, 2018 $ (11 ) $ (1,931 ) $ (439 ) $ (2,381 ) (a) Represents unrealized gains and losses pertaining to equity securities moved from AOCI to retained earnings as of January 1, 2018, due to the prospective adoption of the financial instruments guidance effective January 1, 2018.

Other Fees and Commissions and Other Expenses The following is a detail of Other fees and commissions for the three months ended March 31: (Millions) 2019 2018 Fees charged to Card Members: Delinquency fees $ 251 $ 242 Foreign currency conversion fee revenue 230 225 Other customer fees: Loyalty coalition-related fees 114 111 Travel commissions and fees 108 99 Service fees and other (a) 100 104 Total Other fees and commissions $ 803 $ 781 (a) Other includes Membership Rewards program fees that are not related to contracts with customers. Revenue expected to be recognized in future periods related to contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less and contracts with variable consideration (e.g. discount revenue) are not required to be disclosed. Non-interest revenue expected to be recognized in future periods through remaining contracts with customers is not material. The following is a detail of Other expenses for the three months ended March 31: (Millions) 2019 2018 Occupancy and equipment $ 508 $ 520 Professional services 494 457 Other (a) 599 457 Total Other expenses $ 1,601 $ 1,434 (a) Other expense primarily includes general operating expenses, a litigation-related charge, communication expenses, Card and merchant-related fraud losses, and unrealized gains on certain equity investments. 26 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 14. Income Taxes The effective tax rate was 20.8 percent and 21.5 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The change in tax rate primarily reflects the resolution of certain prior years tax items in the current period. We are under continuous examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and tax authorities in other countries and states in which we have significant business operations. The tax years under examination and open for examination vary by jurisdiction. In 2018 we settled our US federal income tax audits for tax years 2008-2014, and the statute of limitations for these years remain open through 2019. Tax years from 2015 onwards are open for examination by the IRS. We believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits could decrease within the next 12 months by as much as $113 million, principally as a result of potential resolutions of prior years tax items with various taxing authorities. The prior years tax items include unrecognized tax benefits relating to the deductibility of certain expenses or losses and the attribution of taxable income to a particular jurisdiction or jurisdictions. Of the $113 million of unrecognized tax benefits, approximately $95 million relates to amounts that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate in a future period. 15. Earnings Per Common Share (EPS) The computations of basic and diluted EPS for the three months ended March 31 were as follows: (Millions, except per share amounts) 2019 2018 Numerator: Basic and diluted: Net income $ 1,550 $ 1,634 Preferred dividends (21 ) (21 ) Net income available to common shareholders $ 1,529 $ 1,613 Earnings allocated to participating share awards (a) (11 ) (13 ) Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 1,518 $ 1,600 Denominator: (a) Basic: Weighted-average common stock 841 859 Add: Weighted-average stock options (b) 2 2 Diluted 843 861 Basic EPS $ 1.81 $ 1.86 Diluted EPS $ 1.80 $ 1.86 (a) Our unvested restricted stock awards, which include the right to receive non-forfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents, are considered participating securities. Calculations of EPS under the two-class method exclude from the numerator any dividends paid or owed on participating securities and any undistributed earnings considered to be attributable to participating securities. The related participating securities are similarly excluded from the denominator. (b) The dilutive effect of unexercised stock options excludes from the computation of EPS 0.9 million and 0.6 million of options for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, because inclusion of the options would have been anti-dilutive. 27 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 16. Reportable Operating Segments During 2018, we realigned our reportable operating segments and also made changes to the methodology used to allocate certain corporate overhead costs to the operating segments and our intercompany settlement process. Effective for the first quarter of 2019, we moved intercompany assets and liabilities, previously recorded in the operating segments, to Corporate & Other. For all of the above referenced changes, prior period amounts have been revised to conform to the current period presentation. The following table presents certain selected financial information for our reportable operating segments and Corporate & Other as of or for the three months ended March 31: 2019 (Millions, except where indicated) GCSG GCS GMNS Corporate & Other (a) Consolidated Total non-interest revenues $ 3,741 $ 3,020 $ 1,525 $ 19 $ 8,305 Revenue from contracts with customers (b) 2,578 2,607 1,503 9 6,697 Interest income 2,272 454 9 219 2,954 Interest expense 459 241 (93 ) 288 895 Total revenues net of interest expense 5,554 3,233 1,627 (50 ) 10,364 Net income (loss) $ 821 $ 586 $ 631 $ (488 ) $ 1,550 Total assets (billions) $ 99 $ 54 $ 22 $ 22 $ 197 2018 (Millions, except where indicated) GCSG GCS GMNS Corporate & Other (a) Consolidated Total non-interest revenues $ 3,491 $ 2,838 $ 1,532 $ 16 $ 7,877 Revenue from contracts with customers (b) 2,438 2,454 1,491 4 6,387 Interest income 1,949 377 9 127 2,462 Interest expense 327 171 (59 ) 182 621 Total revenues net of interest expense 5,113 3,044 1,600 (39 ) 9,718 Net income (loss) $ 826 $ 546 $ 516 $ (254 ) $ 1,634 Total assets (billions) $ 91 $ 51 $ 20 $ 18 $ 180 (a) Corporate & Other includes adjustments and eliminations for intersegment activity.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&A) Business Introduction When we use the terms American Express, we, our or us, we mean American Express Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, unless we state or the context implies otherwise. We are a globally integrated payments company that provides our customers with access to products, insights and experiences that enrich lives and build business success. Our principal products and services are charge and credit card products and travel-related services offered to consumers and businesses around the world. Our range of products and services includes: Charge card, credit card and other payment and financing products Merchant acquisition and processing, servicing and settlement, and point-of-sale marketing and information products and services for merchants Network services Other fee services, including fraud prevention services and the design and operation of customer loyalty programs Expense management products and services Travel-related services Our various products and services are sold globally to diverse customer groups, including consumers, large corporations, mid-sized companies and small businesses. These products and services are sold through various channels, including mobile and online applications, direct mail, in-house sales teams, third-party vendors and business partners, and direct response advertising. Business travel-related services are offered through our non-consolidated joint venture, American Express Global Business Travel (the GBT JV). We compete in the global payments industry with charge, credit and debit card networks, issuers and acquirers, paper-based transactions (e.g., cash and checks), bank transfer models (e.g., wire transfers and Automated Clearing House (ACH)), as well as evolving and growing alternative payment and financing providers. As the payments industry continues to evolve, we face increasing competition from non-traditional players that leverage new technologies, business models and customer relationships to create payment or financing solutions. The following types of revenue are generated from our various products and services: Discount revenue, our largest revenue source, primarily represents the amount we earn on transactions occurring at merchants that have entered into a card acceptance agreement with us, or a Global Network Services (GNS) partner or other third-party merchant acquirer, for facilitating transactions between the merchants and Card Members; Interest on loans, principally represents interest income earned on outstanding balances; Net card fees, represent revenue earned from annual card membership fees, which vary based on the type of card and the number of cards for each account; Other fees and commissions, primarily represent Card Member delinquency fees, foreign currency conversion fees charged to Card Members, loyalty coalition-related fees, travel commissions and fees, service fees earned from merchants, and Membership Rewards program fees; and Other revenue, primarily represents revenues arising from contracts with partners of our GNS business (including commissions and signing fees less issuer rate payments), cross-border Card Member spending, ancillary merchant-related fees, insurance premiums earned from Card Members, earnings from equity method investments (including the GBT JV), and prepaid card and Travelers Cheque-related revenue. Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures Certain of the statements in this Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Refer to the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements section. We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). However, certain information included within this Form 10-Q constitutes non-GAAP financial measures. Our calculations of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the calculations of similarly titled measures by other companies. 29 Table of Contents Bank Holding Company American Express is a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve) is our primary federal regulator. As such, we are subject to the Federal Reserve regulations, policies and minimum capital standards. Business Environment Our results for the first quarter reflect a solid start to the year, with broad based billings and revenue growth across our businesses and geographies. We continued to invest in new services and Card Member benefits, new card acquisitions and expanding our merchant network, and we returned a significant amount of capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Earnings per share were down $0.06 relative to the first quarter of 2018, but the current quarter reflected a $0.21 per share impact of a merchant litigation-related charge. Our worldwide billed business increased 4 percent over the prior year and worldwide proprietary billings grew at 7 percent. The US dollar continued to strengthen, relative to the prior year, against the major currencies in which we operate, resulting in a larger negative impact on our billings and revenue growth than in recent quarters. After adjusting for foreign currency exchange (FX) rates, worldwide proprietary billed business increased 9 percent over the prior year, with international proprietary billings continuing double digit growth. 1 GNS billed business declined as we continue to exit the network business in Europe and Australia due to certain regulatory changes; excluding the billings from those geographies, GNS billed business grew 6 percent year-over-year. Revenues net of interest expense increased 7 percent (9 percent on an FX-adjusted basis), driven by a well-balanced mix of growth across Card Member spending, loan volumes and fee income. 1 Card fee revenue reflected an increase in Card Member acquisitions and higher fees on certain of our card products around the world as we continued to add benefits to our product offerings. Card Member loans grew year-over-year, as we continued to expand our lending relationships with existing customers and acquired new Card Members. Provisions for losses increased at a lower rate than in recent quarters due to a smaller reserve build compared to the prior year. The higher reserve build in the first quarter of last year was due to an acceleration in loan growth and the seasoning of our lending book. The increased stability in the lending portfolio in the current year resulted in a lower reserve build compared to Q1 18. We expect provisions for losses to grow at a higher rate than the first quarter over the balance of the year. Spending on customer engagement (the aggregate of rewards, Card Member services, and marketing and business development expenses) increased year-over-year across all categories. Increases in rewards and Card Member services reflected the growth in billings and continued higher levels of investment across many of our premium travel-related benefits. Marketing and business development expense increased due to higher spending on growth initiatives, including Card Member acquisition, continued investments in our cobrand partnerships and higher corporate client incentives. We expect spending on customer engagement to continue to increase, including as a result of our recently announced renewal of our relationships with Delta Air Lines, our largest cobrand partner. We continue to see attractive growth opportunities across our businesses and plan to invest to take advantage of them in order to drive revenue growth over the moderate to long term. While we continue to see some headwinds in the environment, including from regulation in countries around the world and intense competition, we remain focused on delivering differentiated value to our merchants, Card Members and business partners and delivering appropriate returns to our shareholders. See Certain Legislative, Regulatory and Other Developments for information on certain matters that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 1 The foreign currency adjusted information assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into U.S. dollars (i.e., assumes the foreign exchange rates used to determine results for the current period apply to the corresponding prior year period against which such results are being compared). FX-adjusted revenues and expenses constitute non-GAAP measures. We believe the presentation of information on a foreign currency adjusted basis is helpful to investors by making it easier to compare our performance in one period to that of another period without the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. 30 Table of Contents American Express Company Consolidated Results of Operations Refer to the Glossary of Selected Terminology for the definitions of certain key terms and related information appearing within this section. The discussions in both the Consolidated Results of Operations and Business Segment Results provide commentary on the variances for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year, as presented in the accompanying tables. Table 1: Summary of Financial Performance Three Months Ended March 31, Change (Millions, except percentages and per share amounts) 2019 2018 2019 vs. 2018 Total revenues net of interest expense $ 10,364 $ 9,718 $ 646 7 % Provisions for losses 809 775 34 4 Expenses 7,597 6,861 736 11 Pretax income 1,958 2,082 (124 ) (6 ) Income tax provision 408 448 (40 ) (9 ) Net income 1,550 1,634 (84 ) (5 ) Earnings per common share diluted (a) $ 1.80 $ 1.86 $ (0.06 ) (3 )% Return on average equity (b) 31.9 % 15.2 % Effective tax rate 20.8 % 21.5 % (a) Earnings per common share diluted was reduced by the impact of (i) earnings allocated to participating share awards of $11 million and $13 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and (ii) dividends on preferred shares of $21 million for both the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. (b) Return on average equity (ROE) is computed by dividing (i) one-year period net income ($6.8 billion and $3.1 billion for March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively) by (ii) one-year average total shareholders equity ($21.5 billion and $20.5 billion for March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively). Table 2: Total Revenues Net of Interest Expense Summary Three Months Ended March 31, Change (Millions, except percentages) 2019 2018 2019 vs. 2018 Discount revenue $ 6,195 $ 5,889 $ 306 5 % Net card fees 944 830 114 14 Other fees and commissions 803 781 22 3 Other 363 377 (14 ) (4 ) Total non-interest revenues 8,305 7,877 428 5 Total interest income 2,954 2,462 492 20 Total interest expense 895 621 274 44 Net interest income 2,059 1,841 218 12 Total revenues net of interest expense $ 10,364 $ 9,718 $ 646 7 % Total Revenues Net of Interest Expense Discount revenue increased, primarily due to growth in billed business of 4 percent (7 percent on an FX-adjusted basis). 2 U.S. billed business increased 7 percent. Non-U.S. billed business decreased 1 percent, but increased 6 percent on an FX-adjusted basis. 2 See Tables 5 and 6 for more details on billed business performance. The average discount rate of 2.37 percent was unchanged year-over-year. Net card fees increased, primarily driven by growth in the Platinum and Delta portfolios, as well as growth in certain key international countries. Other fees and commissions increased, primarily driven by growth in travel commissions and fees and increases in delinquency fees. Other revenues decreased, primarily driven by lower breakage from prepaid products and a decline in revenues related to transition services agreements. Interest income increased, primarily driven by higher average Card Member loans and modestly higher yields. Interest expense increased, primarily driven by higher interest rates, higher average long-term debt and higher average deposits. 2 Refer to footnote 1 on page 30 for details regarding foreign currency adjusted information . 31 Table of Contents Table 3: Provisions for Losses Summary Three Months Ended March 31, Change (Millions, except percentages) 2019 2018 2019 vs. 2018 Charge card $ 253 $ 242 $ 11 5 % Card Member loans 525 499 26 5 Other 31 34 (3 ) (9 ) Total provisions for losses $ 809 $ 775 $ 34 4 % Provisions for Losses Charge card provision for losses increased, primarily driven by higher net write-offs, which increased in line with growth in receivables due to increased billed business largely in the corporate and small business portfolios. Card Member loans provision for losses increased, driven by loan growth and higher net write-offs, partially offset by a smaller reserve build compared to the prior year, reflecting increased stability in the lending portfolio. The higher reserve build in the first quarter of last year was driven by an acceleration in loan growth and the seasoning of our lending book. Other provision for losses decreased, primarily due to improved credit performance of the commercial financing portfolio. Table 4: Expenses Summary Three Months Ended March 31, Change (Millions, except percentages) 2019 2018 2019 vs. 2018 Marketing and business development $ 1,573 $ 1,345 $ 228 17 % Card Member rewards 2,451 2,347 104 4 Card Member services 550 409 141 34 Total marketing, business development, rewards and Card Member services 4,574 4,101 473 12 Salaries and employee benefits 1,422 1,326 96 7 Other, net 1,601 1,434 167 12 Total expenses $ 7,597 $ 6,861 $ 736 11 % Expenses Marketing and business development expense increased, primarily due to higher spending on growth initiatives, continued investments in partnerships, and increased corporate client incentives driven by higher volumes. Card Member rewards expense increased, primarily driven by increases in Membership Rewards expense of $64 million and cobrand rewards expense of $40 million. The increase in Membership Rewards expense was primarily driven by higher spending volumes, partially offset by a decline in the weighted average cost per point and slower growth in the Membership Rewards ultimate redemption rate (URR). The increase in cobrand rewards expense was primarily driven by higher spending volumes, partially offset by some discrete items in the current year. The Membership Rewards URR for current program participants increased to 96 percent (rounded up) at March 31, 2019 from 95 percent (rounded down) at March 31, 2018. The increase in the URR reflects continued higher engagement in our Membership Rewards program. Card Member services expense increased, primarily driven by higher usage of travel-related benefits. Salaries and employee benefits expense increased, primarily driven by higher payroll and deferred compensation expenses. Other expenses increased, primarily driven by a litigation-related charge, partially offset by the prior-year loss on a transaction involving the operations of our prepaid reloadable and gift card business. 32 Table of Contents Income Taxes The effective tax rate decreased, reflecting the resolution of certain prior years tax items in the current year.

(b) We present a net write-off rate based on principal losses only (i.e., excluding interest and/or fees) to be consistent with industry convention. In addition, as our practice is to include uncollectible interest and/or fees as part of our total provision for losses, a net write-off rate including principal, interest and/or fees is also presented. The net write-off rates and 30+ days past due as a percentage of total for Card Member receivables relate to Global Consumer Services Group (GCSG) and Global Small Business Services (GSBS) Card Member receivables . (c) Global Corporate Payments ( GCP) reflects global, large and middle market corporate accounts. For GCP Card Member receivables, delinquency data is tracked based on days past billing status rather than days past due. A Card Member account is considered 90 days past billing if payment has not been received within 90 days of the Card Member billing statement date. In addition, if we initiate collection procedures on an account prior to the account becoming 90 days past billing, the associated Card Member receivable balance is classified as 90 days past billing. These amounts are shown above as 90+ Days Past Due for presentation purposes. GCP delinquency data for periods other than 90+ days past billing is not available due to system constraints. 35 Table of Contents Table 8: Net Interest Yield on Average Card Member Loans Three Months Ended March 31, (Millions, except percentages and where indicated) 2019 2018 Net interest income $ 2,059 $ 1,841 Exclude: Interest expense not attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio (a) 453 302 Interest income not attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio (b) (335 ) (213 ) Adjusted net interest income (c) $ 2,177 $ 1,930 Average Card Member loans (billions) $ 80.6 $ 72.7 Net interest income divided by average Card Member loans (c) 10.2 % 10.1 % Net interest yield on average Card Member loans (c) 10.9 % 10.8 % (a) Primarily represents interest expense attributable to maintaining our corporate liquidity pool and funding Card Member receivables. (b) Primarily represents interest income attributable to Other loans, interest-bearing deposits and the fixed income investment portfolios. (c) Adjusted net interest income and net interest yield on average Card Member loans are non-GAAP measures. Refer to Glossary of Selected Terminology for the definitions of these terms. We believe adjusted net interest income is useful to investors because it represents the interest expense and interest income attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio and is a component of net interest yield on average Card Member loans, which provides a measure of profitability of our Card Member loan portfolio. Net interest yield on average Card Member loans reflects adjusted net interest income divided by average Card Member loans, computed on an annualized basis. Net interest income divided by average Card Member loans, computed on an annualized basis, a GAAP measure, includes elements of total interest income and total interest expense that are not attributable to the Card Member loan portfolio, and thus is not representative of net interest yield on average Card Member loans. 36 Table of Contents Business Segment Results During 2018, we realigned our reportable operating segments to: GCSG, Global Commercial Services (GCS) and Global Merchant and Network Services (GMNS). Corporate functions and certain other businesses and operations are included in Corporate & Other. We also made changes to the methodology used to allocate certain corporate overhead costs to the operating segments and our intercompany settlement process. Effective for the first quarter of 2019, we moved intercompany assets and liabilities, previously recorded in the operating segments, to Corporate & Other. For all of the above referenced changes, prior period amounts have been revised to conform to the current period presentation.

GCSG also provides services to consumers, including travel-related services and non-card financing products, and manages certain international joint ventures and our partnership agreements in China. Non-interest revenues increased, primarily driven by discount revenue, which increased 6 percent, reflecting an increase in proprietary consumer billed business of 7 percent. U.S. and non-U.S. proprietary consumer billed business increased 7 percent and 8 percent, respectively, both reflecting higher cards-in-force and higher average spend per card. Net card fees increased, primarily driven by growth in the Platinum and Delta portfolios, as well as growth across certain key international countries. Other fees and commissions increased, primarily driven by higher travel commissions, delinquency fees and foreign exchange conversion revenue. Net interest income increased, primarily driven by growth in average Card Member loans and higher yields, partially offset by higher interest expense, primarily driven by higher cost of funds. Provisions for losses increased, driven by loan growth and higher net write-offs, partially offset by a smaller reserve build compared to the prior year, reflecting increased stability in the lending portfolio. The higher reserve build in the first quarter of last year was driven by an acceleration in loan growth and the seasoning of our lending book. 37 Table of Contents Marketing, business development, rewards and Card Member services expenses increased across all expense categories. The increase in marketing and business development expenses was primarily due to higher spending on growth initiatives and higher cobrand partner payments. The increase in Card Member services expense was primarily driven by higher usage of travel-related benefits. The Card Member rewards expense increase was primarily driven by higher proprietary and cobrand spending volumes. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses increased, primarily driven by higher technology and other servicing-related costs, prior-year gains on the re-measurement of certain equity investments and higher payroll costs. The effective tax rate decreased, reflecting the resolution of certain prior years tax items in the current year.

Non-interest revenues increased, primarily driven by higher discount revenue, reflecting growth in billed business from small and medium sized businesses and higher net card fees, primarily due to growth in the U.S. small business Platinum and Gold portfolios. Net interest income increased, primarily driven by an increase in average Card Member loans, partially offset by higher cost of funds. Provisions for losses increased, primarily driven by growth in Card Member loans and higher net write-offs in the small business lending portfolio. Marketing, business development, rewards and Card Member services expenses increased, primarily driven by increases in marketing and business development expenses and Card Member rewards expense, which primarily reflected increased spending on growth initiatives and higher spending volumes, respectively.

GMNS manages our partnership relationships with third-party card issuers, merchant acquirers and a prepaid reloadable and gift card program manager, licensing the American Express brand and extending the reach of the global network. GMNS also manages loyalty coalition businesses in certain countries. Non-interest revenues were flat compared to the prior year, but increased by 3 percent on an FX-adjusted basis. 3 The increase on an FX-adjusted basis was primarily driven by growth in billed business, partially offset by lower breakage on prepaid products. Net interest income increased, reflecting a higher interest expense credit relating to internal transfer pricing, which results in a net benefit for GMNS due to its merchant payables. Marketing, business development, rewards and Card Member services expenses increased primarily driven by payments related to the partnership agreement with our prepaid reloadable and gift card program manager, partially offset by lower levels of spending on growth initiatives. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses decreased, primarily driven by the prior-year loss on a transaction involving the operations of our prepaid reloadable and gift card business. The effective tax rate decreased, reflecting the resolution of certain prior year tax items in the current year, and a discrete tax charge in the prior year. Corporate & Other Corporate functions and certain other businesses are included in Corporate & Other. Corporate & Other net expense was $488 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared to $254 million in the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily driven by a litigation-related charge and increased technology costs. 3 Refer to footnote 1 on page 30 for details regarding foreign currency adjusted information. 43 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Our balance sheet management objectives are to maintain: A solid and flexible equity capital profile; A broad, deep and diverse set of funding sources to finance our assets and meet operating requirements; and Liquidity programs that enable us to continuously meet expected future financing obligations and business requirements for at least a twelve-month period in the event we are unable to continue to raise new funds under our traditional funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions. Capital The following table presents our regulatory risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios and those of our significant bank subsidiary, American Express National Bank (AENB) as of March 31, 2019. Table 15: Regulatory Risk-Based Capital and Leverage Ratios Ratios as of Basel III March 31, Minimum 2019 Risk-Based Capital Common Equity Tier 1 7.0 % American Express Company 10.8 % American Express National Bank 12.1 Tier 1 8.5 American Express Company 11.8 American Express National Bank 12.1 Total 10.5 American Express Company 13.4 American Express National Bank 14.2 Tier 1 Leverage 4.0 American Express Company 10.0 American Express National Bank 9.4 Supplementary Leverage Ratio 3.0 % American Express Company 8.6 American Express National Bank 7.8 % Table 16: Regulatory Risk-Based Capital Components and Risk Weighted Assets American Express Company March 31, ($ in Billions) 2019 Risk-Based Capital Common Equity Tier 1 $ 17.4 Tier 1 Capital 19.0 Tier 2 Capital (a) 2.6 Total Capital 21.6 Risk-Weighted Assets 161.3 Average Total Assets to calculate the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio 189.4 Total Leverage Exposure to calculate supplementary leverage ratio $ 221.4 (a) Tier 2 capital is the sum of the allowance for loan and receivable losses (limited to 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets), minority interest that is not included in Tier 1 capital and $600 million of subordinated notes adjusted for capital held by insurance subsidiaries. We seek to maintain capital levels and ratios in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements and finance such capital in a cost efficient manner; failure to maintain minimum capital levels at American Express or AENB could affect our status as a financial holding company and cause the regulatory agencies with oversight of American Express or AENB to take actions that could limit our business operations. 44 Table of Contents Our primary source of equity capital has been the generation of net income. Capital generated through net income and other sources, such as the exercise of stock options by employees, is used to maintain a strong balance sheet, support asset growth and engage in acquisitions, with excess available for distribution to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We currently expect that the portion of generated capital we allocate to support asset growth will be greater going forward than it has been historically due to projected asset growth. We maintain certain flexibility to shift capital across our businesses as appropriate. For example, we may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements. These infused amounts can affect the capital profile and liquidity levels at the American Express parent company level. The following are definitions for our regulatory risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratio, which are calculated as per standard regulatory guidance: Risk-Weighted Assets Assets are weighted for risk according to a formula used by the Federal Reserve to conform to capital adequacy guidelines. On- and off-balance sheet items are weighted for risk, with off-balance sheet items converted to balance sheet equivalents, using risk conversion factors, before being allocated a risk-adjusted weight. Off-balance sheet exposures comprise a minimal part of the total risk-weighted assets. Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio Calculated as Common Equity Tier 1 capital (CET1), divided by risk-weighted assets. CET1 is the sum of common shareholders equity, adjusted for ineligible goodwill and intangible assets, certain deferred tax assets, as well as certain other comprehensive income items as follows: net unrealized gains/losses on securities and derivatives, foreign currency translation adjustments and net unrealized pension and other postretirement benefit/losses, all net of tax. Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio Calculated as Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 capital is the sum of CET1, our perpetual preferred stock and third-party non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries adjusted for capital held by insurance subsidiaries and deferred tax assets from net operating losses not deducted from CET1. The minimum requirement for the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is 1.5 percent higher than the minimum for the CET1 risk-based capital ratio. We have $1.6 billion of preferred shares outstanding to help address a portion of the Tier 1 capital requirements in excess of common equity requirements. Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio Calculated as the sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 2 capital is the sum of the allowance for loan and receivable losses (limited to 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets), minority interest that is not included in Tier 1 capital and $600 million of subordinated notes, adjusted for capital held by insurance subsidiaries. Tier 1 Leverage Ratio Calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by our average total consolidated assets for the most recent quarter. Supplementary Leverage Ratio Calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by total leverage exposure under Basel III. Total leverage exposure reflects average total consolidated assets with adjustments for Tier 1 capital deductions, average off-balance sheet derivative exposures, average securities purchased under agreements to resell, and average credit equivalents of conditionally and unconditionally cancellable undrawn commitments. In December 2018, federal banking regulators issued a final rule that would provide an optional three-year phase-in period for the day-one adverse regulatory capital effects upon adopting the Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) model pursuant to new accounting guidance for the recognition of credit losses on financial instruments, effective January 1, 2020. The Federal Reserve also released a statement indicating that it plans to maintain the current framework for calculating credit loss allowances on loans in supervisory stress tests through the 2021 stress test cycle. See Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about CECL. Share Repurchases and Dividends We return capital to common shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The share repurchases reduce common shares outstanding and more than offset the issuance of new shares as part of employee compensation plans. During the three months ended March 31, 2019, we returned $1.6 billion to our shareholders in the form of common stock dividends of $0.3 billion and share repurchases of $1.3 billion. We repurchased 12 million common shares at an average price of $104.03 in the first quarter of 2019. These dividend and share repurchase amounts collectively represent approximately 105 percent of total capital generated during the quarter. 45 Table of Contents In addition, during the three months ended March 31, 2019, we paid $21 million in dividends on non-cumulative perpetual preferred shares outstanding. In February 2019, the Federal Reserve changed regulatory requirements, including disclosure requirements, related to supervisory stress testing and company-run stress testing for the 2019 stress test cycle and provided related relief from certain capital planning and regulatory reporting requirements that would otherwise apply in the 2019 stress test cycle. Additionally, we are not required to submit a capital plan to the Federal Reserve in 2019 or participate in the 2019 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR 2019), although we remain subject to the requirement to maintain a capital plan that is approved by our board of directors. In lieu of the quantitative stress test, the Federal Reserve provided us with a formula that defines our maximum payout capacity during the period July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020. Funding Strategy Our principal funding objective is to maintain broad and well-diversified funding sources to allow us to meet our maturing obligations, cost-effectively finance current and future asset growth in our global businesses as well as to maintain a strong liquidity profile. We meet our funding needs through a variety of sources, including direct and third-party distributed deposits and debt instruments, such as senior unsecured debentures, asset securitizations, borrowings through secured borrowing facilities and a long-term committed bank borrowing facility. While we diversify our funding sources by maintaining scale and relevance in unsecured debt, asset securitizations and deposits, we currently expect that the Personal Savings High Yield Savings Account program will become a larger proportion of our funding over time. Summary of Consolidated Debt We had the following consolidated debt and customer deposits outstanding as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018: Table 17: Summary of Consolidated Debt and Customer Deposits (Billions) March 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Short-term borrowings $ 2.0 $ 3.1 Long-term debt 58.4 58.4 Total debt 60.4 61.5 Customer deposits 72.9 70.0 Total debt and customer deposits $ 133.3 $ 131.5 We may redeem from time to time certain debt securities within 31 days prior to the original contractual maturity dates in accordance with the optional redemption provisions of those debt securities. During the three months ended March 31, 2019, we issued (i) $1.5 billion of asset-backed securities from the American Express Credit Account Master Trust (the Lending Trust) consisting of $1.5 billion of three year Class A Certificates at a fixed rate of 2.87 percent, and (ii) $2.0 billion of senior unsecured notes from American Express Company consisting of $1.25 billion of five year notes at a fixed rate of 3.40 percent and $750 million of two year notes at a fixed rate of 3.00 percent. Our funding plan for the full year 2019 includes, among other sources, approximately $6 billion to $12 billion of unsecured term debt issuance and approximately $5 billion to $10 billion of secured term debt issuance. Our funding plans are subject to various risks and uncertainties, such as future business growth, the impact of global economic, political and other events on market capacity, demand for securities offered by us, regulatory changes, ability to securitize and sell receivables, and the performance of receivables previously sold in securitization transactions. Many of these risks and uncertainties are beyond our control. Our equity capital and funding strategies are designed, among other things, to maintain appropriate and stable unsecured debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies: Moody Investor Services (Moody s), Standard & Poor (S&P) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch). Such ratings help support our access to cost-effective unsecured funding as part of our overall funding strategy. Our asset securitization activities are rated separately. 46 Table of Contents Table 18: Unsecured Debt Ratings Credit Agency American Express Entity Short-Term Ratings Long-Term Ratings Outlook Fitch All rated entities F1 A Stable Moody TRS and rated operating subsidiaries (a) Prime-1 A2 Stable Moody's American Express Company Prime-2 A3 Stable S&P TRS (a) N/A A- Stable S&P Other rated operating subsidiaries A-2 A- Stable S&P American Express Company A-2 BBB+ Stable (a) American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. Downgrades in the ratings of our unsecured debt or asset securitization program securities could result in higher funding costs, as well as higher fees related to borrowings under our unused lines of credit. Declines in credit ratings could also reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets. We believe our funding mix, including the proportion of U.S. retail deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to total funding, should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on our funding capacity and costs. Liquidity Management Our liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of on- and off-balance sheet liquidity sources. We seek to maintain liquidity sources in amounts sufficient to meet our expected future financial obligations and business requirements for liquidity for a period of at least twelve months in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions. Our liquidity management strategy includes a number of elements, including, but not limited to: Maintaining diversified funding sources (refer to the Funding Strategy section for more details); Maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and off-balance sheet liquidity sources; Projecting cash inflows and outflows under a variety of economic and market scenarios; Establishing clear objectives for liquidity risk management, including compliance with regulatory requirements; and Incorporating liquidity risk management as appropriate into our capital adequacy framework. The amount and type of liquidity resources we maintain can vary over time, based upon the results of stress scenarios required under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) and other various regulatory liquidity requirements, such as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio, as well as additional stress scenarios required under our liquidity risk policy. The investment income we receive on liquidity resources is less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances. The net interest costs to maintain these resources have been substantial. The level of future net interest costs depends on the amount of liquidity resources we maintain and the difference between our cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields. Securitized Borrowing Capacity As of March 31, 2019, we maintained a committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility, with a maturity date of July 15, 2020, which gives us the right to sell up to $3.0 billion face amount of eligible AAA notes from the American Express Issuance Trust II (the Charge Trust). We also maintained a committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility, with a maturity date of September 15, 2020, which gives us the right to sell up to $2.0 billion face amount of eligible AAA certificates from the Lending Trust. Both facilities are used in the ordinary course of business to fund seasonal working capital needs, as well as to further enhance our contingent funding resources. As of March 31, 2019, no amounts were drawn on either facility. Federal Reserve Discount Window As an insured depository institution, AENB may borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, subject to the amount of qualifying collateral that it may pledge. The Federal Reserve has indicated that both credit and charge card receivables are a form of qualifying collateral for secured borrowings made through the discount window. Whether specific assets will be considered qualifying collateral and the amount that may be borrowed against the collateral, remain at the discretion of the Federal Reserve. We had approximately $72.5 billion as of March 31, 2019 in U.S. credit card loans and charge card receivables that could be sold over time through our securitization trusts or pledged in return for secured borrowings to provide further liquidity, subject in each case to applicable market conditions and eligibility criteria. 47 Table of Contents Committed Bank Credit Facility In addition to the secured borrowing facilities described above, we maintained a committed syndicated bank credit facility as of March 31, 2019 of $3.5 billion, which expires on October 16, 2020. As of March 31, 2019, no amounts were drawn on this facility. Unused Credit Outstanding As of March 31, 2019, we had approximately $308 billion of unused credit outstanding as part of established lending product agreements. Total unused credit does not represent potential future cash requirements, as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn. Our charge card products generally have no pre-set limit, and therefore are not reflected in unused credit available to Card Members. Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the three months ended March 31: Table 19: Cash Flows (Billions) 2019 2018 Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 8.5 $ 2.0 Investing activities (2.7 ) (0.7 ) Financing activities (2.9 ) Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (0.2 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 5.8 $ (1.8 ) Cash Flows from Operating Activities Our cash flows from operating activities primarily include net income adjusted for (i) non-cash items included in net income, such as provisions for losses, depreciation and amortization, deferred taxes and stock-based compensation and (ii) changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities, which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of payments. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities compared to the prior year, was primarily driven by the amount and timing of payments of accounts payable and other liabilities. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Our cash flows from investing activities primarily include changes in Card Member receivables and loans, as well as changes in our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. The increase in net cash used in investing activities was driven by a larger net increase in the investment securities portfolio and growth in Card Member receivables and loans compared to a decline in the prior year. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Our cash flows from financing activities primarily include changes in customer deposits, long-term debt and short-term borrowings, as well as dividend payments and share repurchases. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by a smaller decrease in debt and larger customer deposits, partially offset by a higher level of share repurchases. 48 Table of Contents OTHER MATTERS Certain Legislative, Regulatory and Other Developments We are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world, and the costs of compliance are substantial. In recent years, the financial services industry has been subject to rigorous scrutiny, high regulatory expectations, and a stringent and unpredictable enforcement environment. Governmental authorities have focused, and we believe will continue to focus, considerable attention on reviewing compliance by financial services firms with laws and regulations. Reviews to assess compliance with laws and regulations by governmental authorities, as well as our own internal reviews, have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, changes to our practices, products and procedures, restitution to our customers and increased costs related to regulatory oversight, supervision and examination. We have also been subject to regulatory actions and may continue to be the subject of such actions, including governmental inquiries, investigations, enforcement proceedings and the imposition of fines or civil money penalties, in the event of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with laws or regulations. For example, we have been cooperating with certain governmental authorities that have requested information from, or served subpoenas on, us, seeking information relating to a small, specialized part of our business, known as foreign exchange international payments (FXIP), which offers cross-border payments services primarily to small and middle market business customers in five countries, including the United States. In particular, we received investigative subpoenas from both the civil and criminal divisions of the U.S. Department of Justice as well as inquiries from the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and others. FXIP accounts for less than one half of one percent of our total revenue net of interest expense and is unrelated to our card businesses. Relatedly, we are conducting a review with an outside law firm of FXIP pricing practices. We do not believe this matter will have a material adverse impact on our operations or results. Please see the Supervision and Regulation and Risk Factors sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 (the 2018 Form 10-K) for further information. Payments Regulation Legislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the operation of card networks, including through antitrust actions, legislation and regulations to change certain practices or pricing of card issuers, merchant acquirers and payment networks, and, in some cases, to establish broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes for payment systems. The European Union, Australia and other jurisdictions have focused on interchange fees (that is, the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in payment networks like Visa and Mastercard), as well as the rules, contract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance. Regulation and other governmental actions relating to pricing or practices could affect all networks directly or indirectly, as well as adversely impact consumers and merchants. Among other things, regulation of bankcard fees has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact the discount revenue we earn, including as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees. In some cases, regulations also extend to certain aspects of our business. Broad regulatory oversight over payment systems can also include, in some cases, requirements for international card networks to localize aspects of their operations, such as processing infrastructure and data storage, which could increase our costs and diminish the value of our closed loop. The development and enforcement of payment system regulatory regimes generally continue to grow and may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and maintain and extend our global network. For more information on payments regulation, as well as the potential impacts on our results of operations and business, please see the Supervision and Regulation and Risk Factors sections of the 2018 Form 10-K. 49 Table of Contents Surcharging In various countries, such as certain Member States in the EU and Australia, merchants are permitted by law to surcharge card purchases. In addition, the laws of a number of states in the United States that prohibit surcharging have been challenged in litigation brought by merchant groups and some such laws have been overturned. Surcharging is an adverse customer experience and could have a material adverse effect on us if it becomes widespread, particularly where it only or disproportionately impacts our business. In addition, other steering practices that are permitted by regulation in some countries could also have a material adverse effect on us if they become widespread. For more information on the potential impacts of surcharging and other actions that could impair the Card Member experience, please see the Risk Factors section of the 2018 Form 10-K. Consumer Financial Products Regulation In the United States, our marketing, sale and servicing of consumer financial products and our compliance with certain federal consumer financial laws are supervised and examined by the CFPB, which has broad rulemaking and enforcement authority over providers of credit, savings and payment services and products and authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices. In addition, a number of U.S. states have significant consumer credit protection, disclosure and other laws (in certain cases more stringent than U.S. federal laws). U.S. federal law also regulates abusive debt collection practices, which along with bankruptcy and debtor relief laws, can affect our ability to collect amounts owed to us or subject us to regulatory scrutiny. For more information on consumer financial products regulation, as well as the potential impacts on our results of operations and business, please see the Supervision and Regulation and Risk Factors sections of the 2018 Form 10-K. Antitrust Litigation The U.S. Department of Justice and certain states attorneys general brought an action against us in 2010 alleging that the provisions in our card acceptance agreements with merchants that prohibit merchants from engaging in various actions to discriminate against our card products violate the U.S. antitrust laws. On June 25, 2018, the Supreme Court found in favor of American Express in that case. We continue to vigorously defend similar antitrust claims initiated by merchants. See Note 8 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" for descriptions of the cases. It is possible that actions impairing the Card Member experience, or the resolution of one or any combination of these merchant claims for damages, could have a material adverse effect on our business. For more information on the potential impacts of an adverse decision in the merchant litigations on our business, please see the Risk Factors section of the 2018 Form 10-K. Privacy, Data Protection, Information and Cyber Security Regulatory and legislative activity in the areas of privacy, data protection and information and cyber security continues to increase worldwide. We have established and continue to maintain policies that provide a framework for compliance with applicable laws, meet evolving customer expectations and support and enable business innovation and growth. Global financial institutions like us have experienced a significant increase in information and cyber security risk in recent years and will likely continue to be the target of increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks, including computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, ransomware, social engineering attacks (including phishing, impersonation and identity takeover attempts), hacking, website defacement, denial-of-service attacks and other attacks and similar disruptions from the misconfiguration or unauthorized use of or access to computer systems. For more information on privacy, data protection and information and cyber security regulation and the potential impacts of a major information or cyber security incident on our results of operations and business, please see the Supervision and Regulation and Risk Factors sections of the 2018 Form 10-K. 50 Table of Contents Recently Issued Accounting Standards Refer to the Recently Issued Accounting Standards section of Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Glossary of Selected Terminology Adjusted net interest income A non-GAAP measure that represents net interest income attributable to our Card Member loans (which includes, on a GAAP basis, interest that is deemed uncollectible), excluding the impact of interest expense and interest income not attributable to our Card Member loans. We believe adjusted net interest income is useful to investors because it represents the interest expense and interest income attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio and it is a component of net interest yield on average Card Member loans. Asset securitizations Asset securitization involves the transfer and sale of loans or receivables to a special-purpose entity created for the securitization activity, typically a trust. The trust, in turn, issues securities, commonly referred to as asset-backed securities that are secured by the transferred loans and receivables. The trust uses the proceeds from the sale of such securities to pay the purchase price for the underlying loans or receivables. The loans and receivables of our Lending Trust and Charge Trust (collectively, the Trusts) securitized are reported as assets and the securities issued by the Trusts are reported as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Average discount rate This calculation is generally designed to reflect the average pricing at all merchants accepting American Express cards and represents the percentage of proprietary and GNS billed business retained by us from merchants we acquire, or from merchants acquired by third parties on our behalf, net of amounts retained by such third parties. Billed business Represents transaction volumes (including cash advances) on cards and other payment products issued by American Express (proprietary billed business) and cards issued under network partnership agreements with banks and other institutions, including joint ventures (GNS billed business). In-store spending activity within GNS retail cobrand portfolios, from which we earn no revenue, is not included in billed business. Billed business is reported as in the United States or outside the United States based on the location of the issuer. Capital ratios Represents the minimum standards established by the regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether the regulated entity has sufficient capital to absorb on- and off-balance sheet losses beyond current loss accrual estimates. Refer to the Capital Strategy section under Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity for further related definitions under Basel III. Cards-in-force Represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding by American Express (proprietary cards-in-force) and cards issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements with banks and other institutions, including joint ventures (GNS cards-in-force), except for GNS retail cobrand cards that had no out-of-store spending activity during the prior twelve months. Basic cards-in-force excludes supplemental cards issued on consumer accounts. Card Member The individual holder of an issued American Express-branded charge, credit and certain prepaid cards. Card Member loans Represents the outstanding amount due from Card Members for charges made on their American Express credit cards, as well as any interest charges and card-related fees. Card Member loans also include revolving balances on certain American Express charge card products. Card Member receivables Represents the outstanding amount due from Card Members for charges made on their American Express charge cards, as well as any card-related fees, other than revolving balances on certain American Express charge cards with Pay Over Time features. Such revolving balances are included within Card Member loans. Charge cards Represents cards that generally carry no pre-set spending limits and are primarily designed as a method of payment and not as a means of financing purchases. Charge Card Members generally must pay the full amount billed each month. No finance charges are assessed on charge cards. Each charge card transaction is authorized based on its likely economics reflecting a Card Member most recent credit information and spend patterns. Some charge card accounts have additional Pay Over Time feature(s) that allow revolving of certain charges. Cobrand cards Cards issued under cobrand agreements with selected commercial firms. Pursuant to the cobrand agreements, we make payments to our cobrand partners, which can be significant, based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained. The partner is then liable for providing rewards to the Card Member under the cobrand partner own loyalty program. 51 Table of Contents Credit cards Represents cards that have a range of revolving payment terms, grace periods, and rate and fee structures. Discount revenue Primarily represents revenue earned from fees charged to merchants who have entered into a card acceptance agreement. The discount fee is generally deducted from our payment for Card Member purchases. Interest expense Includes interest incurred primarily to fund Card Member loans and receivables, general corporate purposes and liquidity needs, and is recognized as incurred. Interest expense is divided principally into two categories: (i) deposits, which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions, and (ii) debt, which primarily relates to interest expense on our long-term financing and short-term borrowings, (e.g., commercial paper, federal funds purchased, bank overdrafts and other short-term borrowings), as well as the realized impact of derivatives hedging interest rate risk on our long-term debt. Interest income Includes (i) interest on loans, (ii) interest and dividends on investment securities and (iii) interest income on deposits with banks and other. Interest on loans Assessed using the average daily balance method for Card Member loans. Unless the loan is classified as non-accrual, interest is recognized based upon the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the terms of the applicable account agreement until the outstanding balance is paid or written off. Interest and dividends on investment securities Primarily relates to our performing fixed-income securities. Interest income is recognized as earned using the effective interest method, which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts, fees and other payments, so a constant rate of return is recognized on the outstanding balance of the related investment security throughout its term. Amounts are recognized until securities are in default or when it is likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled. Interest income on deposits with banks and other Recognized as earned, and primarily relates to the placement of cash in excess of near-term funding requirements in interest-bearing time deposits, overnight sweep accounts, and other interest-bearing demand and call accounts. Liquidity Coverage Ratio Represents the minimum standards established by the regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether the regulated entity has sufficient liquidity to meet liquidity needs in periods of financial and economic stress. Merchant acquisition Represents our process of entering into agreements with merchants to accept American Express-branded cards. Net card fees Represents the card membership fees earned during the period. These fees are recognized as revenue over the covered card membership period (typically one year), net of the provision for projected refunds for Card Membership cancellation and deferred acquisition costs. Net interest yield on average Card Member loans A non-GAAP measure that is computed by dividing adjusted net interest income by average Card Member loans, computed on an annualized basis. Reserves and net write-offs related to uncollectible interest are recorded through provisions for losses, and are thus not included in the net interest yield calculation. We believe net interest yield on average Card Member loans is useful to investors because it provides a measure of profitability of our Card Member loan portfolio. Net loss ratio Represents the ratio of GCP charge card write-offs, consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions) and fee components, less recoveries, on Card Member receivables expressed as a percentage of gross amounts billed to corporate Card Members. Net write-off rate principal only Represents the amount of proprietary consumer or small business Card Member loans or receivables written off, consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions), less recoveries, as a percentage of the average loan or receivables balance during the period. Net write-off rate principal, interest and fees Includes, in the calculation of the net write-off rate, amounts for interest and fees in addition to principal for Card Member loans and fees in addition to principal for Card Member receivables. Operating expenses Represents salaries and employee benefits, professional services, occupancy and equipment, and other expenses. Return on average equity Calculated by dividing one-year period net income by one-year average total shareholders equity. 52 Table of Contents
