Recent Developments Capital Management During the third quarter of 2019, we repurchased $7.6 billion of common stock pursuant to the Board of Directors (the Board) 2019 repurchase authorization of approximately $30.9 billion announced on June 27, 2019. For additional information, see Capital Management on page 20 . On July 25, 2019, the Board declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.18 per share, payable on September 27, 2019 to shareholders of record as of September 6, 2019. Additionally, on October 22, 2019, the Board declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.18 per share, payable on December 27, 2019 to shareholders of record as of December 6, 2019. Merchant Services Joint Venture As previously disclosed in the Corporation Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2019, a significant portion of our merchant processing activity is performed by a joint venture, formed in 2009, in which we own a 49 percent ownership interest. The joint venture is accounted for as an equity method investment. On July 29, 2019, we gave notice to the joint venture partner of the termination of the joint venture upon the conclusion of its current term, after which we expect to pursue our own merchant services strategy. In addition, the Corporation and the joint venture partner have an agreement to provide uninterrupted delivery of products and services to the joint venture merchants through at least June 2023. As a result of the above actions, we incurred a non-cash, pretax impairment charge of $2.1 billion included in other general operating expense in the three months ended September 30, 2019. We anticipate accounting for the joint venture as an equity method investment until June 2020. For additional information, see Note 11 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements . U.K. Exit from the EU On October 28, 2019, the EU agreed to extend the deadline for the U.K. withdrawal from the EU to January 31, 2020. The final outcome of negotiations between the U.K. and the EU regarding the terms and conditions of the withdrawal of the U.K. from the EU remains uncertain. We conduct business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa primarily through our subsidiaries in the U.K., Ireland and France. For information on the changes we have implemented to enable us to continue to operate in the region, including establishing a bank and broker-dealer in the EU, see the Corporation Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2019. While we have taken measures to minimize operational disruption and prepare for various potential outcomes of the U.K. withdrawal from the EU, the preparedness of our counterparties and the relevant financial markets infrastructure remain outside our control. The global economic impact of the U.K. withdrawal from the EU remains uncertain and could result in regional and global financial market disruptions. In preparation for the withdrawal, we will continue to assess potential risks, including operational, regulatory and legal risks. LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rates As previously disclosed, to facilitate an orderly transition from Interbank Offered Rates and other benchmark rates to alternative reference rates (ARRs), the Corporation has established an enterprise-wide initiative led by senior management to identify, assess and monitor risks associated with the expected discontinuation or unavailability of benchmarks, including the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR), achieve operational readiness and engage impacted clients in connection with the transition to ARRs. Additionally, the Corporation continues to monitor the development and usage of ARRs, including the Secured Overnight Financing Rate. For more information on the expected replacement of LIBOR and other benchmark rates, see Executive Summary - Recent Developments - LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rates in the MD&A of the Corporation Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30 2019, and Item 1A.

For more information and a corresponding reconciliation to the most closely related financial measures defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 45 . Net income was $5.8 billion and $20.4 billion , or $0.56 and $2.01 per diluted share, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to $7.2 billion and $20.9 billion , or $0.66 and $1.91 per diluted share, for the same periods in 2018 . The decrease in net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 was primarily driven by an increase in noninterest expense as a result of a $2.1 billion pretax impairment charge related to the notice of termination of the merchant services joint venture at the conclusion of its current term. Also contributing to the decrease in net income were higher provision for credit losses and lower noninterest income, partially offset by an increase in net interest income. Total assets increased $71.8 billion from December 31, 2018 to $2.4 trillion primarily driven by higher trading account assets in Global Markets due to increased client balances in Equities and increased levels of inventory in Fixed-Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC) to facilitate expected client demand, higher loans and leases primarily due to continued residential mortgage and commercial loan growth, and increases in federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell driven by short-term reinvestments of excess cash. Total liabilities increased $68.8 billion from December 31, 2018 to $2.2 trillion driven by higher federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase primarily driven by funding needs in the FICC businesses within Global Markets, an increase in long-term debt due to valuation adjustments, higher deposits as a result of continued growth in our Consumer Banking and Global Banking businesses, higher trading account liabilities in FICC to facilitate expected client demand, and an increase in other short-term borrowings as a result of higher Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances. Shareholders equity increased $3.1 billion from December 31, 2018 primarily due to net income, market value increases on debt securities and issuances of preferred stock, partially offset by returns of capital to shareholders through common stock repurchases and common and preferred stock dividends, and the redemption of preferred stock. Net Interest Income Net interest income increased $126 million to $12.2 billion , and $1.1 billion to $36.8 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018. Net interest yield on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis decreased 4 basis points (bps) to 2.41 percent , and increased 2 bps to 2.45 percent for the same periods. The increase in net interest income for both periods was primarily driven by loan and deposit growth, and for the three-month period, partially offset by lower interest rates. The increase in the nine-month period was also due to higher short-end interest rates. Both long- and short-term interest rates have declined during 2019. We expect net interest income for 2019 to grow approximately one percent as compared to 2018. This reflects the expectation for another short-end rate cut in the fourth quarter of 2019, that long-end interest rates remain flat compared to September 30, 2019 and economic conditions remain stable. For more information on net interest yield and the FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 6 , and for more information on interest rate risk management, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 43 . Bank of America 4 Noninterest Income Table 2 Noninterest Income Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Fees and commissions: Card income $ 1,465 $ 1,417 $ 4,286 $ 4,302 Service charges 1,975 1,961 5,717 5,836 Investment and brokerage services 3,494 3,494 10,324 10,616 Investment banking fees 1,533 1,204 4,168 3,979 Total fees and commissions 8,467 8,076 24,495 24,733 Trading account income 1,707 1,717 6,390 6,421 Other income 446 870 1,259 1,531 Total noninterest income $ 10,620 $ 10,663 $ 32,144 $ 32,685 Noninterest income decreased $43 million to $10.6 billion , and decreased $541 million to $32.1 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018. The following highlights the significant changes. Service charges were relatively unchanged for the three-month period and decreased $119 million for the nine-month period primarily driven by lower treasury fees in Global Banking as well as lower fees due to policy changes and lower ATM volume in Consumer Banking. Investment and brokerage services income was unchanged for the three-month period and decreased $292 million for the nine-month period. The decline was primarily due to lower transactional revenue and a decrease in assets under management (AUM) pricing, partially offset by the positive impact of AUM flows. Investment banking fees increased $329 million for the three-month period due to increases in advisory and debt underwriting fees, and increased $189 million for the nine-month period due to increases in advisory and equity underwriting fees, partially offset by decreases in debt underwriting. Other income decreased $424 million and $272 million for the three- and nine-month periods primarily due to an equity investment gain in the prior-year period and lower gains on sales of debt securities. Also, the prior-year nine-month period included a $729 million charge related to the redemption of certain trust preferred securities, partially offset by a $572 million gain from the sale of certain non-core mortgage loans. Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses increased $63 million to $779 million , and $272 million to $2.6 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018. The increases were driven by commercial, primarily as a result of energy reserve releases in the prior-year periods, partially offset by a decrease in consumer, primarily driven by the impact of recoveries recorded in connection with sales of previously charged-off non-core consumer real estate loans. For more information on the provision for credit losses, see Provision for Credit Losses on page 39 . Noninterest Expense Table 3 Noninterest Expense Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Compensation and benefits $ 7,779 $ 7,721 $ 24,000 $ 24,145 Occupancy and equipment 1,663 1,589 4,908 4,787 Information processing and communications 1,163 1,113 3,484 3,399 Product delivery and transaction related 696 687 2,067 2,149 Marketing 440 421 1,410 1,161 Professional fees 386 439 1,155 1,219 Other general operating 3,042 1,044 4,637 3,220 Total noninterest expense $ 15,169 $ 13,014 $ 41,661 $ 40,080 Noninterest expense increased $2.2 billion to $15.2 billion and $1.6 billion to $41.7 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018. The increase in both periods was primarily due to the aforementioned impairment charge of $2.1 billion , increased costs associated with investment in the businesses, including brand-related marketing costs, and higher litigation expense, partially offset by efficiency savings, lower Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) expense and lower amortization of intangibles expense. 5 Bank of America Income Tax Expense Table 4 Income Tax Expense Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Income before income taxes $ 6,859 $ 8,994 $ 24,585 $ 25,886 Income tax expense 1,082 1,827 4,149 5,017 Effective tax rate 15.8 % 20.3 % 16.9 % 19.4 % The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 reflect the impact of our recurring tax preference benefits and discrete tax benefits primarily related to the resolution of various tax matters. The nine-month effective rate also included tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 reflect the impact of our recurring tax preference benefits. The nine-month effective rate also included tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. We expect the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2019 to be approximately 19 percent, absent unusual items. Supplemental Financial Data In this Form 10-Q, we present certain non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items or otherwise include components that differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional useful information to assess our financial condition, results of operations (including period-to-period operating performance) or compliance with prospective regulatory requirements. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same way as non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. We view net interest income and related ratios and analyses on an FTE basis, which when presented on a consolidated basis are non-GAAP financial measures. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 21 percent and a representative state tax rate. Net interest yield, which measures the basis points we earn over the cost of funds, utilizes net interest income (and thus total revenue) on an FTE basis. We believe that presentation of these items on an FTE basis allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practices. We may present certain key performance indicators and ratios excluding certain items (e.g., debit valuation adjustment (DVA) gains (losses)) which result in non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the presentation of measures that exclude these items is useful because such measures provide additional information to assess the underlying operational performance and trends of our businesses and to allow better comparison of period-to-period operating performance. We also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents shareholders equity or common shareholders equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)), net of related deferred tax liabilities ("adjusted" shareholders' equity or common shareholders' equity). These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models use both return on average tangible common shareholders equity and return on average tangible shareholders equity as key measures to support our overall growth goals. These ratios are as follows: Return on average tangible common shareholders equity measures our net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average common shareholders equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders equity divided by total tangible assets. Return on average tangible shareholders' equity measures our net income as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders equity divided by total tangible assets. Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders equity divided by ending common shares outstanding. We believe that the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. Tangible book value per common share provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation to outstanding shares of common stock.

We manage our segments and report their results on an FTE basis. We periodically review capital allocated to our businesses and allocate capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. We utilize a methodology that considers the effect of regulatory capital requirements in addition to internal risk-based capital models. Our internal risk-based capital models use a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment credit, market, interest rate, business and operational risk components. For more information on the nature of these risks, see Managing Risk on page 20 . The capital allocated to the business segments is referred to as allocated capital. Allocated equity in the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting unit. For more information, see Note 8 Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements . For more information on our presentation of financial information on an FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 6 , and for reconciliations to consolidated total revenue, net income and period-end total assets, see Note 18 Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements .

Three-Month Comparison Net income for Global Banking increased $60 million to $2.1 billion primarily driven by higher revenue partially offset by higher provision for credit losses and noninterest expense. Revenue increased $389 million to $5.2 billion driven by higher noninterest income offset in part by a modest decline in net interest income. Net interest income decreased $109 million to $2.6 billion as the impact of deposit and loan growth was more than offset by the allocation of ALM activities and loan spread compression.

For the nine-month period, revenue decreased $85 million as lower ALM results were partly offset by higher leasing-related revenue. Global Transaction Services revenue increased $65 million and $398 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 primarily driven by higher deposit balances and rates. Average loans and leases increased seven percent and six percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 driven by growth in the commercial and industrial portfolio. Average deposits increased seven percent and nine percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 due to growth in domestic and international interest-bearing balances. Global Investment Banking Client teams and product specialists underwrite and distribute debt, equity and loan products, and provide advisory services and tailored risk management solutions. The economics of certain investment banking and underwriting activities are shared primarily between Global Banking and Global Markets under an internal revenue-sharing arrangement.

Global Markets product coverage includes securities and derivative products in both the primary and secondary markets. For more information about Global Markets, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 17 Bank of America Three-Month Comparison Net income for Global Markets decreased $72 million to $847 million . Net DVA losses were $15 million compared to losses of $99 million , and excluding net DVA, net income decreased $136 million to $858 million . These decreases were primarily driven by a decline in revenue and an increase in noninterest expense. Revenue declined $9 million to $3.9 billion as higher sales and trading revenue and investment banking fees were more than offset by a gain on the sale of an equity investment in the prior-year quarter. Sales and trading revenue increased $217 million , and excluding net DVA, increased $133 million primarily driven by an increase in Equities revenue. Noninterest expense increased $46 million to $2.7 billion primarily driven by higher revenue-related expenses and continued investment in technology. Average total assets increased $34.9 billion to $687.4 billion driven by increased levels of inventory in FICC to facilitate expected client demand and higher client balances in Equities. The return on average allocated capital remained unchanged at 10 percent . For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 10 . Nine-Month Comparison Net income for Global Markets decreased $517 million to $2.9 billion . Net DVA losses were $136 million compared to losses of $214 million . Excluding net DVA, net income decreased $577 million to $3.0 billion , primarily driven by a decrease in revenue, partially offset by lower noninterest expense. Revenue declined $746 million to $12.2 billion as sales and trading revenue decreased $677 million , and excluding net DVA, decreased $755 million due to declines in both FICC and Equities revenue. Noninterest expense decreased $174 million to $8.1 billion primarily driven by lower revenue-related expenses. Average total assets increased $9.4 billion to $679.0 billion primarily due to increased levels of inventory in FICC to facilitate expected client demand. Period-end total assets increased $47.1 billion from December 31, 2018 to $689.0 billion due to increased levels of inventory in FICC to facilitate expected client demand and higher client balances in Equities. The return on average allocated capital was 11 percent , down from 13 percent , reflecting lower net income. Sales and Trading Revenue For a description of sales and trading revenue, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . The following table and related discussion present sales and trading revenue, substantially all of which is in Global Markets, with the remainder in Global Banking . In addition, the following table and related discussion present sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information on net DVA, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 6 . Sales and Trading Revenue (1, 2, 3) Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Sales and trading revenue (2) Fixed-income, currencies and commodities $ 2,056 $ 1,989 $ 6,433 $ 6,754 Equities 1,148 998 3,473 3,829 Total sales and trading revenue $ 3,204 $ 2,987 $ 9,906 $ 10,583 Sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA (4) Fixed-income, currencies and commodities $ 2,074 $ 2,069 $ 6,560 $ 6,941 Equities 1,145 1,017 3,482 3,856 Total sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA $ 3,219 $ 3,086 $ 10,042 $ 10,797 (1) For more information on sales and trading revenue, see Note 3 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . (2) Includes FTE adjustments of $52 million and $132 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to $54 million and $200 million for the same periods in 2018 . (3) Includes Global Banking sales and trading revenue of $147 million and $390 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to $51 million and $297 million for the same periods in 2018 . (4) FICC and Equities sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, is a non-GAAP financial measure. FICC net DVA losses were $18 million and $127 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to losses of $80 million and $187 million for the same periods in 2018 . Equities net DVA gains were $3 million and losses of $9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to losses of $19 million and $27 million for the same periods in 2018 . The following explanations for period-over-period changes in sales and trading, FICC and Equities revenue exclude net DVA, but would be the same if net DVA was included. Three-Month Comparison FICC revenue increased $5 million primarily driven by an improvement in mortgage and municipal products, largely offset by weaker trading performance in foreign exchange and credit products. Equities revenue increased $128 million driven by growth in client financing activities. Nine-Month Comparison FICC revenue decreased $381 million due to a generally weaker trading environment. Equities revenue decreased $374 million driven by under performance in derivatives compared to a strong prior-year period which benefited from higher client activity and elevated market volatility.

Average allocated assets were $536.8 billion and $540.9 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to $516.3 billion and $516.8 billion for the same periods in 2018, and period-end allocated assets were $546.5 billion and $540.8 billion at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . n/m = not meaningful All Other consists of ALM activities, equity investments, non-core mortgage loans and servicing activities, liquidating businesses and certain expenses not otherwise allocated to a business segment. ALM activities encompass certain residential mortgages, debt securities, and interest rate and foreign currency risk management activities. Substantially all of the results of ALM activities are allocated to our business segments . Equity investments include our merchant services joint venture, as well as a portfolio of equity, real estate and other alternative investments . For information on our merchant services joint venture, see Note 11 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements . For additional information about All Other, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Residential mortgage loans that are held for ALM purposes, including interest rate or liquidity risk management, are classified as core and are presented on the balance sheet of All Other . During the nine months ended September 30, 2019 , residential mortgage loans held for ALM activities decreased $2.4 billion to $22.5 billion primarily as a result of payoffs and paydowns. Non-core residential mortgage and home equity loans, which are principally runoff portfolios, are also held in All Other . During the nine months ended September 30, 2019 , total non-core loans decreased $6.5 billion to $17.0 billion due primarily to sales, payoffs and paydowns as well as Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan conveyances, offset by repurchases. For more information on the composition of the core and non-core portfolios, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 26 . Three-Month Comparison The net loss for All Other was $1.6 billion compared to net income of $32 million for the prior-year period. The current-year period included a $2.1 billion pretax impairment charge related to the notice of termination of the merchant services joint venture at the conclusion of its current term. Revenue decreased $669 million due to lower net interest income and an increase in the loss in noninterest income. Net interest income decreased $116 million driven by lower loan balances due to non-core consumer real estate loan sales and portfolio run-off. The loss in noninterest income increased $553 million driven by the results of certain ALM and other treasury activities, an increase in the reserve for payment protection insurance and lower gains on sales of debt securities. The benefit in the provision for credit losses increased $200 million to $295 million primarily due to recoveries from sales of previously charged-off non-core consumer real estate loans. Noninterest expense increased $2.0 billion to $2.5 billion due to the $2.1 billion impairment charge and higher legacy mortgage-related litigation expense. The income tax benefit was $1.3 billion compared to an income tax benefit of $488 million in the same period in 2018. The increase in the tax benefit was primarily related to the tax impact of the impairment charge and discrete tax benefits from the resolution of various tax matters. Both periods included income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking. Nine-Month Comparison The net loss for All Other increased $1.3 billion to a loss of $1.6 billion due to the same factor as described in the three-month discussion. Revenue decreased $844 million due to the same factors as described in the three-month discussion. The benefit in the provision for credit losses increased $238 million to $590 million primarily driven by the same factor as described in the three-month discussion. Noninterest expense increased $1.9 billion to $3.4 billion due to the same factors as described in the three-month discussion. The income tax benefit was $3.1 billion compared to a benefit of $1.9 billion in the same period in 2018 driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion. Both periods included income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking . 19 Bank of America Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have contractual obligations to make future payments on debt and lease agreements. Additionally, in the normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements whereby we commit to future purchases of products or services from unaffiliated parties. For more information on obligations and commitments, see Note 11 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein, as well as Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K , and Note 11 Long-term Debt and Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Representations and Warranties Obligations For information on representations and warranties obligations in connection with the sale of mortgage loans, see Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . For more information related to the sensitivity of the assumptions used to estimate our reserve for representations and warranties, see Complex Accounting Estimates Representations and Warranties Liability in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Managing Risk Risk is inherent in all our business activities. The seven key types of risk faced by the Corporation are strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational. Sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver for our shareholders. If not managed well, risks can result in financial loss, regulatory sanctions and penalties, and damage to our reputation, each of which may adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategies. The Corporation takes a comprehensive approach to risk management with a defined Risk Framework and an articulated Risk Appetite Statement which are approved annually by the Enterprise Risk Committee and the Board. Our Risk Framework is the foundation for consistent and effective management of risks facing the Corporation. The Risk Framework sets forth clear roles, responsibilities and accountability for the management of risk and provides a blueprint for how the Board, through delegation of authority to committees and executive officers, establishes risk appetite and associated limits for our activities. Our Risk Appetite Statement is intended to ensure that the Corporation maintains an acceptable risk profile by providing a common framework and a comparable set of measures for senior management and the Board to clearly indicate the level of risk the Corporation is willing to accept. Risk appetite is set at least annually and is aligned with the Corporation strategic, capital and financial operating plans. Our line of business strategies and risk appetite are also similarly aligned. For more information on our Risk Framework, our risk management activities and the key types of risk faced by the Corporation, see the Managing Risk through Reputational Risk sections in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Capital Management The Corporation manages its capital position so that its capital is more than adequate to support its business activities and aligns with risk, risk appetite and strategic planning. For more information on capital management, including related regulatory requirements, see Capital Management in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . CCAR and Capital Planning The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) requires BHCs to submit a capital plan and requests for capital actions on an annual basis, consistent with the rules governing the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) capital plan. On June 27, 2019, following the Federal Reserve non-objection to our 2019 CCAR capital plan, the Board authorized the repurchase of approximately $30.9 billion in common stock from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020, which includes approximately $900 million to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans during the same period. During the third quarter of 2019, we repurchased $7.6 billion of common stock pursuant to the Board's 2019 repurchase authorization. Our stock repurchases are subject to various factors, including the Corporation capital position, liquidity, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock trading price and general market conditions, and may be suspended at any time. The repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including repurchase plans that satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). As a well-capitalized BHC, we may notify the Federal Reserve of our intention to make additional capital distributions not to exceed 0.25 percent of Tier 1 capital, and which were not contemplated in our capital plan, subject to the Federal Reserve non-objection. Regulatory Capital As a financial services holding company, we are subject to regulatory capital rules, including Basel 3, issued by U.S. banking regulators. The Corporation's depository institution subsidiaries are also subject to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. The Corporation and its primary affiliated banking entity, BANA, are Advanced approaches institutions under Basel 3 and are required to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and risk-weighted assets under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is used to assess capital adequacy including under the PCA framework. As of September 30, 2019 , the Common equity tier 1 (CET1) and Tier 1 capital ratios for the Corporation were lower under the Standardized approach whereas the Advanced approaches yielded a lower Total capital ratio. Minimum Capital Requirements Minimum capital requirements and related buffers were fully phased in as of January 1, 2019. In order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments, the Corporation must meet risk-based capital ratio requirements that include a capital conservation buffer greater than 2.5 percent, plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer and a global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge. The buffers and surcharge must be comprised solely of CET1 capital. The Corporation is also required to maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Our insured depository institution subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be considered well capitalized under the PCA framework. Bank of America 20 Capital Composition and Ratios Table 8 presents Bank of America Corporation capital ratios and related information in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced approaches as measured at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . As of the periods presented herein, the Corporation met the definition of well capitalized under current regulatory requirements. Table 8 Bank of America Corporation Regulatory Capital under Basel 3 Standardized Approach Advanced Approaches Regulatory Minimum (1) (Dollars in millions, except as noted) September 30, 2019 Risk-based capital metrics: Common equity tier 1 capital $ 169,203 $ 169,203 Tier 1 capital 192,029 192,029 Total capital (2) 225,430 217,247 Risk-weighted assets (in billions) 1,484 1,440 Common equity tier 1 capital ratio 11.4 % 11.7 % 9.5 % Tier 1 capital ratio 12.9 13.3 11.0 Total capital ratio 15.2 15.1 13.0 Leverage-based metrics: Adjusted quarterly average assets (in billions) (3) $ 2,336 $ 2,336 Tier 1 leverage ratio 8.2 % 8.2 % 4.0 SLR leverage exposure (in billions) $ 2,898 SLR 6.6 % 5.0 December 31, 2018 Risk-based capital metrics: Common equity tier 1 capital $ 167,272 $ 167,272 Tier 1 capital 189,038 189,038 Total capital (2) 221,304 212,878 Risk-weighted assets (in billions) 1,437 1,409 Common equity tier 1 capital ratio 11.6 % 11.9 % 8.25 % Tier 1 capital ratio 13.2 13.4 9.75 Total capital ratio 15.4 15.1 11.75 Leverage-based metrics: Adjusted quarterly average assets (in billions) (3) $ 2,258 $ 2,258 Tier 1 leverage ratio 8.4 % 8.4 % 4.0 SLR leverage exposure (in billions) $ 2,791 SLR 6.8 % 5.0 (1) The capital conservation buffer and G-SIB surcharge were both 2.5 percent at September 30, 2019 and 1.875 percent at December 31, 2018 . The countercyclical capital buffer for both periods was zero . The SLR minimum includes a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent. (2) Total capital under the Advanced approaches differs from the Standardized approach due to differences in the amount permitted in Tier 2 capital related to the qualifying allowance for credit losses. (3) Reflects total average assets adjusted for certain Tier 1 capital deductions. CET1 capital was $169.2 billion at September 30, 2019 , an increase of $1.9 billion from December 31, 2018 , driven by earnings and net unrealized gains on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities included in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI), partially offset by common stock repurchases and dividends. During the nine months ended September 30, 2019 , Total capital under the Advanced approaches increased $4.4 billion primarily driven by the same factors as CET1 capital and a net increase in preferred stock. Risk-weighted assets under the Standardized approach, which yielded the lower CET1 capital ratio at September 30, 2019 , increased $ 46.6 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to $1,484 billion primarily due to increased client activity in Global Markets and Global Banking and an increase in other assets.

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity Requirements Effective January 1, 2019, the Corporation is subject to the Federal Reserve final rule requiring G-SIBs to maintain minimum levels of total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) and long-term debt. TLAC consists of the Corporation Tier 1 capital and eligible long-term debt issued directly by the Corporation. Eligible long-term debt for TLAC ratios is comprised of unsecured debt that has a remaining maturity of at least one year and satisfies additional requirements as prescribed in the TLAC final rule. As with the risk-based capital ratios and SLR, the Corporation is required to maintain TLAC ratios in excess of minimum requirements plus applicable buffers in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Table 12 presents the Corporation's TLAC and long-term debt ratios and related information as of September 30, 2019 . Bank of America 22 Table 12 Bank of America Corporation Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity and Long-Term Debt TLAC Regulatory Minimum (1) Long-term Debt Regulatory Minimum (2) (Dollars in millions) September 30, 2019 Total eligible balance $ 368,490 $ 168,864 Percentage of risk-weighted assets (3) 24.8 % 22.0 % 11.4 % 8.5 % Percentage of SLR leverage exposure 12.7 9.5 5.8 4.5 (1) The TLAC risk-weighted assets regulatory minimum consists of 18.0 percent plus a TLAC risk-weighted assets buffer comprised of 2.5 percent plus the method 1 G-SIB surcharge of 1.5 percent. The countercyclical buffer is zero for this period. The TLAC SLR leverage exposure regulatory minimum consists of 7.5 percent plus a 2.0 percent TLAC leverage buffer. The TLAC risk-weighted assets and leverage buffers must be comprised solely of CET1 capital and Tier 1 capital, respectively. (2) The long-term debt risk-weighted assets regulatory minimum is comprised of 6.0 percent plus an additional 2.5 percent requirement based on the Corporation method 2 G-SIB surcharge. (3) The approach that yields the higher risk-weighted assets is used to calculate TLAC and long-term debt ratios, which was the Standardized approach as of September 30, 2019 . Regulatory Developments The following supplements the disclosure in Capital Management Regulatory Developments in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the Corporation Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2019. Broker-dealer Regulatory Capital and Securities Regulation The Corporation principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are BofA Securities, Inc. (BofAS), Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp (MLPCC) and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (MLPF&S). As previously disclosed in the Corporation Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2019, BofAS was formed as a result of the reorganization of MLPF&S which was completed in May 2019. The Corporation's principal European broker-dealer subsidiaries are Merrill Lynch International (MLI) and BofA Securities Europe SA (BofASE). The U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the net capital requirements of Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act. BofAS computes its minimum capital requirements as an alternative net capital broker-dealer under Rule 15c3-1, and MLPCC and MLPF&S compute their minimum capital requirements in accordance with the alternative standard under Rule 15c3-1. BofAS and MLPCC are also registered as futures commission merchants and are subject to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Regulation 1.17. BofAS provides institutional services and is required to maintain tentative net capital in excess of $1.0 billion and net capital in excess of the greater of $500 million or a certain percentage of its reserve requirement. BofAS is also required to hold a certain percentage of its risk-based margin in order to meet its CFTC minimum net capital requirement. At September 30, 2019 , BofAS had tentative net capital of $13.3 billion. BofAS also had regulatory net capital of $11.1 billion which exceeded the minimum requirement of $2.3 billion by $8.8 billion. MLPCC is a fully-guaranteed subsidiary of BofAS and provides clearing and settlement services. At September 30, 2019 , MLPCC regulatory net capital of $4.8 billion exceeded the minimum requirement of $1.2 billion by $3.7 billion. MLPF&S provides retail services. At September 30, 2019 , MLPF&S' regulatory net capital was $3.3 billion which exceeded the minimum requirement of $104 million by $3.2 billion Our European broker-dealers are regulated by non-U.S. regulators. MLI, a U.K. investment firm, is regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority, and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. At September 30, 2019 , MLI capital resources were $35.0 billion, which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $14.8 billion by $20.2 billion. BofASE, a French investment firm, is regulated by the Autorit de Contr le Prudentiel et de R solution and the Autorit des March Financiers, and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. At September 30, 2019 , BofASE's capital resources were $5.0 billion which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $1.3 billion by $3.7 billion. Liquidity Risk Funding and Liquidity Risk Management Our primary liquidity risk management objective is to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral needs while continuing to support our businesses and customers under a range of economic conditions. To achieve that objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk under expected and stressed conditions, maintain liquidity and access to diverse funding sources, including our stable deposit base, and seek to align liquidity-related incentives and risks. We define liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we can use to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations as those obligations arise. We manage our liquidity position through line of business and ALM activities, as well as through our legal entity funding strategy, on both a forward and current (including intraday) basis under both expected and stressed conditions. We believe that a centralized approach to funding and liquidity management enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding sources, minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events. For more information regarding global funding and liquidity risk management, as well as our liquidity sources, liquidity arrangements, contingency planning and credit ratings discussed below, see Liquidity Risk in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . NB Holdings Corporation We have intercompany arrangements with certain key subsidiaries under which we transferred certain assets of Bank of America Corporation, as the parent company, which is a separate and distinct legal entity from our banking and nonbank subsidiaries, and agreed to transfer certain additional parent company assets not needed to satisfy anticipated near-term expenditures, to NB Holdings Corporation, a wholly-owned holding company subsidiary (NB Holdings). The parent company is expected to continue to have access to the same flow of dividends, interest and other amounts of cash necessary to service its debt, pay dividends and perform other obligations as it would have had if it had not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets. These arrangements support our preferred single point of entry resolution strategy, under which only the parent company would be resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Global Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets Table 13 presents average Global Liquidity Sources (GLS) for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . 23 Bank of America Table 13 Average Global Liquidity Sources Three Months Ended (Dollars in billions) September 30 2019 December 31 2018 Parent company and NB Holdings $ 65 $ 76 Bank subsidiaries 426 420 Other regulated entities 61 48 Total Average Global Liquidity Sources $ 552 $ 544 We maintain liquidity available to the Corporation, including the parent company and selected subsidiaries, in the form of cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Typically, parent company and NB Holdings liquidity is in the form of cash deposited with BANA. Our bank subsidiaries liquidity is primarily driven by deposit and lending activity, as well as securities valuation and net debt activity. Liquidity at bank subsidiaries excludes the cash deposited by the parent company and NB Holdings. Our bank subsidiaries can also generate incremental liquidity by pledging a range of unencumbered loans and securities to certain FHLBs and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against this pool of specifically-identified eligible assets was $356 billion and $344 billion at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . We have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against these assets, including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loans and securities collateral. Eligibility is defined in guidelines from the FHLBs and the Federal Reserve and is subject to change at their discretion. Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries can generally be used only to fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries, and transfers to the parent company or nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to prior regulatory approval. Liquidity held in other regulated entities, comprised primarily of broker-dealer subsidiaries, is primarily available to meet the obligations of that entity and transfers to the parent company or to any other subsidiary may be subject to prior regulatory approval due to regulatory restrictions and minimum requirements. Our other regulated entities also hold unencumbered investment-grade securities and equities that we believe could be used to generate additional liquidity. Table 14 presents the composition of average GLS for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . Table 14 Average Global Liquidity Sources Composition Three Months Ended (Dollars in billions) September 30 2019 December 31 2018 Cash on deposit $ 103 $ 113 U.S. Treasury securities 81 81 U.S. agency securities and mortgage-backed securities 353 340 Non-U.S. government securities 15 10 Total Average Global Liquidity Sources $ 552 $ 544 Our GLS are substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the final U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) rules. However, HQLA for purposes of calculating LCR is not reported at market value, but at a lower value that incorporates regulatory deductions and the exclusion of excess liquidity held at certain subsidiaries. The LCR is calculated as the amount of a financial institution unencumbered HQLA relative to the estimated net cash outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period of significant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. Our average consolidated HQLA, on a net basis, was $454 billion and $446 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . For the same periods, the average consolidated LCR was 116 percent and 118 percent . Our LCR will fluctuate due to normal business flows from customer activity. Liquidity Stress Analysis We utilize liquidity stress analysis to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our subsidiaries to meet contractual and contingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios. For more information on our liquidity stress analysis, see Liquidity Risk Liquidity Stress Analysis in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Diversified Funding Sources We fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits, and secured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally coordinated funding approach diversified across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups. We fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposits, which were $1.39 trillion and $1.38 trillion at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . Our trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded on a secured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements, and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions. Long-term Debt During the nine months ended September 30, 2019 , we issued $45.2 billion of long-term debt consisting of $24.3 billion for Bank of America Corporation, substantially all of which was TLAC eligible, $10.9 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $10.0 billion of other debt. Substantially all of the long-term, TLAC-eligible senior notes issued by Bank of America Corporation since late 2016 are callable, at our option, at least one year before each stated maturity date. The call features give us the flexibility to retire long-term notes before their final year outstanding, when they are no longer eligible to count toward TLAC requirements, and replace them with new TLAC-eligible debt, should we choose to do so. During the nine months ended September 30, 2019 , we had total long-term debt maturities and redemptions in the aggregate of $42.8 billion consisting of $16.6 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $19.8 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $6.4 billion of other debt. Table 15 presents the carrying value of aggregate annual contractual maturities of long-term debt at September 30, 2019 .

(2) Represents the total long-term debt included in the liabilities of consolidated variable interest entities (VIEs) on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Table 16 presents our long-term debt by major currency at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . Table 16 Long-term Debt by Major Currency (Dollars in millions) September 30 2019 December 31 2018 U.S. dollar $ 193,583 $ 180,724 Euro 32,866 34,328 British pound 5,345 5,450 Japanese yen 4,325 3,038 Canadian dollar 3,805 2,936 Australian dollar 1,878 1,722 Other 1,603 1,194 Total long-term debt $ 243,405 $ 229,392 Total long-term debt increased $14.0 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 primarily due to debt issuances and valuation adjustments, partially offset by maturities and redemptions. We may, from time to time, purchase outstanding debt instruments in various transactions, depending on market conditions, liquidity and other factors. Our other regulated entities may also make markets in our debt instruments to provide liquidity for investors. For more information on long-term debt funding, see Note 11 Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . We use derivative transactions to manage the duration, interest rate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering the characteristics of the assets they are funding. For more information on our ALM activities, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 43 . We may issue unsecured debt in the form of structured notes for client purposes, certain of which qualify as TLAC-eligible debt. During the nine months ended September 30, 2019 , we issued $7.4 billion of structured notes, which are debt obligations that pay investors returns linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these liabilities with derivatives and/ or investments in the underlying instruments, so that from a funding perspective, the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We could be required to settle certain structured note obligations for cash or other securities prior to maturity under certain circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning purposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date. Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price. Credit Ratings Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating agencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other securities, including asset securitizations. Table 17 presents the Corporation current long-term/short-term senior debt ratings and outlooks expressed by the rating agencies. The ratings from Moody Investors Service and Fitch Ratings for the Corporation and its subsidiaries have not changed from those disclosed in the Corporation's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2019 . The ratings from Standard & Poor Global Ratings (S&P) for the Corporation and its subsidiaries did not change from those disclosed in the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The long-term and short-term debt ratings of BofAS and BofASE, which were initially rated by S&P and Fitch during the first quarter of 2019 , also remained unchanged for the third quarter of 2019 . For more information on additional collateral and termination payments that could be required in connection with certain over-the-counter derivative contracts and other trading agreements as a result of a credit rating downgrade, see Note 3 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein and Item 1A.

For information on the new accounting standard on credit losses that is effective on January 1, 2020 and the potential impact on our allowance for credit losses, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Credit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower credit cycle. Statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio management including underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting credit limits, and establishing operating processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns. Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources such as credit bureaus and/or internal historical experience and are a component of our consumer credit risk management process. These models are used in part to assist in making both new and ongoing credit decisions, as well as portfolio management strategies, including authorizations and line management, collection practices and strategies, and determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allocated capital for credit risk. Consumer Credit Portfolio Improvement in home prices continued during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 resulting in improved credit quality compared to the same period in 2018 . Additionally, lower credit losses in the consumer real estate portfolio due primarily to non-core loan sales were partially offset by seasoning in the U.S. credit card portfolio compared to the same period in 2018 . Improved credit quality and continued loan balance runoff primarily in the non-core consumer real estate portfolio, partially offset by seasoning within the U.S. credit card portfolio, drove a $226 million decrease in the consumer allowance for loan and lease losses during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to $4.6 billion . For additional information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 39 .

We categorize consumer real estate loans as core and non-core based on loan and customer characteristics such as origination date, product type, loan-to-value (LTV), Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score and delinquency status consistent with our current consumer and mortgage servicing strategy. Generally, loans that were originated after January 1, 2010, qualified under government-sponsored enterprise underwriting guidelines, or otherwise met our underwriting guidelines in place in 2015 are characterized as core loans. All other loans are generally characterized as non-core loans and represent runoff portfolios. Core loans as reported in Table 20 include loans held in the Consumer Banking and GWIM segments, as well as loans held for ALM activities in All Other . As shown in Table 20 , outstanding core consumer real estate loans increased $18.6 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 driven by an increase of $22.5 billion in residential mortgage, partially offset by a $3.9 billion decrease in home equity. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, we sold $2.3 billion and $4.2 billion of consumer real estate loans, primarily non-core. 27 Bank of America Table 20 Consumer Real Estate Portfolio (1) Outstandings Nonperforming Net Charge-offs September 30 2019 December 31 2018 September 30 2019 December 31 2018 Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Core portfolio Residential mortgage $ 216,223 $ 193,695 $ 930 $ 1,010 $ (6 ) $ $ (2 ) $ 13 Home equity 36,116 40,010 380 955 8 15 39 52 Total core portfolio 252,339 233,705 1,310 1,965 2 15 37 65 Non-core portfolio Residential mortgage 11,249 14,862 621 883 (32 ) 12 (49 ) Home equity 5,458 8,276 205 938 (210 ) (35 ) (385 ) (39 ) Total non-core portfolio 16,707 23,138 826 1,821 (242 ) (23 ) (434 ) (39 ) Consumer real estate portfolio Residential mortgage 227,472 208,557 1,551 1,893 (38 ) 12 (51 ) 13 Home equity 41,574 48,286 585 1,893 (202 ) (20 ) (346 ) 13 Total consumer real estate portfolio $ 269,046 $ 256,843 $ 2,136 $ 3,786 $ (240 ) $ (8 ) $ (397 ) $ 26 Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Provision for Loan and Lease Losses September 30 2019 December 31 2018 Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 2019 2018 2019 2018 Core portfolio Residential mortgage $ 219 $ 214 $ (4 ) $ (2 ) $ 3 $ 7 Home equity 135 228 (19 ) (27 ) (52 ) (51 ) Total core portfolio 354 442 (23 ) (29 ) (49 ) (44 ) Non-core portfolio Residential mortgage 122 208 (39 ) 22 (91 ) (103 ) Home equity 115 278 (250 ) (112 ) (481 ) (221 ) Total non-core portfolio 237 486 (289 ) (90 ) (572 ) (324 ) Consumer real estate portfolio Residential mortgage 341 422 (43 ) 20 (88 ) (96 ) Home equity 250 506 (269 ) (139 ) (533 ) (272 ) Total consumer real estate portfolio $ 591 $ 928 $ (312 ) $ (119 ) $ (621 ) $ (368 ) (1) Outstandings and nonperforming loans exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. Consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option include residential mortgage loans of $275 million and $336 million and home equity loans of $365 million and $346 million at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . For additional information, see Note 16 Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements . We believe that the presentation of information adjusted to exclude the impact of the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option is more representative of the ongoing operations and credit quality of the business. As a result, in the following tables and discussions of the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios, we exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option and provide information that excludes the impact of the fully-insured loan portfolio in certain credit quality statistics. Residential Mortgage The residential mortgage portfolio made up the largest percentage of our consumer loan portfolio at 50 percent of consumer loans and leases at September 30, 2019 . Approximately 49 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio was in Consumer Banking and 36 percent was in GWIM. The remaining portion was in All Other and was comprised of originated loans, purchased loans used in our overall ALM activities, delinquent FHA loans repurchased pursuant to our servicing agreements with the Government National Mortgage Association as well as loans repurchased related to our representations and warranties. Outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio increased $18.9 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 as retention of new originations was partially offset by loan sales of $2.3 billion and runoff. At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , the residential mortgage portfolio included $18.7 billion and $20.1 billion of outstanding fully-insured loans, of which $11.7 billion and $14.0 billion had FHA insurance with the remainder protected by long-term standby agreements. Table 21 presents certain residential mortgage key credit statistics on both a reported basis and excluding the fully-insured loan portfolio. The following discussion presents the residential mortgage portfolio excluding the fully-insured loan portfolio. Bank of America 28 Table 21 Residential Mortgage Key Credit Statistics Reported Basis (1) Excluding Fully-insured Loans (1) (Dollars in millions) September 30 2019 December 31 2018 September 30 2019 December 31 2018 Outstandings $ 227,472 $ 208,557 $ 208,781 $ 188,427 Accruing past due 30 days or more 2,989 3,945 1,070 1,155 Accruing past due 90 days or more 1,203 1,884 Nonperforming loans 1,551 1,893 1,551 1,893 Percent of portfolio Refreshed LTV greater than 90 but less than or equal to 100 2 % 2 % 2 % 2 % Refreshed LTV greater than 100 1 1 1 1 Refreshed FICO below 620 3 4 2 2 2006 and 2007 vintages (2) 4 6 4 6 (1) Outstandings, accruing past due, nonperforming loans and percentages of portfolio exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. (2) These vintages of loans accounted for $396 million , or 26 percent , and $536 million , or 28 percent , of nonperforming residential mortgage loans at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . Nonperforming residential mortgage loans decreased $342 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 primarily driven by sales. Of the nonperforming residential mortgage loans at September 30, 2019 , $586 million , or 38 percent , were current on contractual payments. Loans accruing past due 30 days or more decreased $85 million due to continued improvement in credit quality as well as loan sales in the non-core portfolio. Net charge-offs decreased $50 million to a net recovery of $38 million and $64 million to a net recovery of $51 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 primarily due to continued improvement in credit quality and recoveries from the sales of previously charged-off loans. Of the $208.8 billion in total residential mortgage loans outstanding at September 30, 2019 , as shown in Table 21 , 27 percent were originated as interest-only loans. The outstanding balance of interest-only residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period was $7.9 billion , or 14 percent , at September 30, 2019 . Residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period generally have experienced a higher rate of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status compared to the residential mortgage portfolio as a whole. At September 30, 2019 , $156 million , or two percent , of outstanding interest-only residential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $1.1 billion , or one percent , for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, at September 30, 2019 , $301 million , or four percent , of outstanding interest-only residential mortgage loans that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming, of which $97 million were contractually current, compared to $1.6 billion , or one percent , for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. Loans that have yet to enter the amortization period in our interest-only residential mortgage portfolio are primarily well-collateralized loans to our wealth management clients and have an interest-only period of three to ten years. Approximately 93 percent of these loans that have yet to enter the amortization period will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2022 or later. Table 22 presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the residential mortgage portfolio. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) within California represented 16 percent of outstandings at both September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 13 percent of outstandings at both September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 .

(3) Amounts exclude the fully-insured loan portfolio. 29 Bank of America Home Equity At September 30, 2019 , the home equity portfolio made up nine percent of the consumer portfolio and was comprised of home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), home equity loans and reverse mortgages. At September 30, 2019 , our HELOC portfolio had an outstanding balance of $38.7 billion , or 93 percent of the total home equity portfolio, compared to $44.3 billion , or 92 percent , at December 31, 2018 . HELOCs generally have an initial draw period of 10 years, and after the initial draw period ends, the loans generally convert to 15- or 20-year amortizing loans. At September 30, 2019 , our home equity loan portfolio had an outstanding balance of $1.3 billion , or three percent of the total home equity portfolio, compared to $1.8 billion , or four percent , at December 31, 2018 . Home equity loans are almost all fixed-rate loans with amortizing payment terms of 10 to 30 years, and of the $1.3 billion at September 30, 2019 , 71 percent have 25- to 30-year terms. At September 30, 2019 , our reverse mortgage portfolio had an outstanding balance of $1.6 billion , or four percent of the total home equity portfolio, compared to $2.2 billion , also four percent , at December 31, 2018 . We no longer originate home equity loans or reverse mortgages. At September 30, 2019 , 79 percent of the home equity portfolio was in Consumer Banking , 13 percent was in All Other and the remainder of the portfolio was primarily in GWIM . Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased $6.7 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 primarily due to paydowns and loan sales of $1.9 billion outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines. Of the total home equity portfolio at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , $15.3 billion , or 37 percent , and $17.3 billion , or 36 percent , were in first-lien positions. At September 30, 2019 , outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio that were in a second-lien or more junior-lien position and where we also held the first-lien loan totaled $7.1 billion , or 17 percent of our total home equity portfolio. Unused HELOCs totaled $43.3 billion at September 30, 2019 compared to $43.1 billion at December 31, 2018 . The increase was primarily driven by the impact of lower utilization of open lines and new production partially offset by customers choosing to close accounts. The HELOC utilization rate was 47 percent and 51 percent at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . Table 23 presents certain home equity portfolio key credit statistics. Table 23 Home Equity Key Credit Statistics (1) (Dollars in millions) September 30 2019 December 31 2018 Outstandings $ 41,574 $ 48,286 Accruing past due 30 days or more (2) 224 363 Nonperforming loans (2) 585 1,893 Percent of portfolio Refreshed CLTV greater than 90 but less than or equal to 100 2 % 2 % Refreshed CLTV greater than 100 2 3 Refreshed FICO below 620 3 5 2006 and 2007 vintages (3) 19 22 (1) Outstandings, accruing past due, nonperforming loans and percentages of the portfolio exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. (2) Accruing past due 30 days or more include $32 million and $48 million and nonperforming loans include $61 million and $218 million of loans where we serviced the underlying first lien at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . (3) These vintages of loans have higher refreshed combined loan-to-value (CLTV) ratios and accounted for 35 percent and 49 percent of nonperforming home equity loans at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . Nonperforming outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased $1.3 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 as outflows, primarily sales, outpaced new inflows. Of the nonperforming home equity loans at September 30, 2019 , $266 million , or 45 percent , were current on contractual payments. Nonperforming loans that are contractually current primarily consist of collateral-dependent TDRs, including those that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, junior-lien loans where the underlying first lien is 90 days or more past due, as well as loans that have not yet demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance following a TDR. We estimate that approximately $67 million of junior-lien loans had first-lien loans that were 90 days or more past due. In addition, $172 million , or 29 percent , of nonperforming home equity loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell. Accruing loans that were 30 days or more past due decreased $139 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 . Net charge-offs decreased $182 million to a net recovery of $202 million , and $359 million to a net recovery of $346 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 primarily driven by recoveries from the sales of previously charged off non-core home equity loans. Of the $41.6 billion in total home equity portfolio outstandings at September 30, 2019 , as shown in Table 23 , 17 percent require interest-only payments. The outstanding balance of HELOCs that have reached the end of their draw period and have entered the amortization period was $12.3 billion at September 30, 2019 . The HELOCs that have entered the amortization period have experienced a higher percentage of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status when compared to the HELOC portfolio as a whole. At September 30, 2019 , $162 million , or one percent , of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more. In addition, at September 30, 2019 , $518 million , or four percent , were nonperforming. For more information on HELOC amortization, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Although we do not actively track how many of our home equity customers pay only the minimum amount due on their home equity loans and lines, we can infer some of this information through a review of our HELOC portfolio that we service and that is still in its revolving period. During the three months ended September 30, 2019 , 26 percent of these customers with an outstanding balance did not pay any principal on their HELOCs. Bank of America 30 Table 24 presents outstandings, nonperforming balances and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the home equity portfolio. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 13 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California made up 11 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 .

U.S. Credit Card At September 30, 2019 , 97 percent of the U.S. credit card portfolio was managed in Consumer Banking with the remainder in GWIM . Outstandings in the U.S. credit card portfolio decreased $3.4 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to $94.9 billion due to a seasonal decline in purchase volumes. Net charge-offs increased $19 million to $717 million and $86 million to $2.2 billion during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 due to portfolio seasoning. U.S. credit card loans 30 days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased $52 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased $34 million , driven by seasonal declines. Unused lines of credit for U.S. credit card totaled $339.7 billion and $334.8 billion at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . The increase in unused lines was driven by seasonally lower purchase volumes, as well as account growth and lines of credit increases. Table 25 presents certain state concentrations for the U.S. credit card portfolio.

Outstandings in the direct/indirect portfolio decreased $330 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to $90.8 billion primarily due to declines in securities-based lending driven by repayments and lower draws. Net charge-offs increased $34 million to $76 million , and $28 million to $170 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 .

During the nine months ended September 30, 2019 , nonperforming consumer loans decreased $1.7 billion to $2.2 billion primarily driven by loan sales of $1.4 billion . At September 30, 2019 , $678 million , or 31 percent , of nonperforming loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to their estimated property value less costs to sell. In addition, at September 30, 2019 , $902 million , or 41 percent , of nonperforming consumer loans were modified and are now current after successful trial periods, or are current loans classified as nonperforming loans in accordance with applicable policies. Foreclosed properties decreased $56 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to $188 million as liquidations outpaced additions. Nonperforming loans also include certain loans that have been modified in TDRs where economic concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. Nonperforming TDRs are included in Table 27 .

(2) Residential mortgage performing TDRs include $2.2 billion and $2.8 billion of loans that were fully-insured at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . (3) At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , home equity TDRs deemed collateral dependent totaled $478 million and $1.3 billion , and include $229 million and $961 million of loans classified as nonperforming and $249 million and $322 million of loans classified as performing. Bank of America 32 In addition to modifying consumer real estate loans, we work with customers who are experiencing financial difficulty by modifying credit card and other consumer loans. Credit card and other consumer loan modifications generally involve a reduction in the customer interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months, all of which are considered TDRs (the renegotiated TDR portfolio). Modifications of credit card and other consumer loans are made through renegotiation programs utilizing direct customer contact, but may also utilize external renegotiation programs. The renegotiated TDR portfolio is excluded in large part from Table 27 as substantially all of the loans remain on accrual status until either charged off or paid in full. At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , our renegotiated TDR portfolio was $657 million and $566 million , of which $558 million and $481 million were current or less than 30 days past due under the modified terms. The increase in the renegotiated TDR portfolio was primarily driven by new renegotiated enrollments outpacing runoff of existing portfolios. Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Commercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal that concentrations of credit exposure continue to be aligned with our risk appetite. We review, measure and manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, customer relationship and loan size. We also review, measure and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property type. In addition, within our non-U.S. portfolio, we evaluate exposures by region and by country. Tables 33 , 36 and 39 summarize our concentrations. We also utilize syndications of exposure to third parties, loan sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio. For more information on our industry concentrations, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Industry Concentrations on page 36 and Table 36 . For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status and net charge-offs for the commercial portfolio, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Commercial Credit Portfolio During the nine months ended September 30, 2019 , credit quality among large corporate and middle-market borrowers in our commercial and industrial portfolio remained strong. Credit quality of commercial real estate borrowers in most sectors remained stable with conservative LTV ratios. However, some of the real estate markets experienced slowing tenant demand and decelerating rental income. Total commercial utilized credit exposure increased $16.2 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to $637.2 billion driven by higher loans and leases. The utilization rate for loans and leases, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and financial guarantees, and commercial letters of credit, in the aggregate, was 58 percent at September 30, 2019 and 59 percent at December 31, 2018 . Table 29 presents commercial credit exposure by type for utilized, unfunded and total binding committed credit exposure. Commercial utilized credit exposure includes SBLCs and financial guarantees and commercial letters of credit that have been issued and for which we are legally bound to advance funds under prescribed conditions during a specified time period, and excludes exposure related to trading account assets. Although funds have not yet been advanced, these exposure types are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes.

Criticized exposure corresponds to the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful asset categories as defined by regulatory authorities. Total commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure increased $774 million , or seven percent , during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 driven by a small number of client downgrades across various industries and was not indicative of broader issues in the portfolio. At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , 90 percent and 91 percent of commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure was secured.

Bank of America 34 Commercial and Industrial Commercial and industrial loans include U.S. commercial and non-U.S. commercial portfolios. U.S. Commercial At September 30, 2019 , 69 percent of the U.S. commercial loan portfolio, excluding small business, was managed in Global Banking, 16 percent in Global Markets , 13 percent in GWIM (generally business-purpose loans for high net worth clients) and the remainder primarily in Consumer Banking . U.S. commercial loans increased $11.7 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 , across lines of business. Nonperforming U.S. commercial loans increased $172 million and reservable criticized utilized exposure increased $803 million , or 10 percent , driven by a small number of client downgrades across various industries. Non-U.S. Commercial At September 30, 2019 , 84 percent of the non-U.S. commercial loan portfolio was managed in Global Banking and 16 percent in Global Markets . Non-U.S. commercial loans increased $2.3 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 , primarily in Global Banking . For more information on the non-U.S. commercial portfolio, see Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 38 . Commercial Real Estate Commercial real estate primarily includes commercial loans secured by non-owner-occupied real estate and is dependent on the sale or lease of the real estate as the primary source of repayment. Outstanding loans increased $2.0 billion , or three percent , during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to $62.8 billion due to new originations slightly outpacing paydowns. The portfolio remains diversified across property types and geographic regions. California represented the largest state concentration at 24 percent and 23 percent of the commercial real estate portfolio at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . The commercial real estate portfolio is predominantly managed in Global Banking and consists of loans made primarily to public and private developers, and commercial real estate firms. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 , we continued to see low default rates and solid credit quality in both the residential and non-residential portfolios. We use a number of proactive risk mitigation initiatives to reduce adversely rated exposure in the commercial real estate portfolio, including transfers of deteriorating exposures to management by independent special asset officers and the pursuit of loan restructurings or asset sales to achieve the best results for our customers and the Corporation.

U.S. Small Business Commercial The U.S. small business commercial loan portfolio is comprised of small business card loans and small business loans managed in Consumer Banking . Credit card-related products were 53 percent and 51 percent of the U.S. small business commercial portfolio at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . Of the U.S. small business commercial net charge-offs, 92 percent and 95 percent were credit card-related products for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to 95 percent and 94 percent for same periods in 2018 . Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity Table 34 presents the nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 . Nonperforming loans do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. During the nine months ended September 30, 2019 , nonperforming commercial loans and leases increased $185 million to $1.3 billion . At September 30, 2019 , 93 percent of commercial nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties were 35 Bank of America secured and 56 percent were contractually current. Commercial nonperforming loans were carried at 90 percent of their unpaid principal balance before consideration of the allowance for loan and lease losses as the carrying value of these loans has been reduced to the estimated collateral value less costs to sell.

(3) Commercial loans and leases may be returned to performing status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected, or when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection. TDRs are generally classified as performing after a sustained period of demonstrated payment performance. (4) Outstanding commercial loans exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. Table 35 presents our commercial TDRs by product type and performing status. U.S. small business commercial TDRs are comprised of renegotiated small business card loans and small business loans. The renegotiated small business card loans are not classified as nonperforming as they are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due.

Our commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. Total commercial committed exposure increased $38.1 billion , or four percent, during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to $1.0 trillion . The increase in commercial committed exposure was concentrated in the Real estate, Financial markets infrastructure, and Capital goods industry sectors. Increases were partially offset by decreased exposure to the Global commercial banks, Insurance, and Commercial services and supplies industry sectors. For information on industry limits, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management - Industry Concentrations in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Asset managers and funds, our largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $109.8 billion , increased $2.0 billion , or two percent , during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 . Real estate, our second largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $93.6 billion , increased $7.1 billion , or eight percent , during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 . This growth occurred primarily in the category of property developers and owners, partially offset by declines in REITs and multiple-use and all other property types. Capital goods, our third largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $79.3 billion , increased $4.2 billion , or six percent , during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 with the growth largely occurring in the machinery and trading companies and distributors industry categories, partially offset by a decrease in large conglomerates.

For purposes of this table, the real estate industry is defined based on the primary business activity of the borrowers or counterparties using operating cash flows and primary source of repayment as key factors. (4) Represents net notional credit protection purchased to hedge funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures. For additional information, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Risk Mitigation . Risk Mitigation We purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. To lower the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, we may add credit exposure within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, was $3.9 billion and $2.7 billion . We recorded net losses on these positions of $15 million and $93 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to net losses of $33 million and $43 million for the same periods in 2018 on these positions. The gains and losses on these instruments were offset by gains and losses on the related exposures.

Non-U.S. Portfolio Our non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios are subject to country risk. We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in government policies. A risk management framework is in place to measure, monitor and manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. In addition to the direct risk of doing business in a country, we also are exposed to indirect country risks (e.g., related to the collateral received on secured financing transactions or related to client clearing activities). These indirect exposures are managed in the normal course of business through credit, market and operational risk governance, rather than through country risk governance. Table 39 presents our 20 largest non-U.S. country exposures at September 30, 2019 . These exposures accounted for 89 percent of our total non-U.S. exposure at both September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . Net country exposure for these 20 countries increased $10.9 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 , primarily driven by increased sovereign and corporate exposure across multiple countries.

Additionally, in light of ongoing trade tensions, we continue to closely monitor our exposures to tariff-sensitive regions and industries, particularly to countries that account for a large percentage of U.S. trade, such as China. Our largest emerging market country exposure at September 30, 2019 was China, with net exposure of $14.5 billion, concentrated in large state-owned companies, subsidiaries of multinational corporations and commercial banks. The outlook for policy direction and therefore economic performance in the EU remains uncertain as a consequence of reduced political cohesion among EU countries. Additionally, we believe that the uncertainty in the U.K. ability to negotiate a favorable exit from the EU will further weigh on economic performance. For additional information, see Executive Summary Recent Developments U.K. Exit from the EU on page 3 . Our largest EU country exposure at September 30, 2019 was the U.K. with net exposure of $55.6 billion , which represents a $696 million increase from December 31, 2018 . Our second largest EU exposure was Germany with net exposure of $26.1 billion , which represents a $2.6 billion decrease from December 31, 2018 . The decrease in Germany was primarily driven by a reduction in sovereign exposure. Bank of America 38 Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses increased $63 million to $779 million , and $272 million to $2.6 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 . The provision for credit losses was $32 million and $40 million lower than net charge-offs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 , resulting in a decrease in the allowance for credit losses. This compared to a decrease of $216 million and $462 million in the allowance for credit losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 . Net charge-offs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 were $811 million and $2.7 billion compared to $932 million and $2.8 billion for the same periods in 2018. The provision for credit losses for the consumer portfolio decreased $146 million to $564 million and $181 million to $2.0 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 . The decrease was primarily driven by consumer real estate loan sales. The provision for credit losses for the commercial portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, increased $209 million to $215 million and $453 million to $615 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 . The increase was due in part to energy releases in the prior-year periods. Allowance for Credit Losses Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 , the factors that impacted the allowance for loan and lease losses included improvement in the credit quality of the consumer real estate portfolios driven by continuing improvements in the U.S. economy and strong labor markets, proactive credit risk management initiatives and the impact of high credit quality originations. Evidencing the improvements in the U.S. economy and strong labor markets are low levels of unemployment and increases in home prices. In addition to these improvements, in the consumer portfolio, nonperforming consumer loans decreased $1.7 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 as loan sales, returns to performing status and paydowns continued to outpace new nonaccrual loans. The allowance for loan and lease losses for the consumer portfolio, as presented in Table 41 , was $4.6 billion at September 30, 2019 , a decrease of $226 million from December 31, 2018 . The decrease was primarily in the consumer real estate portfolio, partially offset by an increase in the U.S. credit card portfolio. The reduction in the allowance for the consumer real estate portfolio was due to improved home prices, lower nonperforming loans and a decrease in loan balances in our non-core portfolio. The increase in the allowance for the U.S. credit card portfolio was driven primarily by continued portfolio seasoning. The allowance for loan and lease losses for the commercial portfolio, as presented in Table 41 , was $4.9 billion at September 30, 2019 , an increase of $58 million from December 31, 2018 . Commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure increased to $11.8 billion at September 30, 2019 from $11.1 billion (to 2.17 percent from 2.08 percent of total commercial reservable utilized exposure) at December 31, 2018 , and nonperforming commercial loans increased to $1.3 billion at September 30, 2019 from $1.1 billion (to 0.25 percent from 0.22 percent of outstanding commercial loans excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option) at December 31, 2018 with the increases spread across multiple industries. See Tables 30 , 31 and 32 for more details on key commercial credit statistics. The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding was 0.98 percent at September 30, 2019 compared to 1.02 percent at December 31, 2018 . For more information on the allowance for loan and lease losses, see Allowance for Credit Losses in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new accounting standard regarding the measurement of the allowance for credit losses that will be effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2020. Upon adoption of the standard on January 1, 2020, we expect that, based on current expectations of future economic conditions, our allowance for credit losses on loans and leases may increase up to approximately 30 percent from our allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2019 , as disclosed herein, with a large portion of that increase driven by the U.S. credit card portfolio. The increase from the previously disclosed expectation of up to 20 percent was driven by refinements to certain models and methodologies along with the third-quarter 2019 loan sales, which reduced the expected recoveries on previously charged-off loans as the recoveries were realized upon sale. The ultimate impact upon adoption will depend on the characteristics of the Corporation portfolios, macroeconomic conditions and forecasts, and the finalized validation of models and methodologies, as well as other management judgments. For additional information regarding this new accounting standard, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we also estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments such as letters of credit, financial guarantees, unfunded bankers acceptances and binding loan commitments, excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value option. For more information on the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, see Allowance for Credit Losses in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . The reserve for unfunded lending commitments was $809 million at September 30, 2019 compared to $797 million at December 31, 2018 .

Trading Risk Management To evaluate risks in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of revenues generated by individual positions as well as portfolios of positions. VaR is a common statistic used to measure market risk. Our primary VaR statistic is equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level, which means that for a VaR with a one-day holding period, there should not be losses in excess of VaR, on average, 99 out of 100 trading days. Table 42 presents the total market-based portfolio VaR which is the combination of the total covered positions (and less liquid trading positions) portfolio and the fair value option portfolio. For more information on our trading risk management process and on the market risk VaR for trading activities, see Trading Risk Management in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . The total market-based portfolio VaR results in Table 42 include market risk to which we are exposed from all business segments, excluding credit valuation adjustment (CVA), DVA and related hedges. The majority of this portfolio is within the Global Markets segment. Table 42 presents period-end, average, high and low daily trading VaR for the three months ended September 30, 2019 , June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018 , as well as average daily trading VaR for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 using a 99 percent confidence level. The amounts disclosed in Table 42 and Table 43 align to the view of covered positions used in the Basel 3 capital calculations. Foreign exchange and commodity positions are always considered covered positions, regardless of trading or banking treatment for the trade, except for structural foreign currency positions that are excluded with prior regulatory approval. The average total covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio VaR increased for the three months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 due to an increase in equity risk, partially offset by a decrease in interest rate risk.

Therefore the impact from less liquid exposures and the amount of portfolio diversification, which is the difference between the total portfolio and the sum of the individual components, is not relevant. 41 Bank of America The graph below presents the daily covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio VaR for the previous five quarters, corresponding to the data in Table 42 . Additional VaR statistics produced within our single VaR model are provided in Table 43 at the same level of detail as in Table 42 . Evaluating VaR with additional statistics allows for an increased understanding of the risks in the portfolio as the historical market data used in the VaR calculation does not necessarily follow a predefined statistical distribution.

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 , there were no days in which there was a backtesting excess for our total covered portfolio VaR, utilizing a one-day holding period. Total Trading-related Revenue Total trading-related revenue, excluding brokerage fees, and CVA, DVA and funding valuation adjustment gains (losses), represents the total amount earned from trading positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. For additional information, see Trading Risk Management Total Trading-related Revenue in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . The following histogram is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2019 and March 31, 2019 . During the three months ended September 30, 2019 , positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 92 percent of the trading days, of which 70 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million and the largest loss was $35 million. This compares to the three months ended June 30, 2019 where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 100 percent of the trading days, of which 91 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million. During the three months ended March 31, 2019 , positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 100 percent of the trading days of which 89 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million. Bank of America 42 Trading Portfolio Stress Testing Because the very nature of a VaR model suggests results can exceed our estimates and it is dependent on a limited historical window, we also stress test our portfolio using scenario analysis. This analysis estimates the change in the value of our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements. For additional information, see Trading Risk Management Trading Portfolio Stress Testing in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book The following discussion presents net interest income for banking book activities. For additional information, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Table 44 presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . Table 44 Forward Rates September 30, 2019 Federal Funds Three-month LIBOR 10-Year Swap Spot rates 2.00 % 2.09 % 1.56 % 12-month forward rates 1.50 1.47 1.56 December 31, 2018 Spot rates 2.50 % 2.81 % 2.71 % 12-month forward rates 2.50 2.64 2.75 Table 45 shows the pretax impact to forecasted net interest income over the next 12 months from September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , resulting from instantaneous parallel and non-parallel shocks to the market-based forward curve. Periodically we evaluate the scenarios presented so that they are meaningful in the context of the current rate environment. In the nine months ended September 30, 2019 , the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet increased primarily due to decreases in interest rates. We continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel move in interest rates with the majority of that impact coming from the short end of the yield curve. Additionally, higher interest rates impact the fair value of debt securities and, accordingly, for debt securities classified as AFS, may adversely affect accumulated OCI and thus capital levels under the Basel 3 capital rules. Under instantaneous upward parallel shifts, the near-term adverse impact to Basel 3 capital is reduced over time by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income. For more information on Basel 3, see Capital Management Regulatory Capital on page 20 . Table 45 Estimated Banking Book Net Interest Income Sensitivity to Curve Changes Short Rate (bps) Long Rate (bps) September 30 2019 December 31 2018 (Dollars in millions) Parallel Shifts +100 bps instantaneous shift +100 +100 $ 4,576 $ 2,833 -100 bps instantaneous shift -100 -100 (6,479 ) (4,280 ) Flatteners Short-end instantaneous change +100 2,696 2,158 Long-end instantaneous change -100 (3,050 ) (1,618 ) Steepeners Short-end instantaneous change -100 (3,343 ) (2,648 ) Long-end instantaneous change +100 1,917 675 The sensitivity analysis in Table 45 assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates. As part of our ALM activities, we use securities, certain residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity. The behavior of our deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income. The sensitivity analysis in Table 45 assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce our benefit in those scenarios. Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative Contracts Interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts are utilized in our ALM activities and serve as an efficient tool to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk. We use derivatives to hedge the variability in cash flows or changes in fair value on our balance sheet due to interest rate and foreign exchange components. For more information on our hedging activities, see Note 3 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . For more information on interest rate contracts and risk management, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . We use interest rate derivative instruments to hedge the variability in the cash flows of our assets and liabilities and other forecasted transactions (collectively referred to as cash flow hedges). The net losses on both open and terminated cash flow hedge derivative instruments recorded in accumulated OCI were $452 million and $1.3 billion , on a pretax basis, at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . These net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the same period as the hedged cash flows affect earnings and will decrease income or increase expense on the respective hedged cash flows. Assuming no change in open cash flow derivative hedge positions and no changes in prices or interest rates beyond what is implied in forward yield curves at September 30, 2019 , the pretax net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings as follows: 21 percent within the next year, 33 percent in years two through five and 26 percent in years six through ten, with the remaining 20 percent 43 Bank of America thereafter. For more information on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, see Note 3 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . We hedge our net investment in non-U.S. operations determined to have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar using forward foreign exchange contracts that typically settle in less than 180 days, cross-currency basis swaps and foreign exchange options. We recorded net after-tax losses on derivatives in accumulated OCI associated with net investment hedges which were offset by gains on our net investments in consolidated non-U.S. entities at September 30, 2019 . Table 46 presents derivatives utilized in our ALM activities and shows the notional amount, fair value, weighted-average receive-fixed and pay-fixed rates, expected maturity and average estimated durations of our open ALM derivatives at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . These amounts do not include derivative hedges on our MSRs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2019 , the fair value of receive-fixed interest rate swaps increased while pay-fixed interest rates swaps decreased, driven by lower swap rates.

Bank of America 44 Mortgage Banking Risk Management We originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. We determine whether loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate. Changes in interest rates impact the value of interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and the related residential mortgage loans held for sale (LHFS), as well as the value of the MSRs. Because the interest rate risks of these hedged items offset, we combine them into one overall hedged item with one combined economic hedge portfolio consisting of derivative contracts and securities. For more information on IRLCs and the related residential mortgage LHFS, see Mortgage Banking Risk Management in the MD&A of the Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K . During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 , we recorded gains of $78 million and $217 million related to the change in fair value of the MSRs, IRLCs and LHFS, net of gains and losses on the hedge portfolio, compared to gains of $61 million and $190 million for the same periods in 2018. For more information on MSRs, see Note 15 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Complex Accounting Estimates Our significant accounting principles are essential in understanding the MD&A. Many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments.
