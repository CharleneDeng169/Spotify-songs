Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further detail on current year results. United States U.S. Resource Plays Eagle Ford We have been operating in the South Texas Eagle Ford play since 2011, where our acreage is located in Karnes, Atascosa, Gonzales, Lavaca, DeWitt, Bee and Live Oak Counties. We operate 32 central gathering and treating facilities across the play that support more than 1,600 producing wells. We also own and operate the Sugarloaf gathering system, a 42-mile natural gas pipeline through the heart of our acreage in Karnes and Atascosa Counties. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2022, we acquired approximately 130,000 net proved and unproved acres, with an average 97% working interest, and approximately 700 existing wells from Ensign Natural Resources. Bakken We have been operating in the Williston Basin since 2006. The majority of our core acreage is within McKenzie, Mountrail and Dunn Counties in North Dakota targeting the Middle Bakken and Three Forks reservoirs. Oklahoma With a history in Oklahoma that dates back more than 100 years, our primary focus has been development in the STACK Meramec and SCOOP Woodford, while progressing delineation of other plays across our acreage. We primarily hold net acreage with rights to the Woodford, Springer, Meramec, Osage and other prospect intervals, with a majority of this in the SCOOP and STACK. Permian We have been operating in the Northern Delaware basin, which is located within the greater Permian area, since closing on two major acquisitions in 2017. Our focus has been to advance our position through execution of strategic acreage trades, progress early delineation and development of our acreage, improve our cost structure and secure midstream solutions. We have the majority of our acreage in Eddy and Lea counties primarily in the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring New Mexico plays. International Segment We are engaged in oil and gas exploration, development and production activities in E.G. We include the results of our investments in a LPG processing plant and LNG and methanol production operations in E.G. in our International segment. International Equatorial Guinea We own a 63% and an 80% operated working interest in two separate production sharing contracts (Alba PSC and Block D PSC, respectively), which we produce from the Alba field, located offshore E.G. These production sharing contracts were unitized in 2017 resulting in the Alba Unit in which we own a 64% operated working interest. Equatorial Guinea Gas Processing The following facilities located on Bioko Island, all accounted for as equity method investments, allow us to further monetize natural gas production from the Alba field. We own a 52% interest in Alba Plant LLC, which operates an onshore LPG processing plant. Alba field natural gas is processed by the LPG plant under a fixed-price long-term contract. The LPG plant extracts condensate and LPG from the natural gas stream and uses some of the remaining dry natural gas in its operations. We also own 56% of EGHoldings, which operates a 3.7 mmta LNG production facility. Under EGHoldings current sales and purchase agreement, which ends on December 31, 2023, the purchaser takes delivery of the LNG on Bioko Island, with pricing linked principally to the Henry Hub index. We are progressing new LNG agreements expected to begin on January 1, 2024, and our intention is to secure increased exposure to global LNG market prices. EGHoldings gross sales of LNG from this production facility totaled approximately 2 mmta in 2022. Additionally, Alba Plant LLC and EGHoldings process the third-party gas from the Alen field under a combination of a tolling fee and profit-sharing arrangement, the benefits of which are included in our respective share of income from equity method investments. Efforts are underway to secure additional regional third-party gas volumes to be processed by Alba Plant LLC and EGHoldings thereby creating a regional gas hub in E.G. We also own 45% of AMPCO, which operates a methanol plant. AMPCO had gross sales totaling approximately 2,351 mtd in 2022. Methanol production is sold to customers in Europe and the U.S. 8 Table of Content s Reserves Proved reserves are required to be disclosed by continent and by country if the proved reserves related to any geographic area, on an oil equivalent barrel basis, represent 15% or more of our total proved reserves. A geographic area can be an individual country, group of countries within a continent, or a continent. For additional detail on reserves, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Supplementary Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities . The following tables set forth estimated quantities of our total proved crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas reserves based upon SEC pricing for the year-ended December 31, 2022.

In the case of undeveloped properties, an investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisition. Drilling title opinions are usually prepared before commencement of drilling operations. Our title to properties may be subject to burdens such as royalty, overriding royalty, carried, net profits, working and other similar interests and contractual arrangements customary in the industry. In addition, our interests may be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws or burdens such as net profits interests, liens related to operating agreements, development obligations or capital commitments under international production sharing contracts or exploration licenses. The following table sets forth, by geographic area, the gross and net developed and undeveloped acreage held as of December 31, 2022.

(b) Primarily represents fixed prices under long-term contracts with Alba Plant LLC, AMPCO and/or EGHoldings, which are equity method investees. We include our share of income from each of these equity method investees in our International segment. (c) Taxes other than income (such as production, severance and property taxes) are excluded; however, shipping and handling as well as other operating expenses are included in the production costs used in this calculation. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Supplementary Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities Results of Operations for Oil and Gas Production Activities for more information regarding production costs. Marketing Our reportable operating segments include activities related to the marketing and transportation of substantially all of our crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas. These activities include the transportation of production to market centers, the sale of commodities to third parties and the storage of production. We balance our various sales, storage and transportation positions in order to aggregate volumes to satisfy transportation commitments and to achieve flexibility within product types and delivery points. Such activities can include the purchase of commodities from third parties for resale. Major Customers We are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by counterparties, a significant portion of which are concentrated in energy-related industries. The creditworthiness of customers and other counterparties is subject to continuous review, and includes the use of master netting agreements, where appropriate. Customers and their respective affiliates who accounted for 10% or more of our total commodity sales were as follows: December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Percentage of Total Commodity Sales Marathon Petroleum Corporation 22 % 17 % 13 % Valero Marketing and Supply 12 % 10 % N/A Trafigura Groupe Pte. Ltd. 10 % N/A N/A Koch Resources LLC N/A N/A 12 % 13 Table of Content s Gross Delivery Commitments We have commitments to customers to deliver gross quantities of crude oil and condensate and NGLs under a variety of contracts. As of December 31, 2022, the contracts for fixed and determinable quantities were at variable, market-based pricing and related primarily to the following commitments: 2023 2024 2025 Thereafter Commitment Period Through Eagle Ford Crude and condensate (mbbld) 27 2023 Natural gas liquids (mbbld) 4 2023 Bakken Crude and condensate (mbbld) 10 10 10 5 - 10 2027 All of these contracts provide the option of delivering third-party volumes or paying a monetary shortfall penalty if production is inadequate to satisfy our commitment. In addition to the contracts discussed above, we have entered into numerous agreements for transportation and processing of our equity production. Some of these contracts have volumetric requirements which could require monetary shortfall penalties if our production is inadequate to meet the terms. Competition Competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry, and we compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, national oil companies, and to a lesser extent, companies that supply alternative sources of energy. We compete, in particular, for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties, in the exploration for and development of new reserves, the marketing and delivery of our production into worldwide commodity markets and for the labor and equipment required for exploration and development of those properties. Principal methods of competing include geological, geophysical and engineering research and technology, experience and expertise, economic analysis in connection with portfolio management and safely operating oil and gas producing properties. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for discussion of specific areas in which we compete and related risks. Government Regulations Our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations, including those related to oil and gas exploration and production and to the protection of health, environment and safety. New laws have been enacted or are otherwise being considered and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis. The costs of compliance with these new laws and regulations cannot be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more defined. However, the current federal administration has begun implementing policies to increase regulation of oil and gas activity with the express purpose of transitioning the economy to lower-carbon sources of energy consistent with the administration focus on climate change. This administration climate policies have been wide-ranging and have included both legislative and executive branch action to address climate change and provide incentives to accelerate development of renewable resources. The current administration has issued a number of executive and temporary orders and policy changes that address broad ranging issues including climate change, oil and gas activities on federal lands, infrastructure and environmental justice. These actions have been followed by a number of related regulatory proposals that are in various stages of the rulemaking process including: more stringent and potentially overlapping regulations of emissions from oil and gas activities, expected further expansion of the definition of Waters of the U.S., increased barriers to access to federal lands for oil and gas development, increased protection for endangered species, more stringent permitting requirements for oil and gas facilities, additional disclosures for climate change risks and implementing regulations for provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. We expect these regulatory changes, if finalized, may increase our administrative costs and affect the issuance of permits and/or agency approvals. If permits and approvals are not issued, or if unfavorable restrictions or conditions are imposed on our drilling activities due to these orders or policy changes, we may not be able to conduct our operations as planned. At this time, we do not expect that the proposed or anticipated rulemakings will affect our operations materially differently than they would affect other companies with similar operations, size and financial strength. However, the finalized versions of the proposed rules or new rules could have a material adverse impact on our business individually or collectively, depending on the final terms and timing of implementation. States in which we operate are also considering making proposals to address climate change or increase regulation of the oil and gas industry. While there are not currently climate-related regulations proposed or pending at the state level in our operating areas that we believe will result in material capital, operating, tax or other costs to the business at this time, such regulations could be proposed and/or passed into law in 2023 or beyond. Other regulations currently in place could be withdrawn and replaced with more stringent requirements in the future. 14 Table of Content s The Health, Environmental, Safety and Corporate Responsibility Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing our position on public issues, including environmental, health and safety matters. Our Corporate Health, Environment, Safety and Security organization is responsible for ensuring that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that support and foster our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Committees comprised of certain of our officers review our overall performance associated with various environmental compliance programs. We also have a Corporate Emergency Response Team that oversees our response to any major environmental or other emergency incident involving us or any of our properties. Environmental Remediation and Waste Management Our business is subject to laws relating to remediation of environmental pollution and the storage, handling and disposal of waste. These laws, and their implementing regulations and other similar state and local laws and rules, can impose certain operational requirements for (i) minimization of pollution, (ii) monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping requirements or (iii) other operational or siting constraints on our business. These controls result in costs to remediate releases of regulated substances, including crude oil and produced water, into the environment, or require costs to remediate third-party sites to which we sent regulated substances for disposal. In some cases, these laws can impose strict liability for the entire cost of clean-up on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others (such as prior owners or operators of our assets) or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. We have incurred and will continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. Waste regulations include those for management, storage, transportation and disposal. Additional or expanded regulations relating to oilfield waste may be adopted in the future that potentially impact the costs of compliance, handling, management and availability of disposal options. Air and Climate Change Concerns about emissions from oil and gas activities including volatile organic compounds, carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases may affect us and other similarly situated companies operating in the oil and gas industry. As described in more detail below, several regulatory proposals seek to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. While we cannot fully evaluate potential impacts of such proposed rules until they are finalized, as part of our commitment to environmental stewardship and as required by law, we estimate and publicly report certain greenhouse gas emissions from our operations. We are also working to continuously improve the accuracy and completeness of these estimates. Finally, we have also undertaken initiatives to highlight our commitment to improving environmental performance, including introducing new quantitative goals for the near, medium and long-term time horizon across three core areas of focus: GHG intensity, methane intensity and gas capture. We have added a GHG emissions intensity target to our short-term incentive annual cash bonus scorecard to better reflect these initiatives. Government entities and other groups have filed lawsuits in several states and other jurisdictions seeking to hold a wide variety of companies that produce fossil fuels liable for the alleged impacts of the greenhouse gas emissions attributable to those fuels. The lawsuits allege damages as a result of climate change and the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and abatement under various tort theories. Marathon Oil has been named as a defendant in several of these lawsuits, along with numerous other companies. Similar lawsuits may be filed in other jurisdictions. While the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the claims made against us are without merit and will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow. In June 2016, the EPA finalized amendments to the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS), known as Subpart OOOOa, focused on achieving additional methane and volatile organic compound reductions from new and modified oil and natural gas production and transmission facilities. On November 15, 2021, the EPA issued a proposed rule intended to reduce methane emissions from new and existing oil and gas sources. The proposed rule would make the existing regulations in Subpart OOOOa more stringent and create a Subpart OOOOb to expand reduction requirements for new, modified and reconstructed oil and gas sources, including standards focusing on certain source types that have never been regulated under the Clean Air Act (including intermittent vent pneumatic controllers, associated gas and liquids unloading facilities). In addition, the proposed rule would establish Emissions Guidelines, creating a Subpart OOOOc that would require states to develop plans to reduce methane emissions from existing sources that must be at least as effective as presumptive standards set by the EPA. On November 15, 2022, the EPA issued a proposed rule supplementing the November 2021 proposed rule. Among other things, the November 2022 supplemental proposed rule removes an emissions monitoring exemption for small wellhead-only sites and creates a new third-party monitoring program to flag large emissions events, referred to in the proposed rule as super emitters . The EPA is expected to issue a final rule by late 2023. In mid-2021, the State of New Mexico implemented regulations that seek to reduce GHG emissions in the state. In November 2022, BLM proposed a rule requiring additional royalties on methane emissions and regulations designed to limit venting and flaring on public and tribal lands, and a final rule is expected by late 2023. 15 Table of Content s The EPA finalized a more stringent NAAQS for ozone in October 2015. States that contain any areas designated as non-attainment, and any tribes that chose to do so, were required to complete development of implementation plans. The EPA may in the future designate additional areas, including but not limited to portions of the Permian Basin, as non-attainment, impacting areas in which we operate. In January 2023, the EPA proposed a rule that would lower the annual particulate matter of less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5) NAAQS from the current 12 micrograms per meter cubed ( g/m 3 ) to a level between 9 g/m 3 and 10 g/m 3 , and comments are due by March 28, 2023. The implementation of this proposed limit, or the promulgation of a more stringent standard in the future, may result in an increase in costs for emission controls and requirements for additional monitoring and testing, as well as a more cumbersome permitting process. Although there may be an adverse financial impact (including compliance costs, potential permitting delays and increased regulatory requirements) associated with this revised regulation (if finalized), the extent and magnitude of that impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the present uncertainty regarding any additional measures and how they will be implemented. Hydraulic Fracturing Hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injecting water, sand and small volumes of chemicals into the wellbore to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock thousands of feet below the surface to facilitate higher flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. Our business uses this technique extensively throughout our operations. Hydraulic fracturing has been regulated at the state and local level through permitting and compliance requirements. The federal administration previously included as part of its platform actions that could amount to a de facto ban on hydraulic fracturing on federal lands and the EPA and other federal agencies, including the BLM, have previously made proposals that, if implemented, could either restrict the practice of hydraulic fracturing or subject the process to further regulation (and there is some question as to whether this could extend to tribal lands). Further, state and local-level initiatives may be proposed in regions with substantial shale resources to further regulate hydraulic fracturing practices, limit water withdrawals and water use, require disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents, restrict which additives may be used or implement temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing. Although there may be an adverse financial impact (including compliance costs, potential permitting delays and increased regulatory requirements) associated with these initiatives, the extent and magnitude of that impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the present uncertainty regarding any additional measures and how they will be implemented. Water In 2014, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ( Corps ) published proposed regulations which expand the scope of surface waters that are regulated under the federal CWA and its various programs known as WOTUS. In 2015, the EPA and the Corps issued a rule defining the scope of the EPA and the Corps jurisdiction over WOTUS, which never took effect before being replaced by the Navigable Waters Protection Rule ( NWPR ) in 2020. A coalition of states and cities, environmental groups and agricultural groups challenged the NWPR, which was vacated by a federal district court in August 2021. The EPA is undergoing a two-phase rulemaking process to redefine WOTUS, which could be impacted by the U.S. Supreme Court upcoming decision in Sackett v. EPA, a case regarding the proper test in determining whether wetlands qualify as WOTUS. A final rule, known as Rule 1 , was announced by the EPA and the Corps in December 2022. The EPA and the Corps are expected to propose a second rule, known as Rule 2 , further refining Rule 1, by November 2023 and issue a final rule by July 2024. Any expansion of CWA jurisdiction could result in additional costs of compliance as well as increased monitoring, recordkeeping and recording for some of our facilities. There is also increasing interest in nature-related matters beyond protected species, such as general biodiversity, which may similarly require us or our customers to incur costs or take other measures which may adversely impact our business or operations. Other Oil and Gas Regulations The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service has undertaken actions to rescind, revise or reinstate a number of wildlife-related regulations that relate to protection of endangered species and their habitats. Additional actions in this area are expected and may result in additional costs of compliance, as well as operational delays or siting challenges.

We believe our diversity of people, experiences and ideas provides us with a business advantage. We are committed to fair and nondiscriminatory hiring and to celebrating the diversity of our workforce. Our Talent Landscape As of December 31, 2022, we had 1,570 active, full-time employees worldwide. Approximately 73% of our full-time workforce was based in the United States with 27% in Equatorial Guinea. Through recruiting, training, workforce integration, education and vocational programs, we strive to have a workforce reflective of the areas in which we operate. In 2022 and as a result of intentional nationalization efforts, 93% of our MEGPL workforce was Equatoguinean. For the U.S. workforce, our average tenure for full-time employees as of December 31, 2022 was 8 years, with 31% of our full-time population having 10 or more years of experience. Women and people of color each accounted for 32% of our U.S. full-time workforce. We encourage diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) and cultivate our collaborative team environment by making training courses on diversity and inclusive leadership available to all employees. We support Employee Resource Groups ( ERGs ) to promote diverse perspectives, encourage networking and allow continuous development activities. We added two new ERGs in 2022 and expanded voluntary enterprise-wide DEI training to continue to foster our One Team culture. We also continued to support the mental well-being of our employees by focusing on educating and empowering our employees to talk about mental wellness and promoting the resources available to them, including new benefit offerings in 2022. Additionally, we continued to offer our workforce flexibility program that preserves our collaborative One Team culture while also providing options for our employees to better manage their career, work-life balance and overall well-being. Further, we committed time this year to collect feedback from our employees to capture the unique characteristics that attract people to Marathon Oil and keep our employees engaged as part of our One Team culture. 17 Table of Content s Recognizing the cyclical nature of our business and the dynamic talent demands, we conduct a proactive risk analysis annually as part of our Enterprise Risk Management process, including a multi-year view of any potential talent risks to ensure we are prepared to respond to the macro- environment while setting ourselves up for long-term success. We fully leverage our common asset team organizational structure to drive knowledge sharing, collaboration and talent deployment across these teams which we believe results in efficiency gains and enhanced execution. We utilize a managed service provider to oversee efficient administration, equitable treatment and compliance auditing of our contingent labor workforce. Health, Environment and Safety We believe safety is a core value and engrained in all aspects of our business. We uphold our safety and health culture by attracting, developing and retaining individuals and partners who share our commitment to operational excellence. Marathon Oil leadership establishes clear expectations to all personnel to comply with internal and external safety and health requirements. Furthermore, our HES values are embedded within our culture and the support we provide to our employees. We provide and require job specific HES training for our employees and safety-sensitive contractors as part of our Responsible Operations Management Systems ( ROMS ), which is a comprehensive operations integrity management system. This training includes stop the job authority extended to all employees and contractors in the event of a potential safety risk or environmental impact. We leverage our collective talent and seek diverse employee perspectives to address complex issues and events through the use of multi-functional teams and committees, such as our internal Centralized Emergency Response Team ( CERT ) and Emissions Management Committee (EMC). The EMC prioritizes GHG and methane emissions reduction opportunities across our enterprise and is responsible for ensuring appropriate funding is in place as part of our overall capital allocation process. Our commitment to addressing the dual challenge of meeting the world growing energy demands while also taking action on climate change is evidenced by GHG intensity featuring prominently as a metric linked directly to compensation outcomes. Our values to collaborate, take ownership, be bold and deliver results enable us to excel, but that only possible if our workforce is safe. We actively look out for each other, maintain a safe work environment, continuously improve our procedures and train our workforce. Marathon Oil utilizes ROMS to manage risk and strives for a safe, healthy and secure workplace where all those involved can work free of injury and illness. Our Total Recordable Injury Rate ( TRIR ) is just one of the metrics we use to measure our success in providing a safe working environment and is linked directly to compensation outcomes. Marathon strives to only partner with contractors who share our same commitment to safety and environmental impact. We carefully evaluate contractors through a rigorous supply chain process to verify they possess all necessary safety and health programs to execute work in a manner that meets our expectations. Benefits We attract and retain talent by offering benefit programs that are competitive and comprehensive. These programs create flexibility that allows employees to develop a meaningful career and overall well-being for themselves and their families. In August 2022, we made the commitment to fund employee premiums for health plans through 2023 to help support them through ongoing inflationary pressures. Our goal is to support employees with benefit programs that are consistent with our company's vision and strategies. We align the value of the benefit programs to the local markets where we compete for talent, along with the broader oil and gas industry. We believe effective communication around our benefit programs helps ensure we understand employees' perceptions and values around our benefits and that our employees understand the breadth and value of the benefits provided. Compensation Our success is based on financial performance and operational results, and we believe that our compensation program is an important driver of that success. The primary objectives of our programs are to pay for performance, encourage long-term stockholder value and pay competitively. To accomplish this, our compensation program is designed to reward employees for their performance and motivate them to continue to perform at a high level through both absolute feedback and relative performance assessment. The annual cash bonus is our short-term incentive for eligible employees, which reinforces both corporate and individual annual performance and prioritizes both financial and operational metrics. In 2022, in addition to the annual cash bonus, we provided a one-time cash payment to all eligible full-time employees to recognize and reward their invaluable contribution to our operational and financial success, which included significantly exceeding our commitment to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends paid. Eligible employees may also receive long-term incentives in the form of restricted stock awards that vest over multiple years to support retention and aligns employee interests with those of our stockholders, by driving value at the enterprise level. We provide market-competitive pay levels to attract and retain the best talent. We regularly benchmark each component of our pay program, including our benefit programs against our peers and a broader subset of the oil and gas industry, to ensure we remain competitive. See the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of our Annual Proxy for information on our Executive Officers. 18 Table of Content s Talent Development We invest in talent processes that drive high performance. We take a multi-pronged approach to organizational learning, which is driven through our centralized on-demand development hub and informed by our enterprise-wide talent assessment process. Our organizational learning approach blends online, on-the-job and classroom training with 360 assessments and leadership coaching to ensure all employees receive the feedback, tools and time they need to reach their fullest potential. Continuous leadership development is offered to all leaders throughout the year and content is intentionally focused on learning objectives. These programs range from new manager trainings to executive-level business simulations. We review talent across the enterprise, measuring both technical and leadership capabilities. We leverage these talent assessments to identify critical skill gaps, guide critical skills training and ensure the effective deployment of talent. Our talent planning processes are aligned and consistent across the organization to ensure top talent occupies our most critical roles. Our succession process is designed to ensure we have identified the experiences and exposures needed to prepare employees for success in future senior leadership roles. We utilize an employee mentoring program, which focuses on increasing communication, connection and trust to advance our company culture. We also continued our Board mentoring program, which pairs senior leaders with directors.

Risk Factors We are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. The following summarizes significant risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. When considering an investment in our securities, you should carefully consider the risk factors included below as well as those matters referenced in the foregoing pages under Disclosures Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and other information included and incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Risks Associated with Our Industry A substantial decline in crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas prices would reduce our operating results and cash flows and could adversely impact the carrying value of our assets. The markets for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future, causing prices to fluctuate widely. Our revenues and operating results are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas. Many of the factors influencing prices of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas are beyond our control. These factors include: worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas; the cost of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas; the ability of the members of OPEC+ to agree to and maintain production controls; the production levels of non-OPEC countries, including production levels in the shale plays in the United States; the level of drilling, completion and production activities by other exploration and production companies, and variability therein, in response to market conditions; political instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions, such as the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine; changes in weather patterns and climate; natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes; the price and availability of alternative and competing forms of energy, such as nuclear, hydroelectric, wind and solar; the effect of conservation efforts; epidemics or pandemics, including COVID-19; technological advances affecting energy consumption and energy supply; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and general economic conditions worldwide. The long-term effects of these and other factors on the prices of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas are uncertain. Historical declines in commodity prices have adversely affected our business by: reducing the amount of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas that we can produce economically; reducing our revenues, operating income and cash flows; causing us to reduce our capital expenditures, and delay or postpone some of our capital projects; requiring us to impair the carrying value of our assets; reducing the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas; and increasing the costs of obtaining capital, such as equity and short- and long-term debt. 21 Table of Content s Estimates of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas reserves depend on many factors and assumptions, including various assumptions that are based on conditions in existence as of the dates of the estimates. Any material changes in those conditions or other factors affecting those assumptions could impair the quantity and value of our reserves. The proved reserve information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been derived from engineering and geoscience estimates. Estimates of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas were prepared, in accordance with SEC regulations, by teams of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals and were reviewed and approved by our Corporate Reserves Group. Reserves were valued based on SEC pricing for the periods ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, as well as other conditions in existence at those dates. The table below provides the 2022 SEC pricing for certain benchmark prices: 2022 SEC Pricing WTI crude oil (per bbl) $ 93.67 Henry Hub natural gas (per mmbtu) $ 6.36 Brent crude oil (per bbl) $ 100.25 Mont Belvieu NGLs (per bbl) $ 36.59 If commodity prices in the future average below prices used to determine proved reserves at December 31, 2022, it could have an adverse effect on our estimates of proved reserve volumes and the value of our business. Future reserve revisions could also result from changes in capital funding, drilling plans and governmental regulation, among other things. Reserve estimation is a subjective process that involves estimating volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas that cannot be directly measured. Estimates of economically producible reserves and of future net cash flows depend on a number of variable factors and assumptions, including: location, size and shape of the accumulation, as well as fluid, rock and producing characteristics of the accumulation; historical production from the area, compared with production from other analogous producing areas; the assumed impacts of regulation by governmental agencies; assumptions concerning operating costs, taxes, development costs and workover and repair costs; and industry economic conditions, levels of cash flows from operations and other operating considerations. As a result, different petroleum engineers and geoscientists, each using industry-accepted geologic and engineering practices and scientific methods, may produce different estimates of proved reserves and future net cash flows based on the same available data. Because of the subjective nature of such reserve estimates, each of the following items may differ materially from the estimated amounts: the amount and timing of production; the revenues and costs associated with that production; and the amount and timing of future development expenditures. Our operations may be adversely affected by pipeline, rail and other transportation capacity constraints. The marketability of our production depends in part on the availability, proximity and capacity of gathering and transportation pipeline facilities, rail cars, trucks and vessels. These facilities and equipment may be temporarily unavailable to us due to market conditions, regulatory reasons, mechanical reasons or other factors or conditions, and may not be available to us in the future on terms we consider acceptable, if at all. If any pipelines, rail cars, trucks or vessels become unavailable, we would, to the extent possible, be required to find a suitable alternative to transport our crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, which could increase the costs and/or reduce the revenues we might obtain from the sale of our production. A pipeline shutdown could also have an impact on safety because it would require the use of additional trucks, rail cars and personnel. In addition, both the cost and availability of pipelines, rail cars, trucks or vessels to transport our production could be adversely impacted by new state or federal regulations relating to transportation of crude oil. Any significant change in market, regulatory or other conditions affecting our access to, or the availability of, these facilities and equipment, including due to our failure or inability to obtain access to these facilities and equipment on terms acceptable to us or at all, could materially and adversely affect our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations. 22 Table of Content s If we acquire crude oil and natural gas properties, our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems, including title problems, to accurately estimate reserves, production rates or costs, or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We typically seek the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas properties and leases. For example, in December 2022, we completed the acquisition of the Eagle Ford assets of Ensign Natural Resources for total cash consideration of $3.0 billion. Although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is diligent and consistent with industry practices, reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, including title problems, nor may they permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to fully assess possible deficiencies and potential problems. Properties and leases that we acquire may be subject to prior unregistered agreements, or transfers which have not been recorded or detected through our due diligence searches. If title to property associated with our projects is challenged, we may have to expend funds defending any such claims and our ownership interest therein may be detrimentally affected if we lose. Even when problems with a property are identified, we often assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements. Moreover, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas (as previously discussed), actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties. Actual reserves, production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates. In addition, an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations, particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations. Our operations may be affected by Native American treaty, title and other rights or claims. We are, and may in the future become, subject to various laws and regulations that apply to operators and other parties operating within the boundaries of Native American reservations in the United States. These laws and regulations may result in the imposition of certain fees, taxes, environmental standards, lease conditions or requirements to employ specified contractors or service providers. Any one of these requirements, or any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, the approvals or permits necessary to operate within the boundaries of Native American tribal lands, could adversely impact the Company operations and ability to explore and develop new and existing properties. Additionally, from time to time, disputes may arise between state or federal governments and Native American tribes regarding title to lands within the United States or questions of sovereignty between the states and Native American tribes. For example, the State of North Dakota and three Indian tribes (the Three Affiliated Tribes ) represented by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, have been involved in a dispute regarding the ownership of certain lands underlying the Missouri River and Little Missouri River (the Disputed Land ) from which we currently produce. The United States Department of the Interior ( DOI ) has addressed the United States position with respect to this dispute several times over the past five years with conflicting opinions. Most recently, on February 4, 2022, the DOI issued an opinion ( M-Opinion ) concluding the DOI position that the Disputed Land is held in trust for the Three Affiliated Tribes. While the M-Opinion is binding on all agencies within the DOI, it is not legally binding on third parties, including Marathon Oil, or a court. Depending on the ultimate outcome of this title dispute, the Three Affiliated Tribes could challenge the validity of certain of our leases relating to a portion of the disputed land, and if such challenge were successful it could result in operational delays and additional costs, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, the process of addressing such claim or dispute, regardless of the outcome, could be expensive and time consuming and could result in delays which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Future exploration and drilling results are uncertain and involve substantial costs. Drilling for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive reservoirs. The costs of drilling, completing and operating wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including: unexpected drilling conditions; title problems; pressure or irregularities in formations; equipment failures or accidents; inflation in exploration and drilling costs; fires, explosions, blowouts or surface cratering; lack of, or disruption in, access to pipelines or other transportation methods; and shortages or delays in the availability of services or delivery of equipment. 23 Table of Content s We operate in a highly competitive industry, and many of our competitors are larger and have available resources in excess of our own. The oil and gas industry is highly competitive, and many competitors, including major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, are larger and have substantially greater resources at their disposal than we do. We compete with these companies for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. We also compete with these companies for equipment and personnel, including petroleum engineers, geologists, geophysicists and other specialists, required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas to end-users. Such competition can significantly increase costs and affect the availability of resources, which could provide our larger competitors a competitive advantage when acquiring equipment, leases and other properties. They may also be able to use their greater resources to attract and retain experienced personnel. We are subject to various climate-related risks, including risks related to the transition to a lower-carbon economy and physical risks resulting from climate change. The following is a summary of potential climate-related risks that could adversely affect us: Policy and Legal Risks . Policy risks include actions that seek to lessen activities that contribute to adverse effects of climate change or to promote adaptation to climate change, such as the enactment of climate change-related regulations, policies and initiatives addressing alternative energy requirements, new fuel consumption standards, energy conservation and emissions reductions measures or responsible energy development, among other measures. Policy actions also may include restrictions or bans on oil and gas activities, like the January 2021 Presidential and Secretarial orders, and the potential banning of hydraulic fracturing, which could lead to write-downs or impairments of our assets. Legal risks include potential lawsuits claiming, among other things, failure to mitigate impacts of climate change, failure to adapt to climate change and the insufficiency of disclosure around material financial risks. For instance, government entities and other groups have filed lawsuits in several states seeking to hold a wide variety of companies that produce fossil fuels liable for the alleged impacts of the greenhouse gas emissions and other alleged harm attributable to those fuels. The lawsuits allege damages as a result of global warming and the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and abatement under various theories. Marathon Oil has been named as a defendant in several of these lawsuits, along with numerous other companies. The increasing attention to global climate change risks has created the potential for a greater likelihood of governmental investigations and private and public litigation, which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business. Market Risks . Markets could be affected by climate change through shifts in supply and demand for certain commodities, including oil and gas and other products dependent on oil and gas. Lower demand for our oil and gas production, or lower demand for products that use oil and gas as fuel sources or increased demand for lower-emission or more efficient products and services, could result in lower prices and lower revenues. Market risk also may take the form of limited access to capital as investors shift investments to industries and alternative energy industries that may be, or be perceived to be, less carbon-intensive. In addition, certain investment advisers, banks and sovereign wealth, pension and endowment funds recently have been promoting divestment of investments in fossil fuel companies and pressuring lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction, production and sale of oil and gas. Some banks and asset managers have made climate-related pledges for various initiatives, such as stopping the financing of Arctic drilling and coal companies. These initiatives by activists and banks could interfere with our business activities, operations and ability to access capital. Institutional lenders who provide financing to energy companies such as ours have also become more attentive to sustainable lending practices, and some may elect not to provide traditional energy producers or companies that support such producers with funding. Technology Risks . Technological improvements or innovations that support the transition to a lower-carbon economic system may have a significant impact on us. The development and use of emerging technologies in renewable energy, battery storage, and energy efficiency may lower demand for oil and gas, resulting in lower prices and revenues. In addition, many automobile manufacturers have announced plans to shift production from internal combustion engine to electric powered vehicles, and some states and foreign countries have announced bans on sales of internal combustion engine vehicles beginning as early as 2025, which would reduce demand for oil. Reputation Risk . Climate change is a potential source of reputational risk, which is tied to changing customer or community perceptions of an organization contribution to, or detraction from, the transition to a lower-carbon economy. These changing perceptions could lower demand for our oil and gas production, resulting in lower prices and lower revenues as consumers avoid carbon-intensive industries, and could also pressure banks and investment managers to shift investments and reduce lending as described above. 24 Table of Content s Physical Risks . Potential physical risks resulting from climate change may be event driven (including increased severity of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, winter storms, droughts or floods) or longer-term shifts in climate patterns that may cause sea level rise or chronic heat waves. Potential physical risks may cause direct damage to assets and indirect impacts such as supply or distribution chain disruption and also could include changes in water or other raw material availability, sourcing, pricing and quality, which could impact drilling and completions operations. These physical risks could adversely affect or delay demand for oil or natural gas, cause increased costs, production disruptions and lower revenues and substantially increase the cost or limit the availability of insurance. Our offshore operations in E.G. involve special risks that could negatively impact us. Offshore operations present technological challenges and operating risks because of the marine environment. Activities in offshore operations may pose risks because of the physical distance to oilfield service infrastructure and service providers. Environmental remediation and other costs resulting from spills or releases may result in substantial liabilities. Risks Related to Our Business Model and Capital Structure If we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional reserves, our future crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas production would decline, thereby reducing our cash flows and results of operations and impairing our financial condition. The rate of production from crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas properties generally decline as reserves are depleted. Except to the extent we acquire interests in additional properties containing proved reserves, conduct successful exploration and development activities, or, through engineering studies, optimize production performance or identify additional reservoirs not currently producing or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves may decline materially as crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas are produced. Accordingly, to the extent we are not successful in replacing the crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas we produce, our future revenues may decline. Creating and maintaining an inventory of prospects for future production depends on many factors, including: obtaining rights to explore for, develop and produce crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas in promising areas; drilling success; the ability to complete projects timely and cost effectively; the ability to find or acquire additional proved reserves at acceptable costs; and the ability to fund such activity. If crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas prices decrease, it could adversely affect the abilities of our counterparties or joint venture partners to perform their obligations to us, which could negatively impact our financial results. We often enter into arrangements to conduct certain business operations, such as oil and gas exploration and production, or transportation of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, with partners, co-working interest owners and other counterparties in order to share risks associated with those operations. In addition, we market our products to a variety of purchasers. If commodity prices decrease, some of our counterparties may experience liquidity problems and may not be able to meet their financial and other obligations to us. The inability of our joint venture partners or co-working interest owners to fund their portion of the costs under our joint venture agreements and joint operating agreements, or the nonperformance by purchasers, contractors or other counterparties of their obligations to us, could negatively impact our operating results and cash flows. If we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs and in a timely manner, or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving drilling and completion activities, engineering, procurement and construction of facilities (including improvements and repairs to our existing facilities) could adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results. Delays in making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to supply certain products we produce. Such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: denial of or delay in receiving requisite regulatory approvals and/or permits; unplanned increases in the cost of construction materials or labor; disruptions in transportation of components or construction materials; increased costs or operational delays resulting from shortages of water; 25 Table of Content s adverse weather conditions, natural disasters or other events (such as equipment malfunctions, explosions, fires or spills) affecting our facilities, or those of vendors or suppliers; shortages of sufficiently skilled labor, or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages; market-related increases in a project debt or equity financing costs; and nonperformance by, or disputes with, vendors, suppliers, contractors or subcontractors. Any one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our capital projects. Our level of indebtedness may limit our liquidity and financial flexibility. As of December 31, 2022, our total debt was $5.9 billion, of which $402 million is due within the next year. Our indebtedness could have important consequences to our business, including, but not limited to, the following: we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions; a portion of our cash flows from operating activities must be used to service our indebtedness and is not available for other purposes; our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our industry may be limited; a financial covenant in our unsecured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility ) stipulates that our total debt to total capitalization ratio will not exceed 65% as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, and if exceeded, may make additional borrowings more expensive and affect our ability to plan for and react to changes in the economy and our industry; we may be at a competitive disadvantage as compared to similar companies that have less debt; and additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or development activities, general corporate or other purposes may have higher costs and more restrictive covenants. We may incur additional debt in order to fund our capital expenditures, acquisitions or development activities, or for general corporate or other purposes. A higher level of indebtedness increases the risk that our financial flexibility may deteriorate. Our ability to meet our debt obligations and service our debt depends on future performance. General economic conditions, crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas prices, inflation, interest rates and financial, business and other factors will affect our operations and our future performance. Many of these factors are beyond our control and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the principal and interest on our debt, and future working capital, borrowings and equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of debt obligations. Difficulty in accessing capital or a significant increase in our costs of accessing capital could adversely affect our business. A downgrade of our credit ratings or other influences, including third-party groups promoting the divestment of fossil fuel equities or pressuring financial services companies to limit or curtail activities with fossil fuel companies, could negatively impact our cost of capital and our ability to access the capital markets, increase the interest rate and fees we pay on our Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility, and may limit or reduce credit lines with our bank counterparties. We receive credit ratings on our debt obligations from the major credit rating agencies in the United States. Due to the volatility in worldwide crude oil, NGL and natural gas prices in recent years, credit rating agencies review companies in the energy industry periodically, including us. At December 31, 2022, our corporate credit ratings were: Standard & Poor Global Ratings Services BBB- (stable); Fitch Ratings BBB- (positive); and Moody Investor Services, Inc. Baa3 (stable). Each credit rating should be evaluated independently and is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and may be subject to revision or withdrawal by the assigning rating organization from time to time. The credit rating process is contingent upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. We could also be required to post letters of credit or other forms of collateral for certain contractual obligations, which could increase our costs and decrease our liquidity or letter of credit capacity under our Credit Facility. Limitations on our ability to access capital could adversely impact the level of our capital spending budget, our ability to manage our debt maturities, or our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. Our commodity price risk management activities may prevent us from fully benefiting from commodity price increases and may expose us to other risks, including counterparty risk. Global commodity prices are volatile. In order to mitigate commodity price volatility and increase the predictability of cash flows related to the marketing of our crude oil, NGLs and natural gas, we, from time to time, enter into crude oil, NGL and natural gas hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production. While hedging arrangements are intended to mitigate commodity price volatility, we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of price increases above the price levels of the derivative instruments used to manage price risk. In addition, our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to perform under the contracts. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk . 26 Table of Content s Some of our major projects and operations are conducted jointly with other parties, which may decrease our ability to manage risk. We often enter into arrangements to conduct certain business operations, such as oil and gas exploration and production with other parties in order to share risks associated with those operations. However, these arrangements also may decrease our ability to manage risks and costs, particularly where we are not the operator. We could have limited influence over and control of the behaviors and performance of these operations. In addition, misconduct, fraud, bankruptcy, noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations or improper activities by or on behalf of one or more of our partners or co-working interest owners, or entities we have entered into arrangements with could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. The declaration and payment of dividends, and repurchases of our common stock, are each within the discretion of our Board of Directors and subject to certain considerations and limitations. The payment of future dividends on, and any repurchases of, our common stock are each subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors, which considers, among other factors: cash available; our results of operations and anticipated future results of operations; our financial condition, including liquidity, leverage and anticipated future capital expenditures required to conduct our operations; our operating expenses; general business and market conditions; and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant. We expect to continue to pay dividends to our stockholders; however, our Board of Directors may reduce our dividend or cease declaring dividends at any time, including if it determines that our current or forecasted future cash flows provided by our operating activities (after deducting our capital expenditures and other commitments) are not sufficient to pay our desired levels of dividends to our stockholders or to pay dividends to our stockholders at all. Effective November 2, 2022, our Board of Directors increased our remaining share repurchase program authorization to $2.5 billion, however, this program may be suspended, modified, or discontinued by the Board of Directors at any time. We can provide no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends or repurchase common stock at the current rate or at all. Any downward revision in the amount of dividends we pay to stockholders, or reduction in the pace of share repurchases, could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Regulatory Compliance and International Operations Risks We may incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs, and our production could be adversely affected, as a result of compliance with and changes in law, regulations or requirements or initiatives, including those addressing environmental, health, safety or security or the impact of global climate change, air emissions or water management, and, as a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Our businesses are currently subject to numerous laws, regulations, executive orders and other requirements relating to the protection of the environment, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment such as the flaring of natural gas, waste management, pollution prevention, greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane, prevention of seismicity and the protection of endangered species as well as laws, regulations and other requirements relating to public and employee safety and health and to facility security. The current administration issued a number of executive and temporary orders that address broad ranging issues including climate change, oil and gas activities on federal lands, infrastructure and environmental justice. These actions have been followed by a number of related regulatory proposals that are in various stages of the rulemaking process. Amendments or extensions along with implementation of the announced policy positions and initiatives that flow from these orders may have a material adverse impact on our business. 27 Table of Content s Additionally, states in which we operate are considering proposals to address climate change or increase regulations of the oil and gas industry or impose additional regulations based on questions of sovereignty between the states and Native American tribes. We have incurred and may continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws, regulations and other requirements or initiatives that are being considered or otherwise implemented. To the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products, our operating results could be adversely affected. The specific impact of these laws, regulations and other requirements may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of operating facilities and production processes. We may also be required to make material expenditures to modify operations, install pollution control equipment, perform site clean-ups or curtail operations that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may become subject to liabilities that we currently do not anticipate in connection with new, amended or more stringent requirements, stricter interpretations of existing requirements or the future discovery of contamination. In addition, any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws, regulations and other requirements could result in civil penalties or criminal fines and other enforcement actions against us. For example, we have received Notices of Violation from the EPA related to allegations of violations of the Clean Air Act relating to our operations on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation between 2015 and 2019. We are actively negotiating a draft consent decree with the EPA and Department of Justice containing certain proposed injunctive terms relating to this enforcement action. The enforcement action will likely include monetary sanctions and implementation of both environmental mitigation projects and injunctive terms, which would increase both our development costs and operating costs. Through the date of this filing, there exists substantial uncertainty as to the ultimate result of this matter and it is reasonably possible the result could be materially different from our accrual. The Biden administration has already taken steps to address climate change, and we expect actions like these to continue, including additional orders, laws or regulations that could affect our operations. Our operations result in greenhouse gas emissions. Currently, various legislative or regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides) are in various phases of review, discussion or implementation in the U.S. Internationally, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change finalized an agreement among 195 nations at the 21st Conference of the Parties in Paris with an overarching goal of preventing global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius (the Paris Agreement ). The Paris Agreement requires signatory countries to set voluntary targets to reduce domestic greenhouse gas emissions. In November 2020, the U.S. withdrew from the Paris Agreement. However, in February 2021, President Biden recommitted the U.S. to the Paris Agreement along with a new nationally determined contribution for U.S. GHG emissions that would achieve emissions reductions of at least 50% relative to 2005 levels by 2030. In addition, in September 2021, President Biden publicly announced the Global Methane Pledge, a pact that aims to reduce global methane emissions at least 30% below 2020 levels by 2030. Since its formal launch at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ), over 100 countries have joined the pledge. Most recently, at the 27th Conference of Parties ( COP27 ), President Biden announced the EPA proposed standards to reduce methane emissions from existing oil and gas sources and agreed, in conjunction with the European Union and a number of other partner countries, to develop standards for monitoring and reporting methane emissions to help create a market for low methane-intensity natural gas. Various state and local governments have also publicly committed to furthering the goals of the Paris Agreement. In addition, the $1 trillion legislative infrastructure package passed by Congress in November 2021 includes a number of climate-focused spending initiatives aimed at climate resilience, enhanced response and preparation for extreme weather events and clean energy and transportation investments. The IRA also provides significant funding and incentives for research and development of low-carbon energy production methods, carbon capture and other programs directed at addressing climate change. In addition, a number of U.S. state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions by means of carbon taxes, policies and incentives to encourage the use of renewable energy or alternative low-carbon fuels, and cap and trade programs that typically require major sources of GHG emissions, such as electric power plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. Furthermore, many state and local leaders have intensified or stated their intent to intensify efforts to support international climate commitments and treaties. New legislation, regulations or international agreements in the future could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities, capital expenditures to install new emission controls at our facilities and costs to administer and manage any potential greenhouse gas emissions or carbon trading or tax programs. These costs and capital expenditures could be material. Although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs, reduce the demand for crude oil and condensate, NGLs, and natural gas and create delays in our obtaining air pollution permits for new or modified facilities. Additionally, on March 21, 2022, the SEC issued a proposed rule regarding the enhancement and standardization of mandatory climate-related disclosures. The proposed rule would require registrants to include certain climate-related disclosures in their registration statements and periodic reports. Although the proposed rule ultimate date of effectiveness and the final form and substance of these requirements is not yet known and the ultimate scope and impact on our business is uncertain, compliance with the proposed rule, if finalized, may result in increased legal, accounting, operational, technology and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly and place strain on our personnel, systems and resources. 28 Table of Content s The potential adoption of federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased compliance costs, operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and gas wells. Hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injecting water, sand and small volumes of chemicals into the wellbore to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock thousands of feet below the surface to facilitate higher flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. Our business uses this technique extensively throughout our U.S. operations. Hydraulic fracturing has been regulated at the state and local level through permitting and compliance requirements. Various state and local-level initiatives in regions with substantial shale resources have been or may be proposed or implemented to further regulate hydraulic fracturing practices, limit water withdrawals and water use, require disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents, restrict which additives may be used, or implement temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing. Increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, including from the shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs which could increase costs of our operations and cause considerable delays in acquiring regulatory approvals to drill and complete wells. The potential adoption of federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives intended to address potential induced seismic activity in the areas in which we operate could result in increased compliance costs, operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and gas wells. The production of oil and gas inherently involves the generation of produced water and oil and gas waste. State and federal regulatory agencies have focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and gas waste disposal and seismic activity. Separate and apart from the referenced potential connection between injection wells and seismicity, concerns have been raised that hydraulic fracturing activities may be correlated to anomalous seismic events. When caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. Marathon operates produced water injection wells and contracts for disposal of oil and gas waste in injection wells operated by third parties. Additionally, Marathon uses hydraulic fracturing techniques throughout its U.S. operations. The legal requirements related to the disposal of produced water by means of underground injection wells are subject to change based on concerns of the public or governmental authorities regarding such disposal activities. One such concern arises from recent seismic events near injection disposal wells that are used for the disposal by injection of produced water resulting from oil and natural gas activities. In 2016, the United States Geological Survey identified New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas as being among the states with areas of increased rates of induced seismicity that could be attributed to fluid injection or oil and natural gas extraction. In response to concerns regarding induced seismicity, regulators in some states have imposed, or are considering imposing, additional requirements in the permitting and operating of produced water disposal wells. For example, in Texas, the Railroad Commission adopted rules in 2014 governing the permitting or re-permitting of wells used to dispose of produced water and other fluids resulting from the production of oil and natural gas in order to address induced seismicity concerns within the state. Among other things, these rules require companies seeking permits for disposal wells to provide seismic activity data in permit applications, provide for more frequent monitoring and reporting for certain wells and allow the state to modify, suspend or terminate permits on grounds that a disposal well is likely to be, or determined to be, causing seismic activity. Another example includes the recent Seismic Event Mitigation Plan and Protocol announced by the New Mexico Oil Conservation Division in 2021, which requires monitoring and the potential curtailments or shut-ins of salt water disposal wells located within specified distances of certain seismic events. States may issue new orders or implement policies to temporarily shut down or to curtail the injection volumes of existing wells in the vicinity of seismic events. Legislative, regulatory and policy initiatives intended to address these concerns may result in additional levels of regulation or other requirements that could lead to operational delays, increase our operating and compliance costs or otherwise adversely affect our operations. Another consequence of seismic events may be lawsuits alleging that disposal well operations have caused damage to properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal. These developments could result in additional regulation and restrictions on the use of injection wells by us or by third parties with whom we may contract to dispose of produced water. Increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity could also lead to greater opposition, including litigation to limit or prohibit oil and natural gas activities utilizing injection wells for produced water disposal. Any one or more of these developments may result in operational delays, increase our operating and compliance costs or otherwise adversely affect our operations. 29 Table of Content s Political and economic developments, possible terrorist activities and changes in law or policy in the U.S. or global markets could adversely affect our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows. Local political and economic factors in U.S. and global markets could have a material adverse effect on us. We are subject to the political, geographic and economic risks and possible terrorist or piracy activities or other armed conflict attendant to doing business within or outside of the U.S. There are also many risks associated with operations in E.G. including the possibility that the government may seize our property with or without compensation, may attempt to renegotiate or revoke existing contractual arrangements or may impose additional taxes or royalty burdens. Changes in the U.S. or global political and economic environment or any U.S. or global hostility or the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks, or other armed conflict, could adversely affect the economies of the U.S. and other developed countries. A lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects. These risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas. In addition, these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate. These risks could also cause damage to, or the inability to access, production facilities or other operating assets and could limit our service and equipment providers ability to deliver items necessary for us to conduct our operations. Actions of governments through tax legislation or interpretations of tax law, and other changes in law, executive order and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability, both in the U.S. and abroad. The U.S. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries. These restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate in, or gain access to, opportunities in various countries and will continue to do so in the future. Changes in U.S. or foreign laws could also adversely affect our results, including new regulations resulting in higher costs to comply with regulations and higher costs to transport our production by pipeline, rail car, truck or vessel or the adoption of government payment transparency regulations that could require us to disclose competitively sensitive commercial information or that could cause us to violate the non-disclosure laws of other countries. General Risks Our sector and the broader U.S. economy experienced higher than expected inflationary pressures in 2022 related to continued supply chain disruptions, labor shortages and geopolitical instability. Should these conditions persist, it may impact our ability to procure materials and equipment on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and, as a result, our business, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Throughout 2022, we experienced significant increases in the costs of certain materials, including steel, sand and fuel, as a result of availability constraints, supply chain disruption, increased demand, labor shortages associated with a fully employed US labor force, inflation and other factors. Though we incorporated inflationary factors into our 2022 business plan, inflation outpaced those original assumptions and, while we have incorporated inflationary factors into our 2023 business plan, inflation may outpace those assumptions. These challenges are due in large measure to increased demand for oil and gas production driven by the continued economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and more broadly, systemic underinvestment in global oil and gas development. These supply and demand fundamentals have been further aggravated by disruptions in global energy supply caused by multiple geopolitical events, including the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. We continue to undertake actions and implement plans to strengthen our supply chain to address these pressures and protect the requisite access to commodities and services. Nevertheless, we expect for the foreseeable future to experience supply chain constraints and may continue to experience inflationary pressure on our cost structure. These supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures may continue to adversely impact our cost of operations and if we are unable to manage our global supply chain, it may impact our ability to procure materials and equipment in a timely and cost-effective manner, if at all, which could result in reduced margins and production delays and, as a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Changes in U.S. and international tax rules and regulations, or interpretations thereof, may materially and adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. 30 Table of Content s We are subject to income- and non-income-based taxes in the United States under federal, state, and local jurisdictions and in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws, regulations and administrative practices in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without advance notice, due to economic, political and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. Our tax liabilities could be affected by numerous factors, such as changes in tax, accounting and other laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles and interpretations, the mix and level of earnings in a given taxing jurisdiction or our ownership or capital structure. For example, on August 16, 2022, the United States enacted the IRA, which is highly complex, subject to interpretation, and contains significant changes to U.S. tax law including, but not limited to, a 15% corporate book minimum tax and a 1% excise tax on stock repurchases. The U.S. Department of the Treasury and the IRS are expected to release further regulations and interpretive guidance implementing the legislation contained in the IRA, but the details and timing of such regulations are subject to uncertainty at this time. The tax provisions of the IRA which may apply to us are generally effective in 2023 or later and therefore tax impacts to us in 2022 were immaterial. However, it is possible that the enactment of changes in the U.S. corporate tax system, including in connection with the IRA, could have a material effect on our consolidated cash taxes in the future. Outbreaks of communicable diseases, such as COVID-19, have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Global or national health concerns, including a widespread outbreak of contagious disease, can, among other impacts, negatively impact the global economy, reduce demand and pricing for crude oil, NGLs and natural gas, lead to operational disruptions and limit our ability to execute on our business plan, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, uncertainty regarding the impact of any outbreak of contagious disease could lead to increased volatility in crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices. For example, the novel coronavirus global pandemic, known as COVID-19, had a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations in 2020. The early effects of COVID-19 included a substantial decline in demand for crude oil, condensate, NGLs, natural gas and other petroleum hydrocarbons, along with a corresponding deterioration in prices. While demand for crude oil, condensate, NGLs, natural gas and other petroleum hydrocarbons significantly recovered as the COVID-19 pandemic evolved, we are unable to predict the future impact of COVID-19 (including the emergence, contagiousness and threat of new and different strains), or a widespread outbreak of another contagious disease, on overall economic activity and the demand for, and pricing of, our products. COVID-19, or a widespread outbreak of another contagious disease, could have a negative impact on our operations; impact the ability of our counterparties to perform their obligations; result in voluntary and involuntary curtailments, delays or cancellations of certain drilling activities; impair the quantity or value of our reserves; result in transportation and storage capacity constraints; cause shortages of key personnel, including employees, contractors and subcontractors; interrupt global supply chains; increase impairments and associated charges to our earnings; impact our cash on hand, uses of cash and cause a decrease to our financial flexibility and liquidity. In addition, the risks associated with COVID-19 impacted, and COVID-19, or a widespread outbreak of another contagious disease, may in the future impact our workforce and the way we meet our business objectives, and such impact may be material. The extent to which the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic will impact our business and our financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Our business could be negatively impacted by cyberattacks targeting our computer and telecommunications systems and infrastructure or targeting those of our third-party service providers. Our business, like other companies in the oil and gas industry, has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies, including technologies that are managed by third-party service providers or other providers of goods or services to our industry on whom we directly or indirectly rely to help us collect, host or process information. Such technologies are integrated into our business operations and used as a part of our production and distribution systems in the U.S. and abroad, including those systems used to transport production to market, to enable communications and to provide a host of other support services for our business. Accordingly, our use of the internet and other public networks for communications, services and storage, including cloud computing, exposes us and our users to cybersecurity risks. 31 Table of Content s There is no guarantee that our security measures will provide absolute security. We may not be able to anticipate, detect or prevent cyberattacks, particularly because the methodologies used by attackers change frequently or may not be recognized until launched, and because attackers are increasingly using techniques designed to circumvent controls and avoid detection. We and our third-party service providers may therefore be vulnerable to security events that are beyond our control, and we may be the target of cyber-attacks, as well as physical attacks, which could result in the unauthorized access to our information systems or data, the data of our customers and our employees or significant disruption to our business. These attacks could adversely impact our business operations, our revenue and profits, our ability to comply with legal, contractual and regulatory requirements, our reputation and goodwill, as well as result in legal risk, enforcement actions and litigation. Our information systems and related infrastructure have experienced attempted and actual instances of unauthorized access in the past, but we have not suffered any losses or breaches which had a material effect on our business, operations or reputation relating to such attacks; however, there is no assurance that we will not suffer such losses or breaches in the future. As cyberattacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to respond to cyberattacks, to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures, or to investigate and remediate any information systems and related infrastructure security vulnerabilities. Additionally, the continuing and evolving threat of cybersecurity attacks has resulted in evolving legal and compliance matters, including increased regulatory focus on prevention, which could require us to expend significant additional resources to meet such requirements. We may also be subject to regulatory investigations or litigation relating from cybersecurity issues. Our business may be materially adversely affected by negative publicity. From time to time, political and public sentiment with respect to, or impacts by, the oil and gas industry may result in adverse press coverage and other adverse public statements affecting our business. Additionally, though we believe we can achieve our voluntary company targets and goals, any failure to realize or perception of failure to realize voluntary targets or long-term goals, including GHG emissions targets and other environmental objectives, could lead to adverse press coverage and other adverse public statements affecting Marathon Oil. Adverse press coverage and other adverse statements, whether or not driven by political or public sentiment, may also result in investigations by regulators, legislators and law enforcement officials or in legal claims. Our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses. We do not insure against all potential losses and therefore we could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities and increased costs. Our United States and International operations are subject to unplanned occurrences, including blowouts, explosions, fires, loss of well control, spills, tornadoes, hurricanes and other adverse weather, tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or nuclear or other disasters, labor disputes and accidents. These same risks can be applied to the third parties that transport our products from our facilities. A prolonged disruption in the ability of any pipelines, rail cars, trucks or vessels to transport our production could contribute to a business interruption or increase costs. Our operations are also subject to the additional hazards of pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks. These hazards could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property and equipment, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses to us. Various hazards have adversely affected us in the past, and damages resulting from a catastrophic occurrence in the future involving us or any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially large claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities. We maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from operating hazards in amounts that we believe to be prudent. Uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating hazards could reduce the funds available to us for capital, exploration and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Historically, we have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage including at times resulting business interruption to our major onshore and offshore facilities, with significant self-insured retentions. In the future, we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for our insurance policies will change over time and could escalate. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. Litigation by private plaintiffs or government officials or entities could adversely affect our performance. We currently are defending litigation and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation in the future. The subject matter of such litigation may include releases of hazardous substances from our facilities, privacy laws, contract disputes, title disputes, royalty disputes or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations. In some cases the plaintiff or plaintiffs seek alleged damages involving large classes of potential litigants and may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances. If we are not able to successfully defend such claims, they may result in substantial liability. We do not have insurance covering all of these potential liabilities. In addition to substantial liability, litigation may also seek injunctive relief which could have an adverse effect on our future operations. 32 Table of Content s For instance, government entities and other groups have filed lawsuits in several states seeking to hold a wide variety of companies that produce fossil fuels liable for the alleged impacts of the greenhouse gas emissions and other alleged harm attributable to those fuels. The lawsuits allege damages as a result of global warming and the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and abatement under various theories. Marathon Oil has been named as a defendant in several of these lawsuits, along with numerous other companies. Similar lawsuits may be filed in other jurisdictions. Additionally, Marathon Oil has been named in various lawsuits, which could include class actions, alleging royalty underpayments in our domestic operations. We intend to vigorously defend ourselves against such claims. Although we have accrued for potential liabilities associated with these lawsuits, those accruals are based on currently available information and involve elements of judgment and significant uncertainties. Accordingly, actual losses may exceed our accruals or we could be required to accrue additional amounts in the future and these amounts could be material. The ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, and we could incur substantial legal costs associated with defending these and similar lawsuits in the future. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 3. Legal Proceedings We are a defendant in a number of legal and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, royalty claims, contract claims, tax disputes and environmental claims. While the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our business or operations. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 25 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of such legal and administrative proceedings. Environmental Proceedings The following is a summary of certain proceedings involving us that were pending or contemplated as of December 31, 2022, under federal and state environmental laws. Government entities have filed lawsuits in several states seeking to hold a wide variety of companies that produce fossil fuels liable for the alleged impacts of the greenhouse gas emissions and other alleged harm attributable to those fuels. The lawsuits allege damages as a result of climate change and the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and abatement under various theories. Marathon Oil has been named as a defendant in several of these lawsuits, along with numerous other companies. Similar lawsuits may be filed in other jurisdictions. While the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the claims made against us are without merit and will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow. As of December 31, 2022, we have sites across the country where remediation is being sought under environmental statutes, both federal and state, or where private parties are seeking remediation through discussions or litigation. Based on currently available information the accrued amount to address the clean-up and remediation costs connected with these sites is not material. We received Notices of Violation ( NOV ) from the EPA related to allegations of violations of the Clean Air Act relating to our operations on the Ford Berthold Indian Reservation between 2015 and 2019. We continue to actively negotiate a draft consent decree with the EPA and Department of Justice containing certain proposed injunctive terms relating to this enforcement action. The resolution of the enforcement action will likely include monetary sanctions and implementation of both environmental mitigation projects and injunctive terms, which would increase both our development costs and operating costs. We do not believe resolution of this matter will have a material adverse effect on our business or operations. We maintain an accrual for estimated future costs related to this matter regarding actions required to retrofit or replace existing equipment, which we expect to incur over multiple years. Our accrual does not include possible monetary sanctions or costs associated with mitigation projects as we are unable to estimate those amounts. Through the date of this filing, there exists substantial uncertainty as to the ultimate result of this matter and it is reasonably possible the result could be materially different from our accrual. We received a NOV from the EPA relating to alleged Clean Air Act violations following flyovers conducted in 2020 over certain of the Company oil and gas facilities in New Mexico. The notice involves alleged emission and permitting violations. The Company has initiated discussions with the EPA to resolve these matters. As we are still investigating these allegations, we are unable to estimate the potential loss associated with this matter, however, it is reasonably possible that the resolution may result in a fine or penalty in excess of $300,000. If our assumptions relating to these costs prove to be inaccurate, future expenditures may exceed our accrued amounts. 33 Table of Content s Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. PART II Item 5. Market for Registrant Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities The principal market on which Marathon Oil common stock is traded is the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) and is traded under the trading symbol MRO . As of January 31, 2023, there were 25,056 registered holders of Marathon Oil common stock. Dividends Our Board of Directors intends to declare and pay dividends on Marathon Oil common stock based on our financial condition and results of operations, although it has no obligation under Delaware law or the restated certificate of incorporation to do so. In determining our dividend policy, the Board of Directors will rely on our consolidated financial statements. Dividends on Marathon Oil common stock are limited to our legally available funds. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities The following table provides information about purchases by Marathon Oil, during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, of equity securities that are registered by Marathon Oil pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As of December 31, 2022, we have approximately $2.5 billion of authorization remaining under the share repurchase program. Period Total Number of Shares Purchased (a) Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs (b) Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (b) 10/01/2022 - 10/31/2022 7,691,855 $ 27.30 7,691,855 $ 715,754,361 11/01/2022 - 11/30/2022 2,247,685 $ 31.14 2,247,685 $ 2,470,000,107 12/01/2022 - 12/31/2022 $ $ 2,470,000,107 Total 9,939,540 $ 28.17 9,939,540 (a) No shares of restricted stock were delivered by employees to Marathon Oil, upon vesting, to satisfy tax withholding requirements. (b) In January 2006, we announced a $2 billion share repurchase program. Our Board of Directors subsequently increased the authorization for repurchases under the program on multiple occasions, as detailed below, resulting in a cumulative authorization of $11.8 billion. This total authorized amount encompasses the entire lifecycle of the program, from 2006 - 2022, which includes share authorization approvals made prior to and subsequent of the spin-off of Marathon Petroleum Corporation in 2011. The individual increases in the authorized share repurchase program were: $500 million in January 2007; $500 million in May 2007; $2 billion in July 2007; $1.2 billion in December 2013; $950 million in July 2019; $1.4 billion in November 2021; $1.4 billion in May 2022; $1.8 billion in November 2022. As of December 31, 2022, we had repurchased 349 million common shares at a cost of approximately $9.3 billion, excluding transaction fees and commissions.

Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Management Discussion and Analysis provides a narrative on the Company results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and capital resources on a historical basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings, as well as those factors that are reasonably likely to affect future earnings. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the information under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report and includes forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties. See Disclosures Regarding Forward-Looking Statements (immediately prior to Part I) and Item 1A. Risk Factors . Each of our two reportable operating segments are organized by geographic location and managed according to the nature of the products and services offered. United States explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas in the United States; and International explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas outside of the United States and produces and markets products manufactured from natural gas, such as LNG and methanol, in E.G. Executive Overview We are an independent exploration and production company, focused on U.S. resource plays: Eagle Ford in Texas, Bakken in North Dakota, STACK and SCOOP in Oklahoma and Permian in New Mexico and Texas. Our U.S. assets are complemented by our international operations in E.G. Our overall business strategy is to responsibly deliver competitive corporate return levels, free cash flow and cash returns to shareholders, all of which are sustainable and resilient through long-term commodity price cycles. We expect to achieve our business strategy by adherence to a disciplined reinvestment rate capital allocation framework that limits our capital expenditures relative to our expected cash flow from operations. Keeping our workforce safe, maintaining a strong balance sheet, responsibly meeting global energy demand with a focus on continuously improving environmental performance, serving as a trusted partner in our local communities and maintaining best in-class corporate governance standards are foundational to the execution of our strategy. Compared to the prior year, we experienced a significant increase in revenues, income from operations and operating cash flow, all of which were driven by higher commodity prices. Total company net sales volumes were roughly flat for 2022 when compared to 2021. Our cash generated from operations during 2022 more than funded our capital program, dividend payments and share repurchases. Our acquisition of the assets and certain related liabilities of Ensign Natural Resources in the Eagle Ford resource play in Texas (discussed below) was funded using cash on hand and incremental debt. These results and activities are consistent with our prioritization of free cash flow generation and adherence to our disciplined capital allocation framework. Key 2022 highlights include: Improved financial results Net cash provided by operating activities was $5.4 billion in 2022 as compared to $3.2 billion in 2021. Our net income was $3.6 billion in 2022 as compared to net income of $946 million in 2021. Included in our financial results: Revenues from contracts with customers increased $1.9 billion compared to 2021 as realized commodity prices were significantly higher. Income from our equity method investments totaled $613 million, which was an increase of $360 million compared to 2021, due to higher realized prices. We recorded a net loss on commodity derivatives of $114 million, as compared to a net loss of $383 million in 2021, which increased income by $269 million. Production expense increased $156 million compared to 2021 as a result of higher workover activity and inflationary pressures on labor, fuel, chemicals and services. As a result of higher income before taxes, our provision for income taxes increased by $109 million compared to 2021. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the increase in income taxes. Prioritized return of capital to investors and maintained investment grade balance sheet During 2022, we repurchased approximately $2.8 billion of shares through our share repurchase program. Paid $220 million of dividends, or $0.32 per share, during 2022, compared to dividends paid of $0.18 per share during 2021. As of December 31, 2022, we have $334 million in cash and $2.4 billion of total liquidity. 35 Table of Contents All three primary credit ratings agencies continue to rate us as investment grade subsequent to our acquisition of additional acreage in the Eagle Ford (see below). Eagle Ford resource play acquisition In December 2022, we closed on a transaction to acquire approximately 130,000 net proved and unproved acres, with an average 97% working interest, from Ensign Natural Resources for cash consideration of $3.0 billion, which was subject to customary closing adjustments. Acquired acreage nearly doubles our net acreage position in the Eagle Ford, increasing our inventory of undrilled locations. ESG highlights and initiatives Continued to execute on a combination of near-term (2023), medium-term (2025) and longer-term (2030) goals covering GHG emissions intensity, methane intensity, natural gas capture and zero routine flaring. Released a Human Rights Policy covering our global operations to further acknowledge our longstanding commitment to the dignity and rights of all people. Continued Board of Directors refreshment through appointment of two new directors. Outlook In February 2023, we announced a 2023 capital budget of $1.9 billion to $2.0 billion that prioritizes free cash flow generation over production growth, consistent with our disciplined capital allocation framework.

Following the initial COVID outbreak in 2020, commodity prices steadily increased due to rising oil demand as global economic activity recovered. However, more recently in 2022, commodity prices have experienced significant volatility due to geopolitical events, including Russia invasion of Ukraine, and demand impacts tied to macroeconomic conditions from global inflation. Price volatility was also exacerbated by ongoing OPEC+ petroleum supply limitations, COVID related impacts, strategic petroleum reserve releases and economic sanctions involving producer countries. We continue to expect commodity price volatility given the complex global dynamics of supply and demand that exist in the market . See Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition Critical Accounting Estimates for further discussion on how volatility in commodity prices could impact us. 37 Table of Contents United States The following table presents our average price realizations and the related benchmarks for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas for 2022, 2021 and 2020. 2022 Increase (Decrease) 2021 Increase (Decrease) 2020 Average Price Realizations (a) Crude oil and condensate (per bbl) (b) $ 95.58 43 % $ 66.88 86 % $ 35.93 Natural gas liquids (per bbl) (c) 34.55 20 % 28.89 156 % 11.28 Natural gas (per mcf) (d) 6.11 34 % 4.57 158 % 1.77 Benchmarks WTI crude oil average of daily prices (per bbl) $ 94.33 38 % $ 68.11 73 % $ 39.34 Magellan East Houston ( MEH ) crude oil average of daily prices (per bbl) 97.74 41 % 69.25 73 % 39.95 Mont Belvieu NGLs (per bbl) (e) 35.78 23 % 29.17 99 % 14.69 Henry Hub natural gas settlement date average (per mmbtu) 6.64 73 % 3.84 85 % 2.08 (a) Excludes gains or losses on commodity derivative instruments.

(e) Bloomberg Finance LLP: Y-grade Mix NGL of 55% ethane, 25% propane, 5% butane, 8% isobutane and 7% natural gasoline. Crude oil and condensate Price realizations may differ from benchmarks due to the quality and location of the product. Natural gas liquids The majority of our sales volumes are sold at reference to Mont Belvieu prices. Natural gas A significant portion of our volumes are sold at bid-week prices, or first-of-month indices relative to our producing areas. International (E.G.) The following table presents our average price realizations and the related benchmark for crude oil for 2022, 2021 and 2020. 2022 Increase (Decrease) 2021 Increase (Decrease) 2020 Average Price Realizations Crude oil and condensate (per bbl) $ 68.67 20 % $ 57.46 103 % $ 28.36 Natural gas liquids (per bbl) 1.00 % 1.00 % 1.00 Natural gas (per mcf) 0.24 % 0.24 % 0.24 Benchmark Brent (Europe) crude oil (per bbl) (a) $ 100.78 43 % $ 70.68 69 % $ 41.76 (a) Average of monthly prices obtained from the United States Energy Information Agency website. Crude oil and condensate Alba field liquids production is primarily condensate. We generally sell our share of condensate in relation to the Brent crude benchmark. Alba Plant LLC processes the rich hydrocarbon gas which is supplied by the Alba field under a fixed-price long term contract. Alba Plant LLC extracts NGLs and condensate which is then sold by Alba Plant LLC at market prices, with our share of the revenue reflected in income from equity method investments on the consolidated statements of income. Alba Plant LLC delivers the processed dry natural gas to the Alba Unit Parties for distribution and sale to AMPCO and EG LNG. Natural gas liquids Wet gas is sold to Alba Plant LLC at a fixed-price long term contract resulting in realized prices not tracking market price. Alba Plant LLC extracts and keeps NGLs, which are sold at market price, with our share of income from Alba Plant LLC being reflected in the income from equity method investments on the consolidated statements of income. 38 Table of Contents Natural gas Dry natural gas, processed by Alba Plant LLC on behalf of the Alba Unit Parties, is sold by the Alba field to EG LNG and AMPCO at fixed-price contracts resulting in realized prices not tracking market price. The gas sales contracts between Alba Unit and EG LNG and AMPCO expire on December 31, 2023 and in 2026, respectively. We derive additional value from the equity investment in our downstream gas processing units EG LNG and AMPCO. EG LNG sells LNG on a market-based contract and AMPCO markets methanol at market prices. We are progressing new LNG agreements expected to be effective on January 1, 2024, and our intention is to secure increased exposure to global LNG market prices. Alba Plant LLC and EG LNG process third-party gas from the Alen field under a combination of a tolling and a market linked profit-sharing arrangement, the benefits of which are included in our respective share of income from equity method investees. This profit-sharing arrangement provides exposure to global LNG market prices.

We have commodity derivative contracts that settle against various indices. We record commodity derivative gains/losses as the index pricing and forward curves change each period. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Income from equity method investments increased $360 million in 2022 from 2021. Our investees benefited from higher price realizations in 2022, partially offset by lower volumes. Production expenses increased $156 million during 2022 from 2021, primarily as a result of the U.S. segment higher workover activity and inflationary pressures on labor, fuel, chemicals and services. 39 Table of Contents The following table provides production expense and production expense rates for each segment: (In millions; rate in $ per boe) 2022 2021 Increase (Decrease) 2022 2021 Increase (Decrease) Production Expense and Rate Expense Rate United States $ 625 $ 480 30 % $ 6.03 $ 4.60 31 % International $ 65 $ 54 20 % $ 3.04 $ 2.45 24 % Exploration expenses include unproved property impairments, dry well costs, geological and geophysical and other costs. The $26 million decrease in exploration expenses in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by lower impairment of unproved property leases. See Note 6 and Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail. The following table summarizes the components of exploration expenses: Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2022 2021 Increase (Decrease) Exploration Expenses Unproved property impairments $ 65 $ 92 (29) % Dry well costs 36 33 9 % Geological and geophysical 1 5 (80) % Other 8 6 33 % Total exploration expenses $ 110 $ 136 (19) % Depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased $313 million in 2022 from 2021, primarily as a result of lower DD&A (expense per boe) rate impacted by field-level changes in reserves. In addition, the DD&A rate is impacted by capitalized costs and the sales volume mix between fields. Our segments apply the units-of-production method to the majority of their assets, including capitalized asset retirement costs; therefore volumes have an impact on DD&A expense. The following table provides DD&A expense and DD&A expense rates for each segment: (In millions; rate in $ per boe) 2022 2021 Increase (Decrease) 2022 2021 Increase (Decrease) DD&A Expense and Rate Expense Rate United States $ 1,675 $ 1,972 (15) % $ 16.16 $ 18.90 (14) % International $ 60 $ 68 (12) % $ 2.82 $ 3.07 (8) % Impairments decreased $53 million in 2022 from 2021. Impairments in 2021 included $30 million impairment related to an increase in the estimated future decommissioning costs of certain non-producing wells, pipelines and production facilities for previously divested offshore assets located in the Gulf of Mexico and a $24 million impairment as we decommissioned certain Eagle Ford central facilities. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the impairments in further detail. Taxes other than income include production, severance and ad valorem taxes, primarily in the U.S., which tend to increase or decrease in relation to revenue and sales volumes. Taxes other than income increased $139 million in 2022 from 2021 period primarily due to higher price realizations in the U.S. segment in 2022. General and administrative expenses increased $17 million in 2022 from 2021. The higher costs in 2022 include transaction fees associated with our acquisition of the Eagle Ford assets of Ensign Natural Resources during the fourth quarter of 2022. Loss on early extinguishment of debt decreased to nil in 2022 as compared to $121 million in 2021 due to make-whole call provisions paid upon redemption of our $500 million 2022 Notes in the second quarter of 2021 and our $900 million 2025 Notes in the third quarter of 2021. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail. Provision for income taxes reflects an effective rate of 4% in 2022 as compared to 6% in 2021. The 2022 effective tax rate includes a deferred tax benefit of $685 million from the first quarter release of the valuation allowance on certain U.S. and state deferred tax assets. In 2021, we had a full valuation allowance on net federal deferred tax assets, which resulted in no federal tax expense on U.S. operations. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail. 40 Table of Contents Segment Results: 2022 compared to 2021 Segment Income Segment income represents income that excludes certain items not allocated to our operating segments, net of income taxes. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding items not allocated to the operating segments. The following table reconciles segment income to net income. Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2022 2021 United States $ 2,740 $ 1,277 International 585 317 Segment income 3,325 1,594 Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes 287 (648) Net income $ 3,612 $ 946 United States segment income in 2022 was $2.7 billion of income versus $1.3 billion of income in 2021. The increase in income was primarily due to higher price realizations and lower DD&A expenses. These favorable changes were partially offset by higher income taxes, production expenses and production taxes in 2022. International segment income in 2022 was $585 million of income versus $317 million of income in 2021. The increase in income was primarily due to higher prices realized by our equity method investees, partially offset by higher incomes taxes. Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes in 2022 was income of $287 million of income versus a loss of $648 million for the same period in 2021. The increase was primarily due to the first quarter 2022 release of the valuation allowance on certain U.S. and state deferred tax assets resulting in a deferred tax benefit of $685 million. In addition, the prior year included $121 million of debt extinguishment costs. Consolidated Results of Operations: 2021 compared to 2020 A detailed discussion of the year-over-year changes from the year ended December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2020 can be found in the Management Discussion and Analysis section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 and is available via the SEC website at www.sec.gov and on our website at www.marathonoil.com . Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, Cash Flows and Liquidity Commodity prices are the most significant factor impacting our revenues, profitability, operating cash flows, the amount of capital we invest in our business, principal debt repayments, payment of dividends and funding of share repurchases. We generated significant positive cash flow from operations during 2022. We continue to expect volatility in commodity prices and that could impact the amount of cash flow from operations we generate. As previously discussed in the Outlook section, our capital budget for 2023 is $1.9 billion to $2.0 billion. Our top priorities for using cash provided by operations are to fund our capital budget and return capital to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases, and service our outstanding debt. We believe our current liquidity level, cash flow from operations and ability to access the capital markets provides us with the flexibility to fund our business across a wide range of commodity price environments. 41 Table of Contents Cash Flows The following table presents sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for 2022 and 2021: Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2022 2021 Sources of cash and cash equivalents Net cash provided by operating activities $ 5,428 $ 3,239 Borrowings 1,500 Proceeds from revolving credit facility 450 Equity method investments - return of capital 12 61 Other 23 23 Total sources of cash and cash equivalents $ 7,413 $ 3,323 Uses of cash and cash equivalents Additions to property, plant and equipment $ (1,450) $ (1,046) Acquisitions, net of cash acquired (3,177) (47) Shares repurchased under buyback programs (2,754) (724) Debt repayments (35) (1,400) Debt extinguishment costs (117) Dividends paid (220) (141) Purchases of shares for tax withholding obligations (22) (10) Other (1) Total uses of cash and cash equivalents $ (7,659) $ (3,485) Sources of cash and cash equivalents Cash flows generated from operating activities in 2022 were 68% higher compared to 2021, primarily as a result of higher realized commodity prices. The increase was partially offset by higher production expense, primarily as a result of the U.S. segment higher workover activity and inflationary pressures on labor, fuel, chemicals and services during 2022. Additionally, taxes other than income increased compared to 2021 primarily due to higher price realizations in the U.S. segment in 2022. As of December 31, 2022, we had $1.5 billion in borrowings under our Term Loan Facility and $450 million in borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below for further information. Uses of cash and cash equivalents On November 2, 2022, we executed a definitive purchase agreement to acquire the assets and certain related liabilities of Ensign Natural Resources in the Eagle Ford resource play in Texas. The transaction was closed on December 27, 2022, for cash consideration of $3.0 billion, which was subject to customary closing adjustments. We funded the acquisition using a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under our Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility. We believe the transaction will be accretive to our financial metrics while increasing our scale in the Eagle Ford by adding high working interest acreage to our inventory portfolio that is located adjacent to our existing position. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2022, we increased our ownership interest in operated Eagle Ford resource play acreage for cash consideration of approximately $135 million. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to our 2022 acquisitions. During the year ended 2022, we repurchased 113 million shares of our common stock pursuant to the share repurchase program at a cost of $2.8 billion, paid dividends of $220 million and redeemed the $32 million 9.375% Senior Notes on the maturity date. Additionally, we repurchased $22 million of shares related to our tax withholding obligations associated with the vesting of employee restricted stock awards and restricted stock units; these repurchases do not impact our share repurchase program authorization. 42 Table of Contents The following table shows capital expenditures by segment and reconciles to additions to property, plant and equipment as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows: Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2022 2021 United States $ 1,463 $ 1,018 International 2 Corporate 15 14 Total capital expenditures (accrued) 1,480 1,032 Change in capital expenditure accrual (30) 14 Total use of cash and cash equivalents for property, plant and equipment $ 1,450 $ 1,046 The increase in our capital expenditures for the U.S. segment in 2022 compared to 2021 largely reflects inflationary pressures related to oil field services, labor, drilling materials and equipment. Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources and Available Liquidity Our main sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, internally generated cash flow from operations, capital market transactions and our Revolving Credit Facility. At December 31, 2022, we had approximately $2.4 billion of liquidity consisting of $334 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2.1 billion available under our Revolving Credit Facility. Our working capital requirements are supported by our cash and cash equivalents and our Revolving Credit Facility. We may draw on our Revolving Credit Facility to meet short-term cash requirements or issue debt or equity securities through the shelf registration statement discussed below as part of our longer-term liquidity and capital management program. Because of the alternatives available to us as discussed above, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity are adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements including our capital spending programs, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities, dividends and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 25 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of how our commitments and contingencies could affect our available liquidity. General economic conditions, commodity prices and financial, business and other factors could affect our operations and our ability to access the capital markets. We maintain investment grade ratings at all three primary credit rating agencies. A downgrade in our credit ratings could increase our future cost of financing or limit our ability to access capital and could result in additional credit support requirements. We do not have any triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an event of default in the case of a downgrade of our credit ratings. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of how a downgrade in our credit ratings could affect us. We may incur additional debt in order to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, acquisitions or development activities or for general corporate or other purposes. A higher level of indebtedness could increase the risk that our liquidity and financial flexibility deteriorates. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a further discussion of how our level of indebtedness could affect us. Credit Arrangements and Borrowings On November 22, 2022, we entered into a two-year $1.5 billion Term Loan Facility and borrowed the full amount thereunder on December 27, 2022. The Term Loan Facility can be prepaid without penalty. On July 28, 2022, we executed the seventh amendment to our Revolving Credit Facility. The primary changes to the Revolving Credit Facility effected by this amendment were to (i) extend the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility by three years to July 28, 2027, (ii) decrease the size of the Revolving Credit Facility from $3.1 billion to $2.5 billion, (iii) replace the LIBOR interest rate benchmark with SOFR and (iv) implement certain revisions to the Pricing Schedule. As of December 31, 2022, we have borrowed $450 million under our Revolving Credit Facility. Both our Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility include a covenant requiring that our total debt to total capitalization ratio not exceed 65% as of the last day of the fiscal quarter. Our total debt-to-capital ratio was 26% at December 31, 2022. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 17 for further information related to the Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility. 43 Table of Contents Other Sources of Liquidity We have an effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC pursuant to which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer for purposes of SEC rules, subject to market conditions, are permitted to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt, equity securities and other capital instruments, if and when necessary or perceived by us to be opportune, in one or more public offerings. Capital Requirements Our material cash requirements include the following contractual and other potential or expected obligations: Capital Spending Our approved capital budget for 2023 is $1.9 billion to $2.0 billion. Additional details were previously discussed in Outlook . Debt As of December 31, 2022, we had $5.9 billion of total long-term debt outstanding, of which $402 million is due within the next year. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 17 for a listing of our long-term debt maturities. Anticipated cash payments for interest related to our fixed-rate debt in future periods are $190 million for 2023, $340 million for 2024-2025, $322 million for 2026-2027 and $1.1 billion for the remaining years for a total of $2.0 billion. As a result of the increase in debt incurred arising from the acquisition of the Eagle Ford assets of Ensign Natural Resources in December 2022, we expect interest expense in 2023, and cash payments thereon, to be materially higher as compared to 2022. Assuming interest rates in effect at December 31, 2022, and repayments at scheduled maturities, anticipated cash payments for interest related to our floating-rate debt in future periods are $119 million for 2023, $146 million for 2024-2025 and $42 million for 2026-2027. As noted above, the Term Loan Facility can be prepaid without penalty. Share Repurchase Program Effective November 2, 2022, our Board of Directors increased our remaining share repurchase program authorization to $2.5 billion. The total remaining share repurchase authorization was approximately $2.5 billion at December 31, 2022. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, we repurchased approximately $133 million of shares of our common stock through February 15, 2023. Leases For future lease obligations, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. Dividends On January 25, 2023, our Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.10 per share for the fourth quarter of 2022. The dividend is payable on March 10, 2023, to shareholders of record on February 15, 2023. Pension and Postretirement Plans Estimated cash payments for our pension and other postretirement benefits plans in future periods are $33 million for 2023, $60 million for 2024-2025, $53 million for 2026-2027 and $125 million for the remaining years for a total of $271 million. Income Taxes As described in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the IRA was signed into law during 2022 and we are awaiting further guidance from the U.S. Treasury regarding the calculation of minimum income tax liabilities. We continue to assess whether or not we expect to have a minimum income tax liability. If we conclude that we do trigger the minimum income tax, we may have to make estimated tax payments. 44 Table of Contents Other Cash Obligations The table below provides aggregated information on our consolidated obligations to make future payments under existing contracts as of December 31, 2022.

(d) This table does not include the estimated discounted liability for dismantlement, abandonment and restoration costs of oil and gas properties of $340 million. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. Transactions with Related Parties Offshore E.G., we own a 64% working interest in the Alba Unit. Onshore E.G., we own a 52% interest in an LPG processing plant, a 56% interest in an LNG production facility and a 45% interest in a methanol production plant, each through equity method investees. We sell our natural gas from the Alba Unit to these equity method investees as the feedstock for their production processes. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Off-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. We had no material off-balance sheet arrangements for December 31, 2022. Management Discussion and Analysis of Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies We have incurred and will continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately offset by the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes. These laws generally provide for control of pollutants released into the environment and require responsible parties to undertake remediation of hazardous waste disposal sites. Penalties may be imposed for noncompliance. We accrue for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated. As environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise, charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required. New or expanded environmental requirements, which could increase our environmental costs, may arise in the future on both state and federal levels. We strive to comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment, but as not all costs are fixed or presently determinable (even under existing legislation) and may be affected by future legislation or regulations, it is not possible to predict all of the ultimate costs of compliance, including remediation costs that may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed. For more information on environmental regulations, litigation and contingencies that impact us, or could impact us, see Item 1. Business Environmental, Health and Safety Matters , Item 1A. Risk Factors , Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 25 . 45 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods. Accounting estimates are considered to be critical if (1) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and (2) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. Estimated Quantities of Net Reserves We use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities. The successful efforts method inherently relies on the estimation of proved crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas reserves. The amount of estimated proved reserve volumes affect, among other things, whether certain costs are capitalized or expensed, the amount and timing of costs depreciated, depleted or amortized into net income and the presentation of supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities. In addition, the expected future cash flows to be generated by producing properties are used for testing impairment and the expected future taxable income available to realize deferred tax assets, also in part, rely on estimates of quantities of net reserves. Refer to the applicable sections below for further discussion of these accounting estimates. The estimation of quantities of net reserves is a highly technical process performed by petroleum engineers and geoscientists for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, which is based upon several underlying assumptions. The reserve estimates may change as additional information becomes available and as contractual, operational, economic and political conditions change. We evaluate our reserves using drilling results, reservoir performance, subsurface interpretation and future plans to develop acreage. Technologies used in proved reserves estimation includes statistical analysis of production performance, decline curve analysis, pressure and rate transient analysis, pressure gradient analysis, reservoir simulation and volumetric analysis. The observed statistical nature of production performance coupled with highly certain reservoir continuity or quality and sufficient proved developed locations establish the reasonable certainty criteria required for booking proved reserves. As per SEC requirements, proved undeveloped reserve volumes are limited to activity in the 5-year plan and wells that will be developed within 5 years of initial booking. The data for a given reservoir may also change over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity and future development costs, production history and continual reassessment of the viability of future production volumes under varying economic conditions. Reserve estimates are based on an unweighted average of commodity prices in the prior 12-month period using the closing prices on the first day of each month, as defined by the SEC. The table below provides the 2022 SEC pricing for certain benchmark prices: 2022 SEC Pricing WTI crude oil (per bbl) $ 93.67 Henry Hub natural gas (per mmbtu) $ 6.36 Brent crude oil (per bbl) $ 100.25 Mont Belvieu NGLs (per bbl) $ 36.59 When determining the December 31, 2022, proved reserves for each property, the benchmark prices listed above were adjusted using price differentials that account for property-specific quality and location differences. If the future average commodity prices are below the average prices used to determine proved reserves at December 31, 2022, it could have an adverse effect on our estimates of proved reserve volumes and the value of our business. Future reserve revisions could also result from changes in capital funding, drilling plans and governmental regulation, among other things. It is difficult to estimate the magnitude of any potential price change and the effect on proved reserves, due to numerous factors. For further discussion of risks associated with our estimation of proved reserves, see Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors . 46 Table of Contents Depreciation and depletion of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas producing properties is determined by the units-of-production method and could change with revisions to estimated proved reserves. The following table illustrates, on average, the sensitivity of each segment units-of-production DD&A per boe and pretax income to a hypothetical 10% change in 2022 proved reserves based on 2022 production.

There are three approaches for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities: the market approach, the income approach and the cost approach, each of which includes multiple valuation techniques. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach uses valuation techniques to measure fair value by converting future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, into a single present value, or range of present values, using current market expectations about those future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace the service capacity of an asset. This is often referred to as current replacement cost. The cost approach assumes that the fair value would not exceed what it would cost a market participant to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility, adjusted for obsolescence. The fair value accounting standards do not prescribe which valuation technique should be used when measuring fair value and do not prioritize among the techniques. These standards establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in applying the various valuation techniques. Inputs broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make pricing decisions, including assumptions about risk. Level 1 inputs are given the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy while Level 3 inputs are given the lowest priority. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: Level 1 Observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets as of the measurement date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 2 Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. These are inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date. Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data and may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management best estimate of fair value. Valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs are favored. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest priority level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities within the levels of the fair value hierarchy. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures regarding our fair value measurements. Significant uses of fair value measurements include: assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination; impairment assessments of long-lived assets; impairment assessments of equity method investments; impairment assessments of goodwill; recorded value of derivative instruments; and recorded value of pension plan assets. The need to test long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment can be based on several indicators, including a significant reduction in prices of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, sustained declines in our common stock, reductions to our capital budget, unfavorable adjustments to reserves, significant changes in the expected timing of production, other changes to contracts or changes in the regulatory environment in which the property is located. 47 Table of Contents Assets and Liabilities Acquired in a Business Combination In accounting for business combinations, the purchase price paid to acquire a business is allocated to its assets and liabilities based on the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition. If applicable, any excess of the purchase price over the fair value is recorded as goodwill. A significant amount of judgment is involved in estimating the individual fair values of property, plant and equipment. The most significant assumptions relate to the estimated fair values allocated to proved and unproved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas properties. Estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired can have a significant effect on our results of operations in the future. We use all available information to make these fair value determinations and, for certain acquisitions, engage third-party valuation experts for assistance, including the 2022 Ensign acquisition. The fair values used to allocate the purchase price of an acquisition are often estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method, which requires us to estimate reserves as described above under Estimated Quantities of Net Reserves, project related future cash inflows and outflows and apply an appropriate discount rate. The estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain. Accordingly, actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value. Significant assumptions include: Future crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas realized prices. Our estimates of future prices are based on our analysis of market supply and demand and consideration of market price indicators. Although these commodity prices may experience extreme volatility in any given year, we believe long-term industry prices are driven by global market supply and demand. To estimate supply, we consider numerous factors, including the worldwide resource base, depletion rates and OPEC production policies. We believe demand is largely driven by global economic factors, such as population and income growth, governmental policies and vehicle stocks. There has been significant volatility in crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas prices and estimates of such future prices are inherently imprecise. See Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion on commodity prices. Estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas. Such quantities are based on a combination of risk-adjusted reserves and resources such that the combined volumes represent the most likely expectation of recovery. See Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion on reserves. Expected timing of production. Production forecasts are the outcome of engineering studies which estimate reserves, as well as expected capital programs. The actual timing of the production could be different than the projection. Cash flows realized later in the projection period are less valuable than those realized earlier due to the time value of money. The expected timing of production that we use in our fair value estimates is consistent with that used in our planning and capital investment reviews. Discount rate commensurate with the risks involved. We apply a discount rate to our expected cash flows based on a variety of factors, including market and economic conditions, operational risk, regulatory risk and political risk. A higher discount rate decreases the net present value of cash flows. Future operating and development costs. Our estimates of future operating & development costs are based upon a combination of authorized spending and internal forecasts. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our 2022 acquisition of the Eagle Ford assets of Ensign Natural Resources, which was accounted for as a business combination. Impairment Assessments of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets in use are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. For purposes of an impairment evaluation, long-lived assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified, which generally is field-by-field or, in certain instances, by logical grouping of assets if there is significant shared infrastructure or contractual terms that cause economic interdependency amongst separate, discrete fields. If the sum of the undiscounted estimated cash flows from the use of the asset group and its eventual disposition is less than the carrying value of an asset group, the carrying value is written down to the estimated fair value. Fair value calculated for the purpose of testing our long-lived assets for impairment is estimated using the present value of expected future cash flows method and comparative market prices when appropriate. Significant judgment is involved in performing these fair value estimates since the results are based on forecasted assumptions. Significant assumptions are consistent with those discussed in the Assets and Liabilities Acquired in a Business Combination section above. 48 Table of Contents We base our fair value estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonably likely to occur. An estimate of the sensitivity to changes in assumptions in our undiscounted cash flow calculations is not practicable, given the numerous assumptions (e.g. reserves, pace and timing of development plans, commodity prices, capital expenditures, operating costs, drilling and development costs, inflation and discount rates) that can materially affect our estimates. Unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions would likely be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions. For example, the impact of sustained reduced commodity prices on future undiscounted cash flows would likely be partially offset by lower costs. During 2022, we recorded impairment charges totaling $72 million related to proved and unproved properties. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of impairments recorded in 2022, 2021 and 2020 and the related fair value measurements. Impairment Assessment of Equity Method Investments Equity method investments are assessed for impairment whenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value may have occurred. When a loss is deemed to have occurred that is other than temporary, the carrying value of the equity method investment is written down to fair value. Fair value calculated for the purpose of testing our equity method investees for impairment is estimated using the present value of expected future cash flows method. Significant judgment is involved in performing these fair value estimates since the results are based on forecasted assumptions and the performance of entities that we do not control. Significant assumptions include: Future condensate, NGL, LNG, natural gas and methanol prices. Our estimates of future prices are based on our analysis of market supply and demand and consideration of market price indicators. Although these commodity prices may experience extreme volatility in any given year, we believe long-term industry prices are driven by global market supply and demand. To estimate supply, we consider numerous factors, including the worldwide resource base, depletion rates and OPEC production policies. We believe demand is largely driven by global economic factors, such as population and income growth, and governmental policies. There has been significant volatility in commodity prices and estimates of such future prices are inherently imprecise. Estimated quantities of feedstock condensate, NGLs and natural gas processed by our investees. There are two primary sets of inputs used to estimate feedstock volumes processed by our investees. The first input involves hydrocarbons produced from our Alba field. Our equity method investees currently process hydrocarbons from our Alba field, which consists of condensate, NGLs and natural gas reserves. Estimated quantities of hydrocarbons processed from our Alba field are based on a combination of proved reserves and risk-weighted probable reserves and resources such that the combined volumes represent the most likely expectation of recovery. The second input involves our estimate of future third-party gas to be processed by our investees. Our investees have capacity to process hydrocarbons from sources other than our Alba field. In 2021, the existing Alba Plant LLC LPG processing plant and the EGHoldings LNG production facility began processing natural gas produced from the third party-owned Alen Unit. Estimated natural gas volumes processed from the Alen Unit are based on forecasts received from the operator of the Alen Unit. Expected timing of production. Production forecasts are the outcome of engineering studies which estimate reserves, as well as expected capital programs. The actual timing of the production could be different from the projection. Cash flows realized later in the projection period are less valuable than those realized earlier due to the time value of money. The expected timing of production from the Alba field that we use in our fair value estimates is consistent with that used in our planning and capital investment reviews. The expected timing of production from the Alen Unit is consistent with forecasts received from the operator of that field. Discount rate commensurate with the risks involved. We apply a discount rate to our expected cash flows based on a variety of factors, including market and economic conditions, operational risk, regulatory risk and political risk. A higher discount rate decreases the net present value of cash flows. We base our fair value estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonably likely to occur. This includes the estimated dividends and/or return of capital we expect to be paid by our equity method investees, which are directly affected by the significant assumptions described in the preceding paragraphs. An estimate of the sensitivity to changes in assumptions in our cash flow calculations is not practicable, given the numerous other assumptions (e.g. reserves, commodity prices, operating costs, inflation and discount rates) that can materially affect our estimates. Unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions would likely be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions. During 2022 and 2021, we had no impairments related to our equity method investments. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the impairment recognized during 2020. 49 Table of Contents Impairment Assessments of Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or between annual tests when events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value may have been reduced below its carrying value. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. Our reporting units are the same as our reporting segments, of which historically only International included goodwill. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Our policy is to first assess the qualitative factors in order to determine whether the fair value of our International reporting unit is more likely than not less than its carrying amount. Certain qualitative factors used in our evaluation include, among other things, the results of the most recent quantitative assessment of the goodwill impairment test; macroeconomic conditions; industry and market conditions (including commodity prices and cost factors); overall financial performance; and other relevant entity-specific events. If, after considering these events and circumstances we determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the International reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative goodwill test is performed. The quantitative goodwill test is performed using a combination of market and income approaches. The market approach references observable inputs specific to us and our industry, such as the price of our common equity, our enterprise value and valuation multiples of us and our peers from the investor analyst community. The income approach utilizes discounted cash flows, which are based on forecasted assumptions. Key assumptions to the income approach are the same as those described above regarding our impairment assessment of long-lived assets and are consistent with those that management uses to make business decisions. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the $95 million full impairment of our goodwill in 2020. Derivatives We record all derivative instruments at fair value. Fair value measurements for all our derivative instruments are based on observable market-based inputs that are corroborated by market data and are discussed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. Additional information about derivatives and their valuation may be found in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk . Pension Plan Assets Pension plan assets are measured at fair value. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the fair value of plan assets and the presentation of the fair value of our defined benefit pension plan assets by level within the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in numerous taxing jurisdictions worldwide. Estimates of income taxes to be recorded involve interpretation of complex tax laws and assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our U.S. federal income taxes. Uncertainty exists regarding tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns which remain subject to examination, along with positions expected to be taken in future returns. We provide for unrecognized tax benefits, based on the technical merits, when it is more likely than not that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained upon examination. Adjustments are made to the uncertain tax positions when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit; court proceedings; changes in applicable tax laws, including tax case rulings and legislative guidance; or expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. We have recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured at enacted tax rates, for temporary differences between book basis and tax basis, tax credit carryforwards and operating loss carryforwards. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets to the expected realizable amount by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In assessing the need for additional or adjustments to existing valuation allowances, we consider all available positive and negative evidence. Positive evidence includes reversals of temporary differences, forecasts of future taxable income, assessment of future business assumptions and applicable tax planning strategies that are prudent and feasible. Negative evidence includes losses in recent years, as well as the forecasts of future loss in the realizable period. In making our assessment regarding valuation allowances, we weight the evidence based on objectivity. We base our future taxable income estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonably likely to occur. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the estimation of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions and the assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our U.S. federal income taxes. Future operating conditions can be affected by numerous factors, including (i) future crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas prices, (ii) estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, (iii) expected timing of production, and (iv) future capital requirements. An estimate of the sensitivity to changes in assumptions resulting in future taxable income calculations is not practicable, given the numerous assumptions that can materially affect our estimates. Unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions would likely be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions. For example, the impact of sustained reduced commodity prices on future taxable income would likely be partially offset by lower capital expenditures. 50 Table of Contents Based on the assumptions and judgments described above, during the first quarter of 2022, we re-evaluated the realizability of U.S. and state deferred tax assets and determined that a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets was no longer necessary. As such, we recorded a non-cash deferred tax benefit in the first quarter of 2022 for $685 million. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations Accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions, the most significant of which relates to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations. We develop our estimate of demographic effects and utilize the work of third-party actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations. We have selected different discount rates for our U.S. pension plans and our other U.S. postretirement benefit plans due to the different projected benefit payment patterns. In determining the assumed discount rates, our methods include a review of market yields on high-quality corporate debt and use of our third-party actuary discount rate model. This model calculates an equivalent single discount rate for the projected benefit plan cash flows using a yield curve derived from bond yields. The yield curve represents a series of annualized individual spot discount rates from 0.5 to 99 years. The bonds used are rated AA or higher by a recognized rating agency, callable bonds (with the exception of those meeting specific criteria including having more than 10 years remaining until maturity) and outlier bonds (bonds that have a yield to maturity that significantly deviates from the average yield within each maturity grouping) are removed. Each issue is required to have at least $300 million par value outstanding. The constructed yield curve is based on those bonds representing the 50% highest yielding issuances within each defined maturity group. The asset rate of return assumption for the funded U.S. plan considers the plan asset mix (currently targeted at approximately 47% equity and 53% other fixed income securities), past performance and other factors. Certain components of the asset mix are modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation, debt returns and stock yields. Compensation change assumptions are based on historical experience, anticipated future management actions and demographics of the benefit plans. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements includes detailed information about the assumptions used to calculate the components of our annual defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan expense, as well as the obligations and accumulated other comprehensive income reported on the consolidated balance sheets. Contingent Liabilities We accrue contingent liabilities for environmental remediation, tax deficiencies related to operating taxes, as well as tax disputes and litigation claims when such contingencies are probable and estimable. Actual costs can differ from estimates for many reasons. For instance, settlement costs for claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on responsibility and assessments of the amount of damages. Similarly, liabilities for environmental remediation may vary from estimates because of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation, additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination and improvements in technology. Our in-house legal counsel regularly assesses these contingent liabilities. In certain circumstances outside legal counsel is utilized. We generally record losses related to these types of contingencies as other operating expense or general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income, except for tax contingencies unrelated to income taxes, which are recorded as taxes other than income (such as production, severance and ad valorem taxes). For additional information on contingent liabilities, see Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Management Discussion and Analysis of Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies . An estimate of the sensitivity to net income if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practical because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, in terms of both the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss. 51 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to market risks in the normal course of business including commodity price risk and interest rate risk. We employ various strategies, including the use of financial derivatives to manage the risks related to commodity price and interest rate fluctuations. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 15 and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for detail relating to our open commodity derivative positions, including underlying notional quantities, how they are reported in our consolidated financial statements and how their fair values are measured. Commodity Price Risk Our strategy is to obtain competitive prices for our products and allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand. However, management will periodically protect prices on forecasted sales to support cash flow and liquidity, as deemed appropriate. We may use a variety of commodity derivative instruments, including futures, forwards, swaps and combinations of options, as part of an overall program to manage commodity price risk in our business. Our consolidated results for the years 2020 through 2022 were impacted by commodity derivatives related to a portion of our forecasted United States sales. As of December 31, 2022, we had open commodity derivatives related to natural gas. Based on the December 31, 2022 published natural gas futures prices, a hypothetical 10% change (per MMBtu for natural gas) would change the fair values of our commodity derivative positions to the following: (In millions) Fair Value at December 31, 2022 Hypothetical Price Increase of 10% Hypothetical Price Decrease of 10% Derivative asset Natural Gas $ 10 $ 8 $ 14 Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2022, our portfolio of current and long-term debt is comprised of floating rate debt and fixed-rate instruments. Our Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility are floating rate debt instruments, which exposes us to the risk of earnings or cash flow losses as the result of potential increases in market interest rates. At December 31, 2022, we had $2.0 billion in outstanding borrowings under floating rate debt instruments. Assuming no change in the amount of floating rate debt outstanding, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the average interest rate under these borrowings would have increased our interest expense by approximately $20 million. Actual results may vary due to changes in the amount of floating rate debt outstanding. At December 31, 2022, we had $4.0 billion in outstanding borrowings under fixed-rate debt instruments. Our sensitivity to interest rate movements and corresponding changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt portfolio affects our results of operations and cash flows only when we elect to repurchase or otherwise retire fixed-rate debt at prices different than carrying value. At December 31, 2022, we had forward starting interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of $295 million designated as cash flow hedges. We utilize cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to interest rate movements by utilizing interest rate swap agreements to hedge variations in cash flows related to the SOFR interest component of future lease payments on our Houston office. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would change the fair values of our cash flow hedges to the following as of December 31, 2022: (In millions) Fair Value at December 31, 2022 Hypothetical Interest Rate Increase of 10% Hypothetical Interest Rate Decrease of 10% Interest rate asset (liability) designated as cash flow hedges $ 24 $ 28 $ 20 Counterparty Risk We are also exposed to financial risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties. If commodity prices fall below certain levels, some of our counterparties may experience liquidity problems and may not be able to meet their financial obligations to us. We review the creditworthiness of counterparties and use master netting agreements when appropriate. 52 Table of Contents
