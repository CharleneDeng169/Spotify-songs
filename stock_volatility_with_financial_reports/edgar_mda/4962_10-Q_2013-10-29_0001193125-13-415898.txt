Basis of Presentation The Company American Express Company (the Company) is a global services company that provides customers with access to products, insights and experiences that enrich lives and build business success. The Company principal products and services are charge and credit payment card products and travel-related services offered to consumers and businesses around the world. The Company also focuses on generating alternative sources of revenue on a global basis in areas such as online and mobile payments and fee-based services. The Company various products and services are sold globally to diverse customer groups, including consumers, small businesses, mid-sized companies and large corporations. These products and services are sold through various channels, including direct mail, online applications, targeted direct and third-party sales forces and direct response advertising. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements incorporated by reference in the Company Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 (the 2012 Form 10-K). The interim consolidated financial information in this report has not been audited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, which consist of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the interim period consolidated financial information, have been made. Results of operations reported for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire year. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. These accounting estimates reflect the best judgment of management, but actual results could differ. Certain reclassifications of prior period amounts have been made to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications did not have a material impact on the Company financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 2. Fair Values Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, based on the Company principal or, in the absence of a principal, most advantageous market for the specific asset or liability. GAAP provides for a three-level hierarchy of inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value, defined as follows: Level 1 Inputs that are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity can access. Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, including: - Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; - Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; - Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and - Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. 6 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Level 3 Inputs that are unobservable and reflect the Company own estimates about the estimates market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances (e.g., internally derived assumptions surrounding the timing and amount of expected cash flows). The Company did not measure any financial instruments presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) during the nine months ended September 30, 2013 or during the year ended December 31, 2012, although the disclosed fair value of certain assets that are not carried at fair value, as presented later in this Note, are classified within Level 3. The Company monitors the market conditions and evaluates the fair value hierarchy levels at least quarterly. For any transfers in and out of the levels of the fair value hierarchy, the Company discloses the fair value measurement at the beginning of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred. Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Carried at Fair Value The following table summarizes the Company financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, categorized by GAAP valuation hierarchy (as described in the preceding paragraphs), as of September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012: 2013 2012 (Millions) Total Level 1 Level 2 Total Level 1 Level 2 Assets: Investment securities: (a) Equity securities $ 168 $ 168 $ $ 296 $ 296 $ Debt securities and other 4,969 232 4,737 5,318 338 4,980 Derivatives (a) 662 662 942 942 Total assets $ 5,799 $ 400 $ 5,399 $ 6,556 $ 634 $ 5,922 Liabilities: Derivatives (a) $ 275 $ $ 275 $ 329 $ $ 329 Total liabilities $ 275 $ $ 275 $ 329 $ $ 329 (a) Refer to Note 5 for the fair values of investment securities and to Note 8 for the fair values of derivative assets and liabilities, on a further disaggregated basis. Valuation Techniques Used in the Fair Value Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Carried at Fair Value For the financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis (categorized in the valuation hierarchy table above) the Company applies the following valuation techniques: Investment Securities When available, quoted prices of identical investment securities in active markets are used to estimate fair value. Such investment securities are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. When quoted prices of identical investment securities in active markets are not available, the fair values for the Company investment securities are obtained primarily from pricing services engaged by the Company, and the Company receives one price for each security. The fair values provided by the pricing services are estimated using pricing models, where the inputs to those models are based on observable market inputs or recent trades of similar securities. Such investment securities are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The inputs to the valuation techniques applied by the pricing services vary depending on the type of security being priced but are typically benchmark yields, benchmark security prices, credit spreads, prepayment speeds, reported trades and broker-dealer quotes, all with reasonable levels of transparency. The pricing services did not apply any adjustments to the 7 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) pricing models used. In addition, the Company did not apply any adjustments to prices received from the pricing services. The Company reaffirms its understanding of the valuation techniques used by its pricing services at least annually. In addition, the Company corroborates the prices provided by its pricing services for reasonableness by comparing the prices from the respective pricing services to valuations obtained from different pricing sources as well as comparing prices to the sale prices received from sold securities at least quarterly. In instances where price discrepancies are identified between different pricing sources, the Company evaluates such discrepancies to ensure that the prices used for its valuation represent the fair value of the underlying investment securities. Refer to Note 5 for additional fair value information. Derivative Financial Instruments The fair value of the Company derivative financial instruments is estimated by third-party valuation services that use proprietary pricing models or by internal pricing models, where the inputs to those models are readily observable from actively quoted markets. The pricing models used are consistently applied and reflect the contractual terms of the derivatives as described below. The Company reaffirms its understanding of the valuation techniques used by the third-party valuation services at least annually. The Company derivative instruments are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the Company interest rate swaps is determined based on a discounted cash flow method using the following significant inputs: the contractual terms of the swap such as the notional amount, fixed coupon rate, floating coupon rate (based on interbank rates consistent with the frequency and currency of the interest cash flows) and tenor, as well as discount rates consistent with the underlying economic factors of the currency in which the cash flows are denominated. The fair value of the Company total return contract, which serves as a hedge against the Hong Kong dollar (HKD) change in fair value associated with the Company investment in the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), is determined based on a discounted cash flow method using the following significant inputs as of the valuation date: number of shares of the Company underlying ICBC investment, the quoted market price of the shares in HKD and the monthly settlement terms of the contract inclusive of price and tenor. The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is determined based on a discounted cash flow method using the following significant inputs: the contractual terms of the forward contracts such as the notional amount, maturity dates and contract rate, as well as relevant foreign currency forward curves, and discount rates consistent with the underlying economic factors of the currency in which the cash flows are denominated. Credit valuation adjustments are necessary when the market parameters, such as a benchmark curve used to value derivatives, are not indicative of the credit quality of the Company or its counterparties. The Company considers the counterparty credit risk by applying an observable forecasted default rate to the current exposure. Refer to Note 8 for additional fair value information. 8 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Carried at Other Than Fair Value The following table discloses the estimated fair value for the Company financial assets and financial liabilities that are not required to be carried at fair value on a recurring basis, as of September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012: Carrying Value Corresponding Fair Value Amount 2013 (Billions) Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Financial Assets: Financial assets for which carrying values equal or approximate fair value Cash and cash equivalents $ 22 $ 22 $ 21 $ 1 (a) $ Other financial assets (b) $ 47 $ 47 $ $ 47 $ Financial assets carried at other than fair value Loans, net $ 62 $ 63 (c) $ $ $ 63 Financial Liabilities: Financial liabilities for which carrying values equal or approximate fair value $ 58 $ 58 $ $ 58 $ Financial liabilities carried at other than fair value Certificates of deposit (d) $ 10 $ 10 $ $ 10 $ Long-term debt $ 52 $ 55 (c) $ $ 55 $ Carrying Value Corresponding Fair Value Amount 2012 (Billions) Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Financial Assets: Financial assets for which carrying values equal or approximate fair value Cash and cash equivalents $ 22 $ 22 $ 21 $ 1 (a) $ Other financial assets (b) $ 47 $ 47 $ $ 47 $ Financial assets carried at other than fair value Loans, net $ 64 $ 65 (c) $ $ $ 65 Financial Liabilities: Financial liabilities for which carrying values equal or approximate fair value $ 55 $ 55 $ $ 55 $ Financial liabilities carried at other than fair value Certificates of deposit (d) $ 10 $ 10 $ $ 10 $ Long-term debt $ 59 $ 62 (c) $ $ 62 $ (a) Reflects time deposits. (b) Includes accounts receivables (including fair values of Card Member receivables of $6.4 billion and $8.0 billion held by consolidated variable interest entities (VIEs) as of September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively), restricted cash and other miscellaneous assets. (c) Includes fair values of loans of $29.2 billion and $32.4 billion, and long-term debt of $15.8 billion and $19.5 billion, held by consolidated VIEs as of September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively. (d) Presented as a component of customer deposits on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 9 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) The fair values of these financial instruments are estimates based upon the market conditions and perceived risks as of September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, and require management judgment. These figures may not be indicative of future fair values. The fair value of the Company cannot be reliably estimated by aggregating the amounts presented. Valuation Techniques Used in the Fair Value Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Carried at Other Than Fair Value For the financial assets and liabilities that are not required to be carried at fair value on a recurring basis (categorized in the valuation hierarchy table above), the Company applies the following valuation techniques to measure fair value: Financial Assets for Which Carrying Values Equal or Approximate Fair Value Financial assets for which carrying values equal or approximate fair value include cash and cash equivalents, Card Member receivables, accrued interest and certain other assets. For these assets, the carrying values approximate fair value because they are short term in duration, have no defined maturity or have a market-based interest rate. Financial Assets Carried at Other Than Fair Value Loans Loans are recorded at historical cost, less reserves, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In estimating the fair value for the Company loans the Company uses a discounted cash flow model. Due to the lack of a comparable whole loan sales market for similar credit card receivables and the lack of observable pricing inputs thereof, the Company uses various inputs derived from an equivalent securitization market to estimate fair value. Such inputs include projected income (inclusive of future interest payments and late fee revenue), estimated pay-down rates, discount rates and relevant credit costs. Financial Liabilities for Which Carrying Values Equal or Approximate Fair Value Financial liabilities for which carrying values equal or approximate fair value include accrued interest, customer deposits (excluding certificates of deposit, which are described further below), Travelers Cheques and other prepaid products outstanding, accounts payable, short-term borrowings and certain other liabilities for which the carrying values approximate fair value because they are short term in duration, have no defined maturity or have a market-based interest rate. Financial Liabilities Carried at Other Than Fair Value Certificates of Deposit Certificates of deposit (CDs) are recorded at their historical issuance cost on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology based on the future cash flows and the discount rate that reflects the Company current rates for similar types of CDs within similar markets. Long-term Debt Long-term debt is recorded at historical issuance cost on the Consolidated Balance Sheets adjusted for the impact of fair value hedge accounting on certain fixed-rate notes and current translation rates for foreign-denominated debt. The fair value of the Company long-term debt is measured using quoted offer prices when quoted market prices are available. If quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is determined by discounting the future cash flows of each instrument at rates currently observed in publicly-traded debt markets for debt of similar terms and credit risk. For long-term debt, where there are no rates currently observable in publicly-traded debt markets of similar terms and comparable credit risk, 10 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) the Company uses market interest rates and adjusts those rates for necessary risks, including its own credit risk. In determining an appropriate spread to reflect its credit standing, the Company considers credit default swap spreads, bond yields of other long-term debt offered by the Company, and interest rates currently offered to the Company for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities. Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements The Company has certain assets that are subject to measurement at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. For these assets, measurement at fair value in periods subsequent to their initial recognition is applicable if determined to be impaired. During the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and during the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company did not have any material assets that were measured at fair value due to impairment. 3. Accounts Receivable and Loans As described below, the Company charge and lending payment card products result in the generation of Card Member receivables and Card Member loans, respectively. Card Member and Other Receivables Card Member receivables, representing amounts due from charge card product customers, are recorded at the time a Card Member enters into a point-of-sale transaction with a merchant. Each charge card transaction is authorized based on its likely economics reflecting a Card Member most recent credit information and spend patterns. Additionally, global spend limits are established to limit the maximum exposure for the Company. Charge card customers generally must pay the full amount billed each month. Card Member receivable balances are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of reserves for losses (refer to Note 4), and include principal and any related accrued fees. Accounts receivable as of September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 consisted of: (Millions) 2013 2012 U.S. Card Services (a) $ 20,258 $ 21,124 International Card Services 7,181 7,778 Global Commercial Services (b) 15,853 13,671 Global Network & Merchant Services (c) 172 193 Card Member receivables (d) 43,464 42,766 Less: Reserve for losses 396 428 Card Member receivables, net $ 43,068 $ 42,338 Other receivables, net (e) $ 3,429 $ 3,576 (a) Includes $6.4 billion and $7.5 billion of gross Card Member receivables available to settle obligations of consolidated VIEs as of September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively. (b) Includes $476 million of gross Card Member receivables available to settle obligations of a consolidated VIE as of December 31, 2012. Also includes $857 million and $913 million due from airlines, of which Delta Air Lines (Delta) comprises $600 million and $676 million as of September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively. (c) Includes receivables primarily related to the Company International Currency Card portfolios. (d) Includes approximately $13.7 billion of Card Member receivables outside the United States for both September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012. (e) Other receivables primarily represent amounts related to (i) purchased joint venture receivables, (ii) certain merchants for billed discount revenue, and (iii) Global Network Services (GNS) partner banks for items such as royalty and franchise fees. Other receivables are presented net of reserves for losses of $77 million and $86 million as of September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively. 11 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Card Member and Other Loans Card Member loans, representing amounts due from lending card product customers, are recorded at the time a Card Member enters into a point-of-sale transaction with a merchant, as well as amounts due from charge card product customers when a Card Member enters into an extended payment arrangement with the Company. The Company lending portfolios primarily include revolving loans to Card Members obtained through either their credit card accounts or the lending on charge feature of their charge card accounts. These loans have a range of terms such as credit limits, interest rates, fees and payment structures, which can be revised over time based on new information about Card Members and in accordance with applicable regulations and the respective product terms and conditions. Card Members holding revolving loans are typically required to make monthly payments based on pre-established amounts. The amounts that Card Members choose to revolve are subject to finance charges. Card Member loans are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of reserves for losses (refer to Note 4), and include principal, accrued interest and fees receivable. The Company policy generally is to cease accruing interest on a Card Member loan at the time the account is written off, and establish reserves for interest that the Company believes will not be collected. Loans as of September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 consisted of: (Millions) 2013 2012 U.S. Card Services (a) $ 54,481 $ 55,953 International Card Services 8,445 9,236 Global Commercial Services 44 40 Card Member loans 62,970 65,229 Less: Reserve for losses 1,281 1,471 Card Member loans, net $ 61,689 $ 63,758 Other loans, net (b) $ 526 $ 551 (a) Includes approximately $29.5 billion and $32.7 billion of gross Card Member loans available to settle obligations of consolidated VIEs as of September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively. (b) Other loans primarily represent loans to merchants and a store card loan portfolio whose billed business is not processed on the Company network. Other loans are presented net of reserves for losses of $16 million and $20 million as of September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively. 12 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Card Member Loans and Card Member Receivables Aging Generally, a Card Member account is considered past due if payment is not received within 30 days after the billing statement date. The following table represents the aging of Card Member loans and receivables as of September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012: 2013 (Millions) Current 30-59 Days Past Due 60-89 Days Past Due 90+ Days Past Due Total Card Member Loans: U.S. Card Services $ 53,892 $ 184 $ 127 $ 278 $ 54,481 International Card Services 8,318 41 28 58 8,445 Card Member Receivables: U.S. Card Services $ 19,915 $ 122 $ 65 $ 156 $ 20,258 International Card Services (a) (b ) (b ) (b ) 80 7,181 Global Commercial Services (a) (b ) (b ) (b ) 120 15,853 2012 (Millions) Current 30-59 Days Past Due 60-89 Days Past Due 90+ Days Past Due Total Card Member Loans: U.S. Card Services $ 55,281 $ 200 $ 147 $ 325 $ 55,953 International Card Services 9,099 47 30 60 9,236 Card Member Receivables: U.S. Card Services $ 20,748 $ 116 $ 76 $ 184 $ 21,124 International Card Services (a) (b ) (b ) (b ) 74 7,778 Global Commercial Services (a) (b ) (b ) (b ) 112 13,671 (a) For Card Member receivables in International Card Services (ICS) and Global Commercial Services (GCS), delinquency data is tracked based on days past billing status rather than days past due. A Card Member account is considered 90 days past billing if payment has not been received within 90 days of the Card Member billing statement date. In addition, if the Company initiates collection procedures on an account prior to the account becoming 90 days past billing the associated Card Member receivable balance is considered as 90 days past billing. These amounts are shown above as 90+ Days Past Due for presentation purposes. (b) Data for periods prior to 90 days past billing are not available due to financial reporting system constraints. Therefore, it has not been relied upon for risk management purposes. The balances that are current to 89 days past due can be derived as the difference between the Total and the 90+ Days Past Due balances. 13 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Credit Quality Indicators for Card Member Loans and Receivables The following tables present the key credit quality indicators as of or for the nine months ended September 30: 2013 2012 Net Write-Off Rate 30 Days Past Due as a % of Total Net Write-Off Rate 30 Days Past Due as a % of Total Principal Only (a) Principal, Interest, & Fees (a) Principal Only (a) Principal, Interest, & Fees (a) Card Member Loans: U.S. Card Services 1.9% 2.1% 1.1% 2.2% 2.4% 1.3% International Card Services 1.9% 2.3% 1.5% 1.9% 2.5% 1.6% Card Member Receivables: U.S. Card Services 1.8% 1.9% 1.7% 2.0% 2.1% 1.8% 2013 2012 Net Loss Ratio as a % of Charge Volume 90 Days Past Billing as a % of Receivables Net Loss Ratio as a % of Charge Volume 90 Days Past Billing as a % of Receivables Card Member Receivables: International Card Services 0.20% 1.1% 0.16% 0.9% Global Commercial Services 0.07% 0.8% 0.07% 0.7% (a) The Company presents a net write-off rate based on principal losses only (i.e., excluding interest and/or fees) to be consistent with industry convention. In addition, because the Company practice is to include uncollectible interest and/or fees as part of its total provision for losses, a net write-off rate including principal, interest and/or fees is also presented. Refer to Note 4 for additional indicators, including external environmental qualitative factors, management considers in its monthly evaluation process for reserves for losses. Impaired Card Member Loans and Receivables Impaired loans and receivables are defined by GAAP as individual larger balance or homogeneous pools of smaller balance restructured loans and receivables for which it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the Card Member agreement. The Company considers impaired loans and receivables to include: (i) loans over 90 days past due still accruing interest, (ii) non-accrual loans, and (iii) loans and receivables modified as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). The Company may modify, through various company sponsored programs, Card Member loans and receivables in instances where the Card Member is experiencing financial difficulty to minimize losses while providing Card Members with temporary or permanent financial relief. The Company has classified Card Member loans and receivables in these modification programs as TDRs. Such modifications to the loans and receivables may include (i) reducing the interest rate (as low as zero percent, in which case the loan is characterized as non-accrual in the Company TDR disclosures), (ii) reducing the outstanding balance (in the event of a settlement), (iii) suspending delinquency fees until the Card Member exits the modification program and (iv) placing the Card Member on a fixed payment plan not to exceed 60 months. Upon entering the modification program, the Card Member ability to make future purchases is either cancelled or in certain cases suspended until the Card Member successfully exits the modification program. In accordance with the modification agreement with the Card Member, loans revert back to the original contractual terms (including the contractual interest rate) when the Card Member exits the modification program, which is either (i) when all payments have been made in accordance with the modification agreement or (ii) when the 14 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Card Member defaults out of the modification program. In either case, the Company establishes a reserve for Card Member interest charges and fees considered to be uncollectible. The performance of a loan or a receivable modified as a TDR is closely monitored to understand its impact on the Company reserve for losses. Though the ultimate success of modification programs remains uncertain, the Company believes the programs improve the cumulative loss performance of such loans and receivables. Reserves for Card Member loans and receivables modified as TDRs are determined as the difference between the cash flows expected to be received from the Card Member (taking into consideration the probability of subsequent defaults), discounted at the original effective interest rates, and the carrying value of the Card Member loan or receivable balance. The Company determines the original effective interest rate as the interest rate in effect prior to the imposition of any penalty interest rate. All changes in the impairment measurement are included in the provision for losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The following table provides additional information with respect to the Company impaired Card Member loans, which are not significant for GCS, and Card Member receivables, which are not significant for ICS and GCS, as of September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012: 2013 (Millions) Loans over 90 Days Past Due & Accruing Interest (a) Non- Accrual Loans (b) Loans & Receivables Modified as a TDR (c) Total Impaired Loans & Receivables Unpaid Principal Balance (d) Allowance for TDRs (e) Card Member Loans: U.S. Card Services $ 125 $ 284 $ 397 $ 806 $ 764 $ 86 International Card Services 57 4 4 65 64 Card Member Receivables: U.S. Card Services 55 55 51 39 Total $ 182 $ 288 $ 456 $ 926 $ 879 $ 125 2012 (Millions) Loans over 90 Days Past Due & Accruing Interest (a) Non- Accrual Loans (b) Loans & Receivables Modified as a TDR (c) Total Impaired Loans & Receivables Unpaid Principal Balance (d) Allowance for TDRs (e) Card Member Loans: U.S. Card Services $ 73 $ 426 $ 627 $ 1,126 $ 1,073 $ 152 International Card Services 59 5 6 70 69 1 Card Member Receivables: U.S. Card Services 117 117 111 91 Total $ 132 $ 431 $ 750 $ 1,313 $ 1,253 $ 244 (a) The Company policy is generally to accrue interest through the date of write-off (at 180 days past due). The Company establishes reserves for interest that the Company believes will not be collected. Excludes loans modified as a TDR. (b) Non-accrual loans not in modification programs include certain Card Member loans placed with outside collection agencies for which the Company has ceased accruing interest. Effective September 1, 2013 the Company began accruing interest on accounts placed with outside agencies. (c) Total loans and receivables modified as a TDR includes $93 million and $320 million that are non-accrual and $20 million and $6 million that are past due 90 days and still accruing interest as of September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively. (d) Unpaid principal balance consists of Card Member charges billed and excludes other amounts charged directly by the Company such as interest and fees. (e) Represents the reserve for losses for TDRs, which are evaluated individually for impairment. The Company records a reserve for losses for all impaired loans.

(b) The difference between the pre- and post-modification outstanding balances is attributable to amounts charged off for Card Member loans and receivables being resolved through the Company short-term settlement programs. As described previously, the Company Card Member loans and receivables modification programs may include (i) reducing the interest rate, (ii) reducing the outstanding balance, (iii) suspending delinquency fees and (iv) placing the Card Member on a fixed payment plan not to exceed 60 months. Upon entering the modification program, the Card Member ability to make future purchases is either cancelled or in certain cases suspended until successfully exiting the modification program. The Company has evaluated the primary financial effects of the impact of the changes to an account upon modification as follows: Interest Rate Reduction: For the three months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, the average interest rate reduction was 10 percentage points and 11 percentage points, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, the average interest rate reduction was 11 percentage points and 12 percentage points, respectively. None of these interest rate reductions had a significant impact on interest on loans in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company does not offer interest rate reduction programs for U.S. Card Services (USCS) Card Member receivables as these receivables are non-interest bearing. Outstanding Balance Reduction: The table above presents the financial effects to the Company as a result of reducing the outstanding balance for short-term settlement programs. The difference between the pre- and post-modification outstanding balances represents the amount that either has been written off or will be written off upon successful completion of the settlement program. Starting in 2013, we began writing off Card Member balances upon entering into a settlement agreement, with any payments 17 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) received thereafter recognized as recoveries, and as such, there is no longer a difference between the pre- and post-modification outstanding balances. This change had a de minimis impact on the amount of write-offs. Payment Term Extension: For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, the average payment term extension was approximately 12 months for USCS Card Member receivables. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, the average payment term extension was approximately 12 months and 13 months, respectively, for USCS Card Member receivables. For USCS Card Member loans, there have been no payment term extensions. The following table provides information for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, with respect to the Card Member loans and receivables modified as TDRs that subsequently defaulted within 12 months of modification. A Card Member will default from a modification program after one and up to two consecutive missed payments, depending on the terms of the modification program. The defaulted ICS Card Member loan and receivable modifications were not significant.

Reserves for Losses Reserves for losses relating to Card Member loans and receivables represent management best estimate of the probable inherent losses in the Company outstanding portfolio of loans and receivables, as of the balance sheet date. Management evaluation process requires certain estimates and judgments. Reserves for losses are primarily based upon statistical models that analyze portfolio performance and reflect management judgment regarding the quantitative components of the reserve. The models take into account several factors, including loss migration rates and average losses and recoveries over an appropriate historical period. Management considers whether to adjust the models for specific qualitative factors such as increased risk in certain portfolios, impact of risk management initiatives on portfolio performance and concentration of credit risk based on factors such as vintage, industry or geographic regions. In addition, 18 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) management may increase or decrease the reserves for losses on Card Member loans for other external environmental qualitative factors, including various indicators related to employment, spend, sentiment, housing and credit, as well as the legal and regulatory environment. Generally, due to the short-term nature of Card Member receivables, the impact of additional external qualitative factors on the probable losses inherent within the Card Member receivables portfolio is not significant. As part of this evaluation process, management also considers various reserve coverage metrics, such as reserves as a percentage of past due amounts, reserves as a percentage of Card Member receivables or loans and net write-off coverage. Card Member loans and receivables balances are written off when management considers amounts to be uncollectible, which is generally determined by the number of days past due and is typically no later than 180 days past due. Card Member loans and receivables in bankruptcy or owed by deceased individuals are generally written off upon notification and recoveries are recognized as they are collected.

Investment Securities Investment securities include debt and equity securities classified as available for sale. The Company investment securities, principally debt securities, are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with unrealized gains (losses) recorded in AOCI, net of income taxes. Realized gains and losses are recognized in results of operations upon disposition of the securities using the specific identification method on a trade date basis. Refer to Note 2 for a description of the Company methodology for determining the fair value of investment securities.

Overall, for the investment securities in gross unrealized loss positions identified above, (i) the Company does not intend to sell the investment securities, (ii) it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the investment securities before recovery of the unrealized losses, and (iii) the Company expects that the contractual principal and interest will be received on the investment securities. As a result, the Company recognized no other-than-temporary impairment during the nine months ended September 30, 2013 or the year ended December 31, 2012. Supplemental Information Gross realized gains on the sales of investment securities, included in other non-interest revenues, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013 were $37 million and $102 million, respectively. Gross realized gains on the sales of investment securities, included in other non-interest revenues, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012 were $35 million and $85 million, respectively. There were no gross realized losses on sales of investment securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013. Gross realized losses on sales of investment securities, included in other non-interest revenues, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012 were nil and $1 million, respectively. Contractual maturities of investment securities, excluding equity securities and other securities, as of September 30, 2013 were as follows: (Millions) Cost Estimated Fair Value Due within 1 year $ 571 $ 571 Due after 1 year but within 5 years 337 345 Due after 5 years but within 10 years 159 166 Due after 10 years 3,838 3,839 Total $ 4,905 $ 4,921 The expected payments on state and municipal obligations and mortgage-backed securities may not coincide with their contractual maturities because the issuers have the right to call or prepay certain obligations. 22 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 6. Asset Securitizations The Company periodically securitizes Card Member receivables and loans arising from its card business through the transfer of those assets to securitization trusts. The trusts then issue securities to third-party investors, collateralized by the transferred assets. Card Member receivables are transferred to the American Express Issuance Trust II (the Charge Trust II) 1 . Card Member loans are transferred to the American Express Credit Account Master Trust (the Lending Trust). The Charge Trust II and the Lending Trust are consolidated by American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. (TRS), which is a consolidated subsidiary of the Company. The trusts are considered VIEs as they have insufficient equity at risk to finance their activities, which are to issue securities that are collateralized by the underlying Card Member receivables and loans. TRS, in its role as servicer of the Charge Trust II and the Lending Trust, has the power to direct the most significant activity of the trusts, which is the collection of the underlying Card Member receivables and loans in the trusts. In addition, TRS, excluding its consolidated subsidiaries, owns approximately $0.7 billion of subordinated securities issued by the Lending Trust as of September 30, 2013. These subordinated securities have the obligation to absorb losses of the Lending Trust and provide the right to receive benefits from the Lending Trust, both of which are significant to the VIE. TRS role as servicer for the Charge Trust II does not provide it with a significant obligation to absorb losses or a significant right to receive benefits. However, TRS position as the parent company of the entities that transferred the receivables to the Charge Trust II makes it the party most closely related to the Charge Trust II. Based on these considerations, TRS is the primary beneficiary of both the Charge Trust II and the Lending Trust. The debt securities issued by the Charge Trust II and the Lending Trust are non-recourse to the Company. Securitized Card Member receivables and loans held by the Charge Trust II and the Lending Trust are available only for payment of the debt securities or other obligations issued or arising in the securitization transactions. The long-term debt of each trust is payable only out of collections on their respective underlying securitized assets. There was a de minimis amount and approximately $3 million of restricted cash held by the Charge Trusts as of September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively, and approximately $162 million and $73 million of restricted cash held by the Lending Trust as of September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively, included in other assets on the Company Consolidated Balance Sheets. These amounts relate to collections of Card Member receivables and loans to be used by the trusts to fund future expenses and obligations, including interest paid on investor certificates, credit losses and upcoming debt maturities. Under the respective terms of the Charge Trust II and the Lending Trust agreements, the occurrence of certain triggering events associated with the performance of the assets of each trust could result in payment of trust expenses, establishment of reserve funds, or in a worst-case scenario, early amortization of investor certificates. During the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and the year ended December 31, 2012, no such triggering events occurred. 1 During the third quarter of 2013, the Company transferred Card Member receivables from the American Express Issuance Trust (the Charge Trust) to the Charge Trust II, collectively referred to as the Charge Trusts. As of September 30, 2013, the Charge Trust was dissolved, and the Company will utilize the Charge Trust II for securitization of Card Member receivables. 23 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 7.

Derivatives and Hedging Activities The Company uses derivative financial instruments (derivatives) to manage exposures to various market risks. Derivatives derive their value from an underlying variable or multiple variables, including interest rate, foreign exchange, and equity index or price. These instruments enable end users to increase, reduce or alter exposure to various market risks and, for that reason, are an integral component of the Company market risk management. The Company does not engage in derivatives for trading purposes. Market risk is the risk to earnings or value resulting from movements in market prices. The Company market risk exposure is primarily generated by: Interest rate risk in its card, insurance and Travelers Cheque businesses, as well as its investment portfolios; and Foreign exchange risk in its operations outside the United States and the associated funding of such operations. The Company centrally monitors market risks using market risk limits and escalation triggers as defined in its Asset/Liability Management Policy. The Company market exposures are in large part byproducts of the delivery of its products and services. Interest rate risk arises through the funding of Card Member receivables and fixed-rate loans with variable-rate borrowings as well as through the risk to net interest margin from changes in the relationship between benchmark rates such as Prime and LIBOR. Interest rate exposure within the Company charge card and fixed-rate lending products is managed by varying the proportion of total funding provided by short-term and variable-rate debt and deposits compared to fixed-rate debt and deposits. In addition, interest rate swaps are used from time to time to economically convert fixed-rate debt obligations to variable-rate obligations or to convert variable-rate debt obligations to fixed-rate obligations. The Company may change the mix between variable-rate and fixed-rate funding based on changes in business volumes and mix, among other factors. Foreign exchange risk is generated by Card Member cross-currency charges, foreign currency balance sheet exposures, foreign subsidiary equity and foreign currency earnings in entities outside the United States. The Company foreign exchange risk is managed primarily by entering into agreements to buy and sell currencies on a spot basis or by hedging this market exposure to the extent it is economically justified through various means, including the use of derivatives such as foreign exchange forwards and cross-currency swap contracts, which can help mitigate the Company exposure to specific currencies. In addition to the exposures identified above, effective August 1, 2011, the Company entered into a total return contract (TRC) to hedge its exposure to changes in the fair value of its equity investment in ICBC in local currency. Under the terms of the TRC, the Company receives from the TRC counterparty an amount equivalent to any reduction in the fair value of its investment in ICBC in local currency, and the Company pays to the TRC counterparty an amount equivalent to any increase in the fair value of its investment in local currency, along with all dividends paid by ICBC, as well as ongoing hedge costs. The TRC matures on August 1, 2014. Derivatives may give rise to counterparty credit risk, which is the risk that a derivative counterparty will default on, or otherwise be unable to perform pursuant to, an uncollateralized derivative exposure. The Company manages this risk by considering the current exposure, which is the replacement cost of contracts on the measurement date, as well as estimating the maximum potential value of the contracts over the next 12 months, considering such factors as the volatility of the underlying or reference index. To mitigate derivative credit risk, counterparties are required to be pre-approved by the Company and rated as investment grade. Counterparty risk exposures are centrally monitored by the Company. Additionally, in order to mitigate the bilateral counterparty 25 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) credit risk associated with derivatives, the Company has in certain instances entered into master netting agreements with its derivative counterparties, which provide a right of offset for certain exposures between the parties. A significant portion of the Company derivative assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 is subject to such master netting agreements with its derivative counterparties. There are no instances where management makes an accounting policy election to not net assets and liabilities subject to an enforceable master netting agreement on the Company Consolidated Balance Sheets. To further mitigate bilateral counterparty credit risk, the Company exercises its rights under executed credit support agreements with certain of its derivative counterparties. These agreements require that, in the event the fair value change in the net derivatives position between the two parties exceeds certain dollar thresholds, the party in the net liability position posts collateral to its counterparty. All derivative contracts cleared through a central clearinghouse are collateralized to the full amount of the fair value of the contracts. In relation to the Company credit risk, under the terms of the derivative agreements it has with its various counterparties, the Company is not required to either immediately settle any outstanding liability balances or post collateral upon the occurrence of a specified credit risk-related event. Based on the assessment of credit risk of the Company derivative counterparties as of September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, the Company does not have derivative positions that warrant credit valuation adjustments. The Company derivatives are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The accounting for changes in fair value depends on the instruments intended use and the resulting hedge designation, if any, as discussed below. Refer to Note 2 for a description of the Company methodology for determining the fair value of derivatives. 26 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) The following table summarizes the total fair value, excluding interest accruals, of derivative assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012: Other Assets Fair Value Other Liabilities Fair Value (Millions) 2013 2012 2013 2012 Derivatives designated as hedging instruments: Interest rate contracts Fair value hedges $ 517 $ 824 $ $ Total return contract Fair value hedge 6 19 Foreign exchange contracts Net investment hedges 49 43 164 150 Total derivatives designated as hedging instruments $ 566 $ 867 $ 170 $ 169 Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Interest rate contracts $ $ $ $ Foreign exchange contracts, including certain embedded derivatives (a) 96 75 105 158 Equity-linked embedded derivative (b) 2 Total derivatives not designated as hedging instruments 96 75 105 160 Total derivatives, gross $ 662 $ 942 $ 275 $ 329 Cash collateral netting (c) (380 ) (326 ) (14 ) (21) Derivative asset and derivative liability netting (d) (27 ) (23 ) (27 ) (23) Total derivatives, net (e) $ 255 $ 593 $ 234 $ 285 (a) Includes foreign currency derivatives embedded in certain operating agreements. (b) Represents an equity-linked derivative embedded in one of the Company investment securities. (c) Represents the offsetting of derivative instruments and the right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable) arising from derivative instrument(s) executed with the same counterparty under an enforceable master netting arrangement. Additionally, the Company received noncash collateral in the form of security interest in U.S. Treasury securities with a fair value of nil and $335 million as of September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively, none of which was sold or repledged. Such noncash collateral effectively further reduces the Company risk exposure to $255 million and $258 million as of September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively, but does not reduce the net exposure on the Company Consolidated Balance Sheets. Additionally, the Company posted $33 million and nil as of September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively, as initial margin on its centrally cleared interest rate swaps not netted against the derivative balances. (d) Represents the amount of netting of derivative assets and derivative liabilities executed with the same counterparty under an enforceable master netting arrangement. (e) The Company has no individually significant derivative counterparties and therefore, no significant risk exposure to any single derivative counterparty. The total net derivative assets and derivative liabilities are presented within other assets and other liabilities on the Company Consolidated Balance Sheets. Derivative Financial Instruments that Qualify for Hedge Accounting Derivatives executed for hedge accounting purposes are documented and designated as such when the Company enters into the contracts. In accordance with its risk management policies, the Company structures its hedges with terms similar to that of the item being hedged. The Company formally assesses, at inception of the hedge accounting relationship and on a quarterly basis, whether derivatives designated as hedges are highly effective in offsetting the fair value or cash flows of the hedged items. These assessments usually are made through the application of a regression analysis method. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge, the Company will discontinue the application of hedge accounting. Fair Value Hedges A fair value hedge involves a derivative designated to hedge the Company exposure to future changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability, or an identified portion thereof that is attributable to a particular risk. Interest Rate Contracts The Company is exposed to interest rate risk associated with its fixed-rate long-term debt. The Company uses interest rate swaps to economically convert certain fixed-rate long-term debt obligations to floating-rate obligations at the time of issuance. As of September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, the Company hedged $14.7 billion and $18.4 billion, respectively, of its fixed-rate debt to floating-rate debt using interest rate swaps. 27 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) To the extent the fair value hedge is effective, the gain or loss on the hedging instrument offsets the loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. Any difference between the changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item is referred to as hedge ineffectiveness and is reflected in earnings as a component of other expenses. Hedge ineffectiveness may be caused by differences between the debt interest coupon and the benchmark rate, primarily due to credit spreads at inception of the hedging relationship that are not reflected in the valuation of the interest rate swap. Furthermore, hedge ineffectiveness may be caused by changes in the relationship between 3-month LIBOR and 1-month LIBOR, as well as between the overnight indexed swap (OIS) and 1-month LIBOR, as basis spreads may impact the valuation of the interest rate swap without causing an offsetting impact in the value of the hedged debt. If a fair value hedge is de-designated or no longer considered to be effective, changes in fair value of the derivative continue to be recorded through earnings but the hedged asset or liability is no longer adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates. The existing basis adjustment of the hedged asset or liability is amortized or accreted as an adjustment to yield over the remaining life of that asset or liability. Total Return Contract The Company hedges its exposure to changes in the fair value of its equity investment in ICBC in local currency. The Company uses a TRC to transfer this exposure to its derivative counterparty. As of September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, the fair value of the equity investment in ICBC was $167 million (239.5 million shares) and $295 million (415.9 million shares), respectively. To the extent the hedge is effective, the gain or loss on the TRC offsets the loss or gain on the investment in ICBC. Any difference between the changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item results in hedge ineffectiveness and is recognized in other expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The following table summarizes the impact on the Consolidated Statements of Income associated with the Company hedges of its fixed-rate long-term debt and its investment in ICBC for the three and nine months ended September 30: For the Three Months Ended September 30: (Millions) Gains (losses) recognized in income Derivative contract Hedged item Net hedge ineffectiveness Derivative relationship Income Statement Line Item Amount Income Statement Line Item Amount 2013 2012 2013 2012 2013 2012 Interest rate contracts Other, net expenses $ (11 ) $ (28 ) Other, net expenses $ 5 $ (2 ) $ (6 ) $ (30) Total return contract Other non-interest revenues (21 ) (19 ) Other non-interest revenues 21 19 For the Nine Months Ended September 30: (Millions) Gains (losses) recognized in income Derivative contract Hedged item Net hedge ineffectiveness Derivative relationship Income Statement Line Item Amount Income Statement Line Item Amount 2013 2012 2013 2012 2013 2012 Interest rate contracts Other, net expenses $ (305 ) $ (64 ) Other, net expenses $ 295 $ 25 $ (10 ) $ (39) Total return contract Other non-interest revenues (10 ) 2 Other non-interest revenues 10 (2 ) The Company also recognized a net reduction in interest expense on long-term debt of $76 million and $127 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, primarily related to the net settlements (interest accruals) on the Company interest rate derivatives designated as fair value hedges. For the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, the impact on interest expense was a net reduction in interest expense on long-term debt of $280 million and $377 million, respectively. 28 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Cash Flow Hedges A cash flow hedge involves a derivative designated to hedge the Company exposure to variable future cash flows attributable to a particular risk. Such exposures may relate to either an existing recognized asset or liability or a forecasted transaction. The Company hedges existing long-term variable-rate debt, the rollover of short-term borrowings and the anticipated forecasted issuance of additional funding through the use of derivatives, primarily interest rate swaps. These derivative instruments economically convert floating-rate debt obligations to fixed-rate obligations for the duration of the instrument. As of September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, the Company did not hedge any of its floating-rate debt using interest rate swaps. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivatives is recorded in AOCI and reclassified into earnings when the hedged cash flows are recognized in earnings. The amount that is reclassified into earnings is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the same line item in which the hedged instrument or transaction is recognized, primarily in interest expense. Any ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivatives is reported as a component of other expenses. If a cash flow hedge is de-designated or terminated prior to maturity, the amount previously recorded in AOCI is recognized into earnings over the period that the hedged item impacts earnings. If a hedge relationship is discontinued because it is probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur according to the original strategy, any related amounts previously recorded in AOCI are recognized into earnings immediately. No ineffectiveness or other amounts were reclassified from AOCI into income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013 and the three months ended September 30, 2012. For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, an amount of $(1) million loss was reclassified from AOCI into income. In the normal course of business, as the hedged cash flows are recognized into earnings, the Company does not expect to reclassify any amount of net pretax losses on derivatives from AOCI into earnings during the next 12 months. Net Investment Hedges A net investment hedge is used to hedge future changes in currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation. The Company primarily designates foreign currency derivatives, typically foreign exchange forwards, and on occasion foreign currency denominated debt, as hedges of net investments in certain foreign operations. These instruments reduce exposure to changes in currency exchange rates on the Company investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. The effective portion of the gain or (loss) on net investment hedges, net of taxes, recorded in AOCI as part of the cumulative translation adjustment was $(123) million and $(320) million for the three months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and was $160 million and $(294) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Any ineffective portion of the gain or (loss) on net investment hedges is recognized in other expenses during the period of change. No ineffectiveness or other amounts were reclassified from AOCI into income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012. Derivatives Not Designated as Hedges The Company has derivatives that act as economic hedges, but are not designated as such for hedge accounting purposes. Foreign currency transactions and non-U.S. dollar cash flow exposures from time to time may be partially or fully economically hedged through foreign currency contracts, primarily foreign exchange forwards, options and cross-currency swaps. These hedges generally mature within one year. Foreign currency contracts involve the purchase and sale of a designated currency at an agreed upon rate for settlement on a specified date. The changes in the fair value of the derivatives effectively offset the related foreign exchange gains or losses on the underlying balance sheet exposures. From time to time, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps to specifically manage funding costs related to its proprietary card business. 29 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) The Company has certain operating agreements containing payments that may be linked to a market rate or price, primarily foreign currency rates. The payment components of these agreements may meet the definition of an embedded derivative, in which case the embedded derivative is accounted for separately and is classified as a foreign exchange contract based on its primary risk exposure. In addition, the Company holds an investment security containing an embedded equity-linked derivative. For derivatives that are not designated as hedges, changes in fair value are reported in current period earnings. The following table summarizes the impact on pretax earnings of derivatives not designated as hedges, as reported on the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and nine months ended September 30: For the Three Months Ended September 30: (Millions) Pretax gains (losses) Amount Description Income Statement Line Item 2013 2012 Interest rate contracts Other, net expenses $ 1 $ (1) Foreign exchange contracts (a) Other, net expenses 25 (13) Equity-linked contract Other non-interest revenues Total $ 26 $ (14) For the Nine Months Ended September 30: (Millions) Pretax gains (losses) Amount Description Income Statement Line Item 2013 2012 Interest rate contracts Other, net expenses $ 1 $ (2) Foreign exchange contracts (a) Other, net expenses 106 31 Equity-linked contract Other non-interest revenues 2 2 Total $ 109 $ 31 (a) Foreign exchange contracts include embedded foreign currency derivatives. Gains (losses) on these embedded derivatives are included in other expenses. 9. Guarantees The Company provides Card Member protection plans that cover losses associated with purchased products, as well as certain other guarantees in the ordinary course of business which are within the scope of GAAP governing the accounting for guarantees. In relation to its maximum potential undiscounted future payments as shown in the table that follows, to date the Company has not experienced any significant losses related to guarantees. The Company initial recognition of guarantees is at fair value, which has been determined in accordance with GAAP governing fair value measurement. In addition, the Company establishes reserves when a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. 30 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) The following table provides information related to such guarantees as of September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012: Maximum potential undiscounted future payments (a) (Billions) Related liability (b) (Millions) Type of Guarantee 2013 2012 2013 2012 Card and travel operations (c) $ 44 $ 44 $ 87 $ 93 Other (d) 1 1 74 93 Total $ 45 $ 45 $ 161 $ 186 (a) Represents the notional amounts that could be lost under the guarantees and indemnifications if there were a total default by the guaranteed parties. The Merchant Protection guarantee is calculated using management best estimate of maximum exposure based on all eligible claims as measured against annual billed business volumes. The Company mitigates this risk by withholding settlement from the merchant or obtaining deposits and other guarantees from merchants considered higher risk due to various factors. The amounts being held by the Company are not significant when compared to the maximum potential undiscounted future payments. (b) Included as part of other liabilities on the Company Consolidated Balance Sheets. (c) Primarily includes Merchant Protection and Return Protection. (d) Primarily includes guarantees related to the Company business dispositions and real estate. 10. Changes In Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income AOCI is a balance sheet item in the Shareholders Equity section of the Company Consolidated Balance Sheets. It is comprised of items that have not been recognized in earnings but may be recognized in earnings in the future when certain events occur. Changes in each component of AOCI for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012 were as follows: For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2013 (Millions) , net of tax Net Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Investment Securities Net Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Cash Flow Hedges Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments Net Unrealized Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Losses Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income Balances as of June 30, 2013 $ 153 $ $ (1,027 ) $ (434 ) $ (1,308) Net unrealized (losses) (25 ) (25) Reclassification for realized (gains) into earnings (23 ) (23) Net translation of investments in foreign operations 134 134 Net losses related to hedges of investment in foreign operations (123 ) (123) Pension and other postretirement benefit losses 6 6 Net change in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income (48 ) 11 6 (31) Balances as of September 30, 2013 $ 105 $ $ (1,016 ) $ (428 ) $ (1,339) For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2013 (Millions) , net of tax Net Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Investment Securities Net Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Cash Flow Hedges Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments Net Unrealized Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Losses Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income Balances as of December 31, 2012 $ 315 $ $ (754 ) $ (488 ) $ (927) Net unrealized (losses) (141 ) (141) Reclassification for realized (gains) into earnings (69 ) (69) Net translation of investments in foreign operations (422 ) (422) Net losses related to hedges of investment in foreign operations 160 160 Pension and other postretirement benefit losses 60 60 Net change in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income (210 ) (262 ) 60 (412) Balances as of September 30, 2013 $ 105 $ $ (1,016 ) $ (428 ) $ (1,339) 31 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2012 (Millions) , net of tax Net Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Investment Securities Net Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Cash Flow Hedges Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments Net Unrealized Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Losses Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income Balances as of June 30, 2012 $ 319 $ $ (809 ) $ (461 ) $ (951) Net unrealized gains 43 43 Reclassification for realized (gains) into earnings (22 ) (22) Net translation of investments in foreign operations 401 401 Net losses related to hedges of investment in foreign operations (320 ) (320) Pension and other postretirement benefit losses 14 14 Net change in accumulated other comprehensive income 21 81 14 116 Balances as of September 30, 2012 $ 340 $ $ (728 ) $ (447 ) $ (835) For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2012 (Millions) , net of tax Net Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Investment Securities Net Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Cash Flow Hedges Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments Net Unrealized Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Losses Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income Balances as of December 31, 2011 $ 288 $ (1 ) $ (682 ) $ (481 ) $ (876) Net unrealized gains 108 108 Reclassification for realized (gains) losses into earnings (56 ) 1 (55) Net translation of investments in foreign operations 248 248 Net losses related to hedges of investment in foreign operations (294 ) (294) Pension and other postretirement benefit losses 34 34 Net change in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income 52 1 (46 ) 34 41 Balances as of September 30, 2012 $ 340 $ $ (728 ) $ (447 ) $ (835) The following table presents the effects of reclassifications out of AOCI and into the Consolidated Statement of Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013: For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2013 (Millions) Description Income Statement Line Item Amount Net gain in AOCI reclassifications for previously unrealized net gains on investment securities Other non-interest revenues $ (36) Related income tax expense Income tax provision 13 Total $ (23) For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2013 (Millions) Description Income Statement Line Item Amount Net gain in AOCI reclassifications for previously unrealized net gains on investment securities Other non-interest revenues $ (109) Related income tax expense Income tax provision 40 Total $ (69) 11. Income Taxes The Company is under continuous examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and tax authorities in other countries and states in which the Company has significant business operations. The tax years under examination and open for examination vary by jurisdiction. The IRS has completed its field examination of the Company federal tax returns for years through 2007; however, refund claims for certain years continue to be reviewed by the IRS. In addition, the Company is currently under examination by the IRS for the years 2008 through 2011. 32 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) The Company believes it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits could decrease within the next 12 months by as much as $736 million principally as a result of potential resolutions of prior years tax items with various taxing authorities. The prior years tax items include unrecognized tax benefits relating to the deductibility of certain expenses or losses and the attribution of taxable income to a particular jurisdiction or jurisdictions. Of the $736 million of unrecognized tax benefits, approximately $532 million relates to amounts that if recognized would be recorded to shareholders equity and would not impact the effective tax rate. In addition, approximately $59 million relates to amounts that if recognized would not impact the effective tax rate as they relate to temporary differences. With respect to the remaining $145 million, it is not possible to quantify the impact that the decrease could have on the effective tax rate and net income due to the inherent complexities and the number of tax years open for examination in multiple jurisdictions. Resolution of the prior years items that comprise this remaining amount could have an impact on the effective tax rate and on net income, either favorably (principally as a result of settlements that are less than the liability for unrecognized tax benefits) or unfavorably (if such settlements exceed the liability for unrecognized tax benefits). The effective tax rate was 31.8 percent and 31.4 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, respectively, and 33.2 percent and 30.4 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, respectively. The tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013 reflects the benefit of the reversal of a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets associated with certain of the Company non-U.S. business travel operations, as well as the resolution of certain prior years tax items. Based on management intent to reorganize its business travel operations through the creation of a joint venture, it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be sufficient to support the realization of the benefit of the associated non-U.S. deferred tax assets. The tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 reflects the realization of certain foreign tax credits. The tax rates for all periods reflect the level of pretax income in relation to a generally consistent level of recurring permanent tax benefits and geographic mix of business. 33 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 12. Earnings Per Common Share (EPS) The computations of basic and diluted EPS were as follows: Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (Millions, except per share amounts) 2013 2012 2013 2012 Numerator: Basic and diluted: Net income $ 1,366 $ 1,250 $ 4,051 $ 3,845 Earnings allocated to participating share awards (a) (12 ) (14 ) (36 ) (42) Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 1,354 $ 1,236 $ 4,015 $ 3,803 Denominator: (a) Basic: Weighted-average common stock 1,074 1,126 1,087 1,143 Add: Weighted-average stock options (b) 7 6 7 6 Diluted 1,081 1,132 1,094 1,149 Basic EPS: $ 1.26 $ 1.10 $ 3.69 $ 3.33 Diluted EPS: $ 1.25 $ 1.09 $ 3.67 $ 3.31 (a) The Company unvested restricted stock awards, which include the right to receive non-forfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents, are considered participating securities. Calculations of EPS under the two-class method exclude from the numerator any dividends paid or owed on participating securities and any undistributed earnings considered to be attributable to participating securities. The related participating securities are similarly excluded from the denominator. (b) For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, the dilutive effect of unexercised stock options excludes 0.1 million and 0.2 million of options, respectively, from the computation of EPS because inclusion of the options would have been anti-dilutive. For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, the dilutive effect of unexercised stock options excludes 8 million options from the computation of EPS because inclusion of the options would have been anti-dilutive. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, the Company met specified performance measures related to the Subordinated Debentures of $750 million issued in 2006, which resulted in no impact to EPS. If the performance measures were not achieved in any given quarter, the Company would be required to issue common shares and apply the proceeds to make interest payments. 13.

Contingencies The Company and its subsidiaries are involved in a number of legal proceedings concerning matters arising out of the conduct of their respective business activities and are periodically subject to governmental and regulatory examinations, information gathering requests, subpoenas, inquiries and investigations (collectively, governmental examinations). As of September 30, 2013, the Company and various of its subsidiaries were named as a defendant or were otherwise involved in numerous legal proceedings and governmental examinations in various jurisdictions, both in and outside the United States. The Company discloses its material legal proceedings and governmental examinations under Item 1. Legal Proceedings in Part II. Other Information , and under Legal Proceedings in the 2012 Form 10-K (collectively, Legal Proceedings). The Company has recorded liabilities for certain of its outstanding legal proceedings and governmental examinations. A liability is accrued when it is both (a) probable that a loss has occurred and (b) the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. As discussed below, there may be instances in which an exposure to loss exceeds the accrued liability. The Company evaluates, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings and governmental examinations that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the liability that has been previously accrued or a revision to the disclosed estimated range of possible losses, as applicable. The Company legal proceedings range from cases brought by a single plaintiff to class actions with millions of putative class members. These legal proceedings, as well as governmental examinations, involve various lines of business of the Company and a variety of claims (including, but not limited to, common law tort, contract, antitrust and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel factual allegations and/or unique legal theories. While some matters pending against the Company specify the damages claimed by the plaintiff, many seek a not-yet-quantified amount of damages or are at very early stages of the legal process. Even when the amount of damages claimed against the Company are stated, the claimed amount may be exaggerated and/or unsupported. As a result, some matters have not yet progressed sufficiently through discovery and/or development of important factual information and legal issues to enable the Company to estimate a range of possible loss. Other matters have progressed sufficiently through discovery and/or development of important factual information and legal issues so that the Company is able to estimate a range of possible loss. Accordingly, for those legal proceedings and governmental examinations disclosed or referred to in Legal Proceedings where a loss is reasonably possible in future periods, whether in excess of a related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, and for which the Company is able to estimate a range of possible loss, the current estimated range is zero to $510 million in excess of any accrued liability related to these matters. This aggregate range represents management estimate of possible loss with respect to these matters and is based on currently available information. This estimated range of possible loss does not represent the Company maximum loss exposure. The legal proceedings and governmental examinations underlying the estimated range will change from time to time and actual results may vary significantly from current estimates. Based on its current knowledge, and taking into consideration its litigation-related liabilities, the Company believes it is not a party to, nor are any of its properties the subject of, any pending legal proceeding or governmental examination that would have a material adverse effect on the Company consolidated financial condition or liquidity. However, in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters, the ultimate outcome of a particular matter could be material to the Company operating results for a particular period depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of the Company earnings for that period. 36 Table of Contents AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 15.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Business Introduction American Express Company (the Company) is a global services company that provides customers with access to products, insights and experiences that enrich lives and build business success. The Company principal products and services are charge and credit payment card products and travel-related services offered to consumers and businesses around the world. The Company range of products and services include: charge and credit card products; expense management products and services; consumer and business travel services; stored-value products such as Travelers Cheques and other prepaid products; network services; merchant acquisition and processing, servicing and settlement, and point-of-sale, marketing and information products and services for merchants; and fee services, including fraud prevention services and the design of customized customer loyalty and rewards programs. The Company products and services are sold globally to diverse customer groups, including consumers, small businesses, mid-sized companies and large corporations. These products and services are sold through various channels, including direct mail, online applications, in-house and third-party sales forces and direct response advertising. The Company competes in the global payments industry with charge, credit and debit card networks, issuers and acquirers, as well as evolving alternative payment mechanisms, systems and products. As the payments industry continues to evolve, the Company is facing increasing competition from non-traditional players, such as online networks, telecom providers and software-as-a-service providers, that leverage new technologies and customers existing charge and credit card accounts and bank relationships to create payment or other fee-based solutions. The Company is transforming its existing businesses and creating new products and services for the digital marketplace as the Company seeks to increase its share of online spend, enhance customers digital experiences and develop platforms for online and mobile commerce. Emerging technologies also provide an opportunity to deliver financial products and services that help new customer segments move and manage their money, which we are pursuing through our Enterprise Growth Group. The Company products and services generate the following types of revenue for the Company: Discount revenue, which is the Company largest revenue source, represents fees generally charged to merchants when Card Members use their cards to purchase goods and services at merchants on the Company network; Net card fees, which represent revenue earned for annual card membership fees; Travel commissions and fees, which are earned by charging a transaction or management fee to both customers and suppliers for travel-related transactions; Other commissions and fees, which are earned on foreign exchange conversions and card-related fees and assessments; Other revenue, which represents insurance premiums earned from Card Member travel and other insurance programs, revenues arising from contracts with partners of our Global Network Services 38 Table of Contents (GNS) business (including royalties and signing fees), publishing revenues and other miscellaneous revenue and fees; and Interest on loans, which principally represents interest income earned on outstanding balances. In addition to funding and operating costs associated with these types of revenue, other major expense categories are related to marketing and reward programs that add new Card Members and promote Card Member loyalty and spending, and provisions for Card Member credit and fraud losses. Financial Targets The Company seeks to achieve three financial targets, on average and over time: Revenues net of interest expense growth of at least 8 percent; Earnings per share (EPS) growth of 12 to 15 percent; and Return on average equity (ROE) of 25 percent or more. If the Company achieves its EPS and ROE targets, it will seek to return on average and over time approximately 50 percent of the capital it generates to shareholders as dividends or through the repurchases of common stock, which may be subject to certain regulatory restrictions as described herein. Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures Certain of the statements in this Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Refer to the Forward-Looking Statements section below. In addition, certain information included within this Form 10-Q constitute non-GAAP financial measures. The Company calculations of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the calculations of similarly titled measures by other companies. Bank Holding Company The Company is a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and the Federal Reserve Board (Federal Reserve) is the Company primary federal regulator. As such, the Company is subject to the Federal Reserve regulations, policies and minimum capital standards. Current Economic Environment/Outlook The Company results for the third quarter of 2013 reflect continued healthy spending growth, excellent credit quality and a strong capital position. During the quarter, Card Member spending volumes grew both in the United States and internationally, and across all of the Company businesses. The Company also saw its average loans continue to grow modestly year over year, which, along with a higher net yield and a lower cost of funds, led to a 9 percent increase in net interest income. At the same time, lending loss rates remain at historically low levels. While the Company expects lending loss rates will eventually increase from such levels, the Company has not yet seen overall credit deterioration, as total delinquency rates remained consistent with the prior quarter. The Company continues to invest in growth opportunities in the United States and internationally, with total expenses increasing 5 percent over the prior year. For the third quarter of 2013, marketing and promotion expense grew by 8 percent as compared to the prior year. Operating expenses increased 4 percent as compared to the year ago period, reflecting investments in technology made during the current quarter, as well as costs associated with the planned business travel joint venture discussed below and the announced sale of American Express Publishing. The Company aim is to have operating expenses grow at an annual rate of less than 3 percent in 2013 and 2014, with the 2012 operating expenses, excluding the restructuring 39 Table of Contents charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2012, as the base. For the nine months ended September 30, 2013, operating expenses are flat as compared to the same period in the prior year. As discussed below within Certain Legislative, Regulatory and Other Developments, the regulatory environment continues to evolve and has heightened the focus that all financial companies, including the Company, must have on their controls and processes. The review of products and practices will be a continuing focus of the Company, as well as by regulators. In addition, regulation of the payments industry has increased significantly in recent years and governments in several countries have established or are proposing to establish network regulatory regimes. Competition remains extremely intense across the Company businesses. In addition, the global economic environment remains uneven. While the Company business is diversified, including the corporate card business, a large international business and GNS partners around the world, any impact of potential U.S. income tax law changes and continued budget and debt ceiling discussions in Washington remains uncertain. On September 25, 2013, the Company announced plans to create a new joint venture for its Global Business Travel (GBT) operations. It is expected that GBT operations, business relationships and other assets would be held and operated by the joint venture entity. As presently contemplated, the Company would maintain a 50 percent ownership stake in the joint venture, while an investor group would own the remaining 50 percent interest. The transaction remains subject to the execution of definitive agreements and receipt of regulatory and other approvals and would be expected to close in the second quarter of 2014.

Average fee per card is computed based on net card fees, including the amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs divided by average worldwide proprietary cards-in-force. The adjusted average fee per card, which is a non-GAAP measure, is computed in the same manner, but excludes amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs. The amount of amortization excluded was $67 million and $65 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and $198 million and $194 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Company presents adjusted average fee per card because the Company believes this metric presents a useful indicator of card fee pricing across a range of its proprietary card products. 40 Table of Contents American Express Company Selected Statistical Information (continued) As of or for the Three Months Ended September 30, As of or for the Nine Months Ended September 30, (Millions, except percentages and where indicated) 2013 2012 Change 2013 2012 Change Worldwide Card Member receivables: Total receivables (billions) $ 43.5 $ 42.3 3 % $ 43.5 $ 42.3 3 % Loss reserves: Beginning balance $ 386 $ 392 (2)% $ 428 $ 438 (2)% Provisions (a) 158 151 5 % 472 434 9 % Other additions (b) 36 39 (8)% 118 97 22 % Net write-offs (c) (149 ) (141 ) 6 % (507 ) (487 ) 4 % Other deductions (d) (35 ) (32 ) 9 % (115 ) (73 ) 58 % Ending balance $ 396 $ 409 (3)% $ 396 $ 409 (3)% % of receivables 0.9 % 1.0 % 0.9 % 1.0 % Net write-off rate principal only USCS (e) 1.4 % 1.6 % 1.8 % 2.0 % Net write-off rate principal and fees USCS (e) 1.6 % 1.7 % 1.9 % 2.1 % 30 days past due as a % of total USCS 1.7 % 1.8 % 1.7 % 1.8 % Net loss ratio as a % of charge volume ICS/GCS 0.11 % 0.10 % 0.12 % 0.10 % 90 days past billing as a % of total ICS/GCS 0.9 % 0.7 % 0.9 % 0.7 % Worldwide Card Member loans: Total loans (billions) $ 63.0 $ 61.8 2 % $ 63.0 $ 61.8 2 % Loss reserves: Beginning balance $ 1,342 $ 1,547 (13)% $ 1,471 $ 1,874 (22)% Provisions (a) 247 231 7 % 824 669 23 % Other additions (b) 35 33 6 % 97 84 15 % Net write-offs principal only (c) (275 ) (292 ) (6)% (888 ) (970 ) (8)% Net write-offs interest and fees (c) (36 ) (36 ) % (113 ) (121 ) (7)% Other deductions (d) (32 ) (24 ) 33 % (110 ) (77 ) 43 % Ending balance $ 1,281 $ 1,459 (12)% $ 1,281 $ 1,459 (12)% Ending reserves principal only $ 1,234 $ 1,411 (13)% $ 1,234 $ 1,411 (13)% Ending reserves interest and fees $ 47 $ 48 (2)% $ 47 $ 48 (2)% % of loans 2.0 % 2.4 % 2.0 % 2.4 % % of past due 179 % 182 % 179 % 182 % Average loans (billions) $ 63.0 $ 61.4 3 % $ 62.8 $ 61.0 3 % Net write-off rate principal only (e) 1.7 % 1.9 % 1.9 % 2.1 % Net write-off rate principal, interest and fees (e) 2.0 % 2.1 % 2.1 % 2.4 % 30 days past due as a % of total 1.1 % 1.3 % 1.1 % 1.3 % Net interest income divided by average loans (f) 8.1 % 7.7 % 7.9 % 7.5 % Net interest yield on Card Member loans (f) 9.4 % 9.3 % 9.3 % 9.2 % 41 Table of Contents American Express Company Selected Statistical Information (continued) (a) Provisions for principal (resulting from authorized transactions), interest and fee reserve components on Card Member loans and principal (resulting from authorized transactions) and fee reserve component from Card Member receivables.

For Card Member loans, includes net write-offs for unauthorized transactions of $(34) million and $(31) million for the three months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively; foreign currency translation adjustments of $3 million and $10 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively; and other adjustments of $(1) million and $(3) million for the three months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the components of other deductions for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012. (e) The Company presents a net write-off rate based on principal losses only (i.e., excluding interest and/or fees) to be consistent with industry convention. In addition, because the Company practice is to include uncollectible interest and/or fees as part of its total provision for losses, a net write-off rate including principal, interest and/or fees is also presented. (f) Refer to the following table for the calculation of net interest yield on Card Member loans, a non-GAAP measure, net interest income divided by average loans, a GAAP measure, and the Company rationale for presenting net interest yield on Card Member loans. Calculation of Net Interest Yield on Card Member Loans Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (Millions, except percentages and where indicated) 2013 2012 2013 2012 Net interest income $ 1,283 $ 1,181 $ 3,728 $ 3,435 Exclude: Interest expense not attributable to the Company Card Member loan portfolio 296 338 902 1,043 Interest income not attributable to the Company Card Member loan portfolio (87 ) (97 ) (270 ) (310) Adjusted net interest income (a) $ 1,492 $ 1,422 $ 4,360 $ 4,168 Average loans (billions) $ 63.0 $ 61.4 $ 62.8 $ 61.0 Exclude: Unamortized deferred card fees, net of direct acquisition costs of Card Member loans, and other (billions) (0.2 ) (0.2 ) (0.3 ) (0.2) Adjusted average loans (billions) (a) $ 62.8 $ 61.2 $ 62.5 $ 60.8 Net interest income divided by average loans 8.1 % 7.7 % 7.9 % 7.5% Net interest yield on Card Member loans (a) 9.4 % 9.3 % 9.3 % 9.2% (a) Net interest yield on Card Member loans, adjusted net interest income, and adjusted average loans are non-GAAP measures. Refer to Glossary of Selected Terminology for the definitions of these terms. The Company believes adjusted net interest income and adjusted average loans are useful to investors because they are components of net interest yield on Card Member loans, which provides a measure of profitability of the Company Card Member loan portfolio. Consolidated Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2013 and 2012 The Company consolidated net income for the three months ended September 30, 2013 increased $116 million or 9 percent and diluted EPS increased $0.16 or 15 percent, as compared to the same period in the prior year. The Company total revenues net of interest expense increased 6 percent, total expenses increased 5 percent and total provisions for losses increased 3 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2013, as compared to the same period in the prior year. 42 Table of Contents Total Revenues Net of Interest Expense Consolidated total revenues net of interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2013 increased $439 million or 6 percent, as compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting increases of 6 percent in both U.S. Card Services (USCS) and Global Commercial Services (GCS), 5 percent in Global Network and Merchant Services (GNMS), and 3 percent in International Card Services (ICS). The increase in total revenues net of interest expense primarily reflects higher discount revenue, increased interest and fees on loans, and lower interest expense. Discount revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2013 increased $234 million or 5 percent, as compared to the same period in the prior year, as a result of 7 percent growth in billed business volumes, partially offset by a decrease in the average discount rate and faster growth in GNS billings than overall Company billings. The average discount rate was 2.52 percent and 2.53 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. As indicated in prior quarters, over time, changes in the mix of spending by location and industry, volume-related pricing discounts, strategic investments, certain pricing initiatives, and other factors will likely result in some erosion of the average discount rate. U.S. billed business and billed business outside the United States increased 8 percent and 7 percent, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2013, as compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in billed business in the United States and outside the United States reflects an increase in average spending per proprietary basic card and an increase in basic cards-in-force. 43 Table of Contents The table below summarizes selected statistics for billed business and average spend during the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year. 2013 Percentage Increase (Decrease) Percentage Increase Assuming No Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates (a) Worldwide (b) Billed business 7 % 9% Proprietary billed business 6 7 GNS billed business (c) 12 16 Airline-related volume (9% of worldwide billed business) 4 5 United States (b) Billed business 8 Proprietary consumer card billed business (d) 7 Proprietary small business billed business (d) 10 Proprietary corporate services billed business (e) 8 T&E-related volume (26% of U.S. billed business) 6 Non-T&E-related volume (74% of U.S. billed business) 8 Airline-related volume (8% of U.S. billed business) 5 Outside the United States (b) Billed business 7 11 Japan, Asia Pacific & Australia (JAPA) billed business 4 14 Latin America & Canada (LACC) billed business 7 12 Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA) billed business 10 8 Proprietary consumer and small business billed business (f) 2 7 JAPA billed business (6 ) 7 LACC billed business 4 7 EMEA billed business 9 6 Proprietary corporate services billed business (e) 4 7 (a) The foreign currency adjusted information assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into U.S. dollars (i.e., assumes the foreign exchange rates used to determine results for the three or nine months ended September 30, 2013 apply to the period(s) against which such results are being compared).

Business travel sales increased 3 percent while U.S. consumer travel sales declined 9 percent. Other commissions and fees increased $29 million or 5 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2013, as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by slightly higher late fees and an increase in revenue from the Company Loyalty Partner business. Other revenues increased $24 million or 4 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2013, as compared to the same period in the prior year, driven in part by higher GNS revenues and a $36 million gain on the sale of investment securities in the third quarter of 2013 versus a $30 million gain in the third quarter of 2012. Interest income increased $28 million or 2 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2013, as compared to the same period in the prior year. Interest on loans increased $40 million or 2 percent, driven by a 3 percent increase in average Card Member loans. Interest and dividends on investment securities decreased $12 million or 20 percent, primarily reflecting decreased levels of investment securities. Interest expense decreased $74 million or 13 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2013, as compared to the same period in the prior year. Interest on deposits decreased $7 million or 6 percent, primarily due to a lower effective cost of funds, partially offset by an increase in average customer deposit balances. Interest on long-term debt and other decreased $67 million or 15 percent, reflecting lower effective cost of funds and average long-term debt balances. Provisions for Losses Provisions for losses for the three months ended September 30, 2013 increased $13 million or 3 percent, as compared to the same period in the prior year. Charge card provisions for losses increased $4 million or 2 percent, due to higher receivable balances in the third quarter of 2013 across all portfolios. Card Member loan provisions for losses increased $18 million or 7 percent, primarily reflecting increased volumes and lower reserve releases of $27 million, partially offset by the benefit of lower net write-offs during the third quarter of 2013 due to improved credit performance. Other provisions for losses decreased $9 million or 36 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2013. Expenses Consolidated expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2013 increased $292 million or 5 percent, as compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase primarily reflects higher Card Member rewards expense due to higher spend volumes on co-brand and Membership Rewards products, professional services and marketing and promotion expenses. Marketing and promotion expense increased $63 million or 8 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2013, as compared to the same period in the prior year, including higher spending on Card Member acquisition marketing and brand advertising. Card Member rewards expense increased $123 million or 8 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2013, as compared to the same period in the prior year, due to an increase in co-brand rewards expense of $97 million and an increase in Membership Rewards expense of $26 million. These increases reflect higher co-brand and Membership Rewards-related spending volumes in 2013 and changes in the Membership Rewards ultimate redemption rate (URR) and weighted average cost per point (WAC) assumption. For the three months ended September 30, 2013, Membership Rewards expense included an increase of approximately $47 million from an increase in the URR and WAC assumption. For the three months ended September 30, 2012, Membership Rewards expense included an increase of approximately $38 million from an increase in the URR assumption, net of a decrease in the WAC assumption. The Company URR for program participants was 94 percent (rounded down) and 93 percent (rounded down) for the three months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The increases in the URR are 45 Table of Contents a result of Card Members increased engagement with the Company Membership Rewards program and enhancements made to the U.S. URR estimation process implemented in the fourth quarter of 2012. Card Member services expense decreased $5 million or 2 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2013, as compared to the same period in the prior year. Salaries and employee benefits expense increased $28 million or 2 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2013, as compared to the same period in the prior year, remaining well controlled and reflecting some of the benefits of the restructuring plan announced in January 2013. Other, net for the three months ended September 30, 2013 increased $82 million or 5 percent, as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher professional service expenses driven by higher technology development-related expenses, and costs associated with the planned business travel joint venture and the sale of American Express Publishing. The increase was partially offset by lower expenses related to hedging the Company fixed-rate debt exposures versus the prior year. Income Taxes The effective tax rate was 31.8 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2013, as compared to 33.2 percent for the same period in the prior year. The tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2013, primarily reflects the benefit of the reversal of a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets associated with certain of the Company non-U.S. business travel operations. Consolidated Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2013 and 2012 The Company consolidated net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 increased $206 million or 5 percent and diluted EPS increased $0.36 or 11 percent, as compared to the same period in the prior year. The Company total revenues net of interest expense, total provisions for losses and total expenses increased by approximately 4 percent, 17 percent and 2 percent, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2013, as compared to the same period in the prior year. Total Revenues Net of Interest Expense Consolidated total revenues net of interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 increased $1.0 billion or 4 percent, as compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting increases of 5 percent in both USCS and GNMS and 2 percent in both GCS and ICS. The increase in total revenues net of interest expense primarily reflects higher discount revenue, interest and fees on loans, and net card fees, as well as lower interest expense. Discount revenue increased $662 million or 5 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2013, as compared to the same period in the prior year, as a result of a 7 percent increase in worldwide billed business, partially offset by faster growth in GNS billings than overall Company billings, higher contra-revenue items, including cash rebate awards, and a slight decline in the average discount rate. The average discount rate was 2.52 percent and 2.53 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. U.S. billed business and billed business outside the United States increased 8 percent and 6 percent, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2013, as compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting increases in average spending per proprietary basic card and basic cards-in-force. 46 Table of Contents The table below summarizes selected statistics for billed business and average spend during the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year: 2013 Percentage Increase (Decrease) Percentage Increase Assuming No Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates (a) Worldwide (b) Billed business 7 % 8% Proprietary billed business 6 7 GNS billed business (c) 12 15 Airline-related volume (10% of worldwide billed business) 2 3 United States (b) Billed business 8 Proprietary consumer card billed business (d) 7 Proprietary small business billed business (d) 10 Proprietary corporate services billed business (e) 7 T&E-related volume (27% of U.S. billed business) 5 Non-T&E-related volume (73% of U.S. billed business) 8 Airline-related volume (9% of U.S. billed business) 3 Outside the United States (b) Billed business 6 9 JAPA billed business 6 12 LACC billed business 7 10 EMEA billed business 6 6 Proprietary consumer and small business billed business (f) 2 6 JAPA billed business (4 ) 5 LACC billed business 5 7 EMEA billed business 6 5 Proprietary corporate services billed business (e) 1 3 (a) Refer to the Consolidated Selected Statistical Information footnote (a) on page 44 relating to changes in foreign exchange rates.

Other revenues decreased $76 million or 4 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2013, as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily reflecting a benefit in the first half of 2012 due to revised estimates of the liability for uncashed Travelers Cheques in certain international markets, partially offset by a larger gain on the sale of investment securities in 2013. Interest income increased $106 million or 2 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2013, as compared to the same period in the prior year. Interest on loans increased $152 million or 3 percent, primarily reflecting higher average Card Member loans. Interest and dividends on investment securities decreased $40 million or 21 percent, primarily due to lower average investment securities. Interest expense decreased $187 million or 11 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2013, as compared to the same period in the prior year. Interest on deposits decreased $30 million or 8 percent, as a result of lower effective cost of funds, partially offset by an increase in average customer deposit balances. Interest on long-term debt and other decreased $157 million or 12 percent, reflecting a lower effective cost of funds and lower average long-term debt balances. Provisions for Losses Provisions for losses increased $230 million or 17 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2013, as compared to the same period in the prior year. Charge card provisions for losses increased $59 million or 11 percent due to higher net write-offs and higher fraud provision. Card Member loan provisions for losses increased $168 million or 22 percent, primarily driven by lower reserve releases of $225 million as compared to the same period in the prior year, partially offset by the benefit of lower net write-offs in 2013 due to improved credit performance. Other provisions for losses increased $3 million or 4 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2013. Expenses Consolidated expenses increased $397 million or 2 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2013, as compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase primarily reflects higher Card Member rewards expenses. Marketing and promotion expense increased $66 million or 3 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2013, as compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting increased spend on Card Member acquisition marketing and brand advertising. Card Member rewards expense increased $315 million or 7 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2013, as compared to the same period in the prior year, due to an increase in co-brand rewards expense of $243 million and an increase in Membership Rewards expense of $72 million. These increases reflect higher co-brand and Membership Rewards-related spending volumes in 2013 and changes in the URR and WAC assumption. Card Member services expense increased $4 million or 1 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2013, as compared to the same period in the prior year. Salaries and employee benefits expense increased $15 million or less than 1 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2013, as compared to the same period in the prior year, remaining well controlled and reflecting some of the benefits of the restructuring plan announced in January 2013. Other, net decreased $3 million or less than 1 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2013, as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily reflecting higher Card Member reimbursements and investment impairments in the prior year, partially offset by higher professional services expenses in the current year driven by increased technology development and other investments in the business. 48 Table of Contents Income Taxes The effective tax rate was 31.4 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2013, as compared to 30.4 percent for the same period in the prior year. The tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 reflects the benefit of the reversal of a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets associated with certain of the Company non-U.S. business travel operations, as well as the resolution of certain prior years tax items. The tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 reflects the realization of certain foreign tax credits. Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity The Company balance sheet management objectives are to maintain: A solid and flexible equity capital profile; A broad, deep and diverse set of funding sources to finance its assets and meet operating requirements; and Liquidity programs that enable the Company to continuously meet expected future financing obligations and business requirements for at least a 12-month period, even in the event it is unable to continue to raise new funds under its traditional funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions. Capital Strategy The Company objective is to retain sufficient levels of capital generated through earnings and other sources to maintain a solid equity capital base and to provide flexibility to support future business growth. The Company believes capital allocated to growing businesses with a return on risk-adjusted equity in excess of its costs will generate shareholder value. The level and composition of the Company consolidated capital position are determined through the Company internal capital adequacy assessment process, which reflects its business activities, as well as marketplace conditions and requirements or expectations of credit rating agencies, regulators and shareholders, among others. The Company consolidated capital position is also influenced by subsidiary capital requirements. The Company, as a bank holding company, is also subject to regulatory requirements administered by the U.S. federal banking agencies. The Federal Reserve has established specific capital adequacy guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items. The Company currently calculates and reports its capital ratios under the standards commonly referred to as Basel I. In June 2004, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (commonly referred to as Basel) published new international guidelines for determining regulatory capital (Basel II). In December 2007, the U.S. bank regulatory agencies jointly adopted a final rule based on Basel II. The Company has adopted Basel II in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions and is currently taking steps toward Basel II implementation in the United States. The Company expects to enter parallel run status on January 1, 2014. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) and a series of international capital and liquidity standards published by Basel on December 16, 2010 further changed the current quantitative measures. In general, these changes involve, for the U.S. banking industry as a whole, a reduction in the types of instruments deemed to be capital along with an increase in the amount of capital that assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items require. These changes will generally serve to reduce reported capital ratios compared to current capital guidelines. On July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve approved a final regulatory capital rule, which provides for new U.S. regulatory capital standards, known as Basel III. The U.S. rules are generally in line with the aforementioned capital standards published by Basel in 2010. The Company has adopted Basel III in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions and is currently taking steps toward Basel III advanced approach implementation in the United States. 49 Table of Contents The following table presents the regulatory risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratio for the Company and its significant bank subsidiaries, as well as additional ratios widely utilized in the marketplace, as of September 30, 2013. Well- Capitalized Ratios (a) Ratios as of September 30, 2013 Risk-Based Capital Tier 1 6 % American Express Company 12.8% American Express Centurion Bank 20.7% American Express Bank, FSB 16.6% Total 10 % American Express Company 14.7% American Express Centurion Bank 22.0% American Express Bank, FSB 18.8% Tier 1 Leverage 5 % American Express Company 10.7% American Express Centurion Bank 18.3% American Express Bank, FSB 17.3% Common Equity to Risk-Weighted Assets American Express Company 15.6% Tier 1 Common Risk-Based (b) American Express Company 12.8% Tangible Common Equity to Risk-Weighted Assets (b) American Express Company 12.3% (a) As defined by the Federal Reserve. (b) Refer to page 51 for a reconciliation of Tier 1 common equity and tangible common equity, both non-GAAP measures. The following provides definitions for the Company regulatory risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratio, which are calculated as per standard regulatory guidance, if applicable: Risk-Weighted Assets Assets are weighted for risk according to a formula used by the Federal Reserve to conform to capital adequacy guidelines. On and off-balance sheet items are weighted for risk, with off-balance sheet items converted to balance sheet equivalents, using risk conversion factors, before being allocated a risk-adjusted weight. The off-balance sheet items comprise a minimal part of the overall calculation. Risk-weighted assets as of September 30, 2013 were $123.2 billion. Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio The Tier 1 capital ratio is calculated as Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 capital is the sum of common shareholders equity, certain perpetual preferred stock (not applicable to the Company), and noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries, adjusted for ineligible goodwill and intangible assets, as well as certain other comprehensive income items as follows: net unrealized gains/losses on securities and derivatives, and net unrealized pension and other postretirement benefit losses, all net of tax. Tier 1 capital as of September 30, 2013 was $15.8 billion. This ratio is commonly used by regulatory agencies to assess a financial institution financial strength and is the primary form of capital used to absorb losses beyond current loss accrual estimates. Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio The total risk-based capital ratio is calculated as the sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 2 capital is the sum of the allowance for receivable and loan losses (limited to 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets) and 45 percent of the unrealized gains on equity securities, plus a $750 million subordinated hybrid security, for which the Company received approval from the Federal Reserve for treatment as Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital as of September 30, 2013 was $2.3 billion. The $750 million subordinated hybrid security is not expected to meet the requirements of Tier 2 capital under Basel III. See Basel III below. 50 Table of Contents Tier 1 Leverage Ratio The Tier 1 leverage ratio is calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by the Company average total consolidated assets for the most recent quarter. Average total consolidated assets as of September 30, 2013 were $147.1 billion. The following provides definitions for capital ratios widely used in the marketplace, although they may be calculated differently by different companies: Tier 1 Common Risk-Based Capital Ratio The Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio is calculated as Tier 1 common equity, a non-GAAP measure, divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 common equity is calculated by reference to total shareholders equity as shown below: (Billions) September 30, 2013 Total shareholders equity $ 19.2 Net effect of certain items in accumulated other comprehensive loss excluded from Tier 1 common equity 0.3 Less: Ineligible goodwill and intangible assets (3.5) Less: Ineligible deferred tax assets (0.2) Total Tier 1 common equity $ 15.8 The Company believes the Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio is useful because it can be used to assess and compare the quality and composition of the Company capital with the capital of other financial services companies. Moreover, Basel III includes measures that rely on the Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio. Common Equity and Tangible Common Equity to Risk-Weighted Assets Ratios Common equity equals the Company shareholders equity of $19.2 billion as of September 30, 2013, and tangible common equity, a non-GAAP measure, equals common equity less goodwill and other intangibles of $4.0 billion as of September 30, 2013. The Company believes presenting the ratio of tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets is a useful measure of evaluating the strength of the Company capital position. The Company seeks to maintain capital levels and ratios in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements; failure to maintain minimum capital levels could affect the Company status as a financial holding company and cause the respective regulatory agencies to take actions that could limit the Company business operations. The Company primary source of equity capital has been the generation of net income. Historically, capital generated through net income and other sources, such as the exercise of stock options by employees, has exceeded the annual growth in its capital requirements. To the extent capital has exceeded business, regulatory and rating agency requirements, the Company has historically returned excess capital to shareholders through its regular common share dividend and share repurchase program. The Company maintains certain flexibility to shift capital across its businesses as appropriate. For example, the Company may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements. These infused amounts can affect the capital profile and liquidity levels at the American Express parent company level. The Company does not currently intend or foresee a need to shift capital from non-U.S. subsidiaries with permanently reinvested earnings to a U.S. parent company. Basel III Basel III, when fully phased-in, will require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital than prior requirements, with a greater emphasis on common equity. The Company estimates that had Basel III been fully phased in during the third quarter of 2013, the reported 51 Table of Contents Tier 1 risk-based capital and Tier 1 common risk-based ratios would have been 12.5 percent, the reported Tier 1 leverage ratio would have been 10.5 percent and the supplementary leverage ratio would have been 8.9 percent. 4 These ratios are calculated using the standardized approach as described in the final rules without taking into account the potential impact of Basel III advanced approach implementation. As noted above, the Company is currently taking steps toward Basel III advanced approach implementation in the United States. The Company $750 million subordinated hybrid security, which is presently included in Tier 2 capital, is not expected to meet the requirements of Tier 2 capital under Basel III. The Tier 1 ratios set forth in this paragraph are not impacted by the treatment of the hybrid security. The following provides definitions for capital ratios as defined by Basel III using the standardized approach. All calculations are non-GAAP measures. Basel III Tier 1 Common Risk-Based Capital Ratio The Basel III Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio is calculated as adjusted Tier 1 common equity divided by adjusted risk-weighted assets. Basel III Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio The Basel III Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is calculated as adjusted Tier 1 capital divided by adjusted risk-weighted assets. The following table presents a comparison of the Company Tier 1 and Tier 1 common risk-based capital under Basel I to its estimated Tier 1 and Tier 1 common risk-based capital under Basel III. (Billions) September 30, 2013 Risk-Based Capital under Basel I $ 15.8 Adjustments related to: AOCI for available for sale securities 0.1 Pension and other post-retirement benefit costs (0.4) Estimated Risk-Based Capital under Basel III (a) $ 15.5 (a) Estimated Basel III Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 common equity reflects the Company current interpretation of Basel III. The estimated Basel III Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 common equity could change if the Company business changes; and the estimated impact for the third quarter of 2013 is not necessarily indicative of the impact in future periods. Basel III Risk-Weighted Assets The Basel III risk-weighted assets reflect the Company Basel I risk-weighted assets, adjusted for the impact of the incremental risk weighting applied to deferred tax assets and significant investments in unconsolidated financial institutions, as well as exposures to past due accounts, equities and sovereigns. Basel III risk-weighted assets as of September 30, 2013 were estimated to be $124.2 billion. Basel III Tier 1 Leverage Ratio The Basel III Tier 1 leverage ratio is calculated by dividing Basel III Tier 1 capital by the Company average total consolidated assets. Basel III Supplementary Leverage Ratio The Basel III supplementary leverage ratio is calculated by dividing Basel III Tier 1 capital by the Company total assets for leverage capital purposes under Basel III. Total assets for leverage capital purposes includes adjustments for Tier 1 capital deductions, off-balance sheet derivatives, undrawn unconditionally cancellable commitments and other off-balance sheet liabilities. Total assets for leverage capital purposes as of September 30, 2013 were $174.6 billion. 4 The capital ratios are non-GAAP measures. The Company believes the presentation of the capital ratios is helpful to investors by showing the impact of Basel III. 52 Table of Contents Share Repurchases and Dividends The Company has a share repurchase program to return excess capital to shareholders. The share repurchases reduce shares outstanding and offset, in whole or part, the issuance of new shares as part of employee compensation plans. During the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2013, the Company returned $1.2 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively, to its shareholders in the form of dividends ($0.2 billion and $0.7 billion, respectively) and share repurchases ($1.0 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively). The Company repurchased 13 million common shares at an average price of $74.73 in the third quarter of 2013. These dividend and share repurchase amounts represent approximately 86 percent and 85 percent of total capital generated during the three and nine month periods, respectively. The Company is executing its share repurchase program, subject to market conditions and pursuant to its capital plan, which includes up to $0.8 billion in share repurchases for the remainder of 2013. Funding Strategy The Company principal funding objective is to maintain broad and well-diversified funding sources to allow it to meet its maturing obligations, cost-effectively finance current and future asset growth in its global businesses as well as to maintain a strong liquidity profile. The diversity of funding sources by type of debt instrument, by maturity and by investor base, among other factors, provides additional insulation from the impact of disruptions in any one type of debt, maturity or investor. The mix of the Company funding in any period will seek to achieve cost efficiency consistent with both maintaining diversified sources and achieving its liquidity objectives. The Company funding strategy and activities are integrated into its asset-liability management activities. The Company has in place a funding policy covering American Express Company and all of its subsidiaries. The Company proprietary card businesses are the primary asset-generating businesses, with significant assets in both domestic and international Card Member receivable and lending activities. The Company financing needs are in large part a consequence of its proprietary card-issuing businesses and the maintenance of a liquidity position to support all of its business activities, such as merchant payments. The Company generally pays merchants for card transactions prior to reimbursement by Card Members and therefore funds the merchant payments during the period Card Member loans and receivables are outstanding. The Company also has additional financing needs associated with general corporate purposes, including acquisition activities. The Company seeks to raise funds to meet all of its financing needs, including seasonal and other working capital needs, while also seeking to maintain sufficient cash and readily marketable securities that are easily convertible to cash, in order to meet the scheduled maturities of all long-term funding obligations on a consolidated basis for a 12-month period. Management does not currently expect to make any significant changes to the Company funding programs or liquidity strategy in order to satisfy Basel III liquidity coverage ratio standard based upon its current understanding of the proposed requirements. During the third quarter of 2013, the Company issued (i) $1.1 billion of asset-backed securities from American Express Credit Account Master Trust (the Lending Trust) with a maturity of five years, which included $1.0 billion of Class A certificates at 1-month LIBOR plus 42 basis points and $53.6 million of Class B certificates at 1-month LIBOR plus 70 basis points, (ii) $3.0 billion of multi-tranche senior unsecured notes from American Express Credit Corporation consisting of $1.2 billion of three year floating rate notes at a rate of 3-month LIBOR plus 51 basis points, $1.0 billion of three year fixed-rate notes with a coupon of 1.3 percent and $800 million of five year fixed-rate notes with a coupon of 2.125 percent, and (iii) $731 million of asset-backed securities from American Express Issuance Trust II (the Charge Trust II) with a maturity of five years, consisting of $700 million of Class A notes at 1-month LIBOR plus 43 basis points and $31 million of Class B notes at 1-month LIBOR plus 70 basis points. The Company equity capital and funding strategies are designed, among other things, to maintain appropriate and stable unsecured debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies: Moody Investor 53 Table of Contents Services (Moody s), Standard & Poor (S&P), Fitch Ratings (Fitch) and Dominion Bond Rating Services (DBRS). Such ratings help support the Company access to cost-effective unsecured funding as part of its overall funding strategy. The Company asset-backed securitization (ABS) activities are rated separately. Unsecured Debt Ratings Credit Agency Entity Rated Short-Term Ratings Long-Term Ratings Outlook DBRS All rated entities R-1 (middle) A (high) Stable Fitch All rated entities F1 A+ Stable Moody TRS (a) and rated operating subsidiaries Prime-1 A2 Stable Moody American Express Company Prime-2 A3 Stable S&P TRS (b) and rated operating subsidiaries A-2 A- Stable S&P American Express Company A-2 BBB+ Stable (a) American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. (b) S&P does not provide a rating for TRS short-term debt. Downgrades in the ratings of the Company unsecured debt or asset securitization program securities could result in higher funding costs, as well as higher fees related to borrowings under its unused lines of credit. Declines in credit ratings could also reduce the Company borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets. The Company believes the change in its funding mix, which now includes a higher proportion of U.S. retail deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on the Company funding capacity and costs. Downgrades to certain of the Company unsecured debt ratings in the last several years have not materially impacted the Company borrowing costs or resulted in a reduction in its borrowing capacity. Deposit Programs The Company offers deposits within its American Express Centurion Bank and American Express Bank, FSB (FSB) subsidiaries (together, the Banks). These funds are currently insured up to $250,000 per account holder through the FDIC. The Company ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates is dependent on the Banks capital levels. The Company, through the FSB, has a direct retail deposit program, Personal Savings from American Express, to supplement its distribution of deposit products sourced through third-party distribution channels. The direct retail program makes FDIC-insured certificates of deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings account products available directly to consumers. 54 Table of Contents The Company held the following deposits as of: (Billions) September 30, 2013 December 31, 2012 U.S. retail deposits: Savings accounts Direct $ 23.6 $ 18.7 Certificates of deposit: (a) Direct 0.7 0.7 Third-party 8.9 8.9 Sweep accounts Third-party 8.8 11.4 Other retail deposits: Non-U.S. deposits and U.S. non-interest bearing 0.1 0.1 Card Member credit balances - U.S. and non-U.S. (b) 0.4 Total customer deposits $ 42.5 $ 39.8 (a) The weighted average remaining maturity and weighted average rate at issuance on the total portfolio of U.S. retail CDs, issued through direct and third-party programs, were 20.1 months and 2.0 percent, respectively, as of September 30, 2013. (b) Beginning the first quarter 2013, the Company reclassified prospectively Card Member credit balances from Card Member loans, Card Member receivables and Other liabilities to Customer deposits. Asset Securitization Programs The Company periodically securitizes Card Member receivables and loans arising from its card business, as the securitization market provides the Company with cost-effective funding. Securitization of Card Member receivables and loans is accomplished through the transfer of those assets to a trust, which in turn issues to third-party investors certificates or notes (securities) collateralized by the transferred assets. The proceeds from issuance are distributed to the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, as consideration for the transferred assets. The receivables and loans being securitized are reported as assets on the Company Consolidated Balance Sheets and the related securities issued to third-party investors are reported as long-term debt. Under the respective terms of the securitization trust agreements, the occurrence of certain triggering events associated with the performance of the assets of each trust could result in payment of trust expenses, establishment of reserve funds, or in a worst-case scenario, early amortization of investor certificates. During the nine months ended September 30, 2013, no such triggering events occurred. During the third quarter 2013, the Company transferred Card Member receivables from the American Express Issuance Trust (Charge Trust) to the Charge Trust II. As of September 30, 2013, the Charge Trust was dissolved. The Company will continue to utilize the Charge Trust II for securitization of Card Member receivables. Liquidity Management The Company liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of cash, readily marketable securities and contingent sources of liquidity, so that the Company can continuously meet expected future financing obligations and business requirements for at least a 12-month period, even in the event it is unable to raise new funds under its regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions. The Company has in place a liquidity risk policy that sets out the Company approach to managing liquidity risk on an enterprise-wide basis. The Company incurs and accepts liquidity risk arising in the normal course of offering its products and services. The liquidity risks that the Company is exposed to can arise from a variety of sources, and thus its liquidity management strategy includes a variety of parameters, assessments and guidelines, including, but not limited to: Maintaining a diversified set of funding sources (refer to Funding Strategy section for more details); Maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and off-balance sheet liquidity sources; and 55 Table of Contents Projecting cash inflows and outflows from a variety of sources and under a variety of scenarios, including contingent liquidity exposures such as unused Card Member lines of credit and collateral requirements for derivative transactions. The Company current liquidity target is to have adequate liquidity in the form of excess cash and readily marketable securities that are easily convertible into cash to satisfy all maturing long-term funding obligations for a 12-month period. In addition to its cash and readily marketable securities, the Company maintains a variety of contingent liquidity resources, such as access to undrawn amounts under its secured financing facilities and committed bank credit facilities as well as the Federal Reserve discount window. As of September 30, 2013, the Company had $16.4 billion in excess cash available to fund long-term maturities, which includes $22.3 billion classified as cash and cash equivalents and $0.1 billion restricted cash to fund asset-backed securitization maturities, less $6.0 billion of cash available to fund day-to-day operations. The $16.4 billion represents cash residing in the United States. The upcoming approximate maturities of the Company long-term unsecured debt, debt issued in connection with asset-backed securitizations and long-term certificates of deposit are as follows: (Billions) Debt Maturities Quarter Ending: Unsecured Debt Asset-Backed Securitizations Certificates of Deposit Total December 31, 2013 $ $ 1.2 $ 2.6 $ 3.8 March 31, 2014 0.5 0.7 1.2 June 30, 2014 2.2 1.0 0.5 3.7 September 30, 2014 1.5 2.5 0.4 4.4 Total $ 3.7 $ 5.2 $ 4.2 $ 13.1 The Company financing needs for the next 12 months are expected to arise from these debt and deposit maturities as well as changes in business needs, including changes in outstanding Card Member loans and receivables and acquisition activities. The Company considers various factors in determining the amount of liquidity it maintains, such as economic and financial market conditions, seasonality in business operations, growth in its businesses, potential acquisitions or dispositions, the cost and availability of alternative liquidity sources, and regulatory and credit rating agency considerations. The yield the Company receives on its cash and readily marketable securities is, generally, less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances. Thus, the Company incurs substantial net interest costs on these amounts. The level of net interest costs will be dependent on the size of the Company cash and readily marketable securities holdings, as well as the difference between its cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields. Refer also to Business Segment Results Corporate & Other. Securitized Borrowing Capacity As of September 30, 2013, the Company maintained its committed, revolving, secured financing facility, with a maturity date of September 15, 2015, that gives the Company the right to sell up to $2.0 billion face amount of eligible AAA certificates from the Lending Trust. On July 18, 2013, the Company terminated its existing $3.0 billion Charge Trust committed, revolving, secured financing facility with a maturity date of July 15, 2014 and entered into a new three-year committed, revolving, secured financing facility with a maturity date of July 15, 2016 that gives the Company the right to sell up to $3.0 billion face amount of eligible AAA notes from the Charge Trust II. Both facilities are used in the ordinary course of business to fund seasonal working capital needs, as well as to further enhance the Company contingent funding resources. 56 Table of Contents Federal Reserve Discount Window As insured depository institutions, the Banks may borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, subject to the amount of qualifying collateral that they may pledge. The Federal Reserve has indicated that both credit and charge card receivables are a form of qualifying collateral for secured borrowings made through the discount window. Whether specific assets will be considered qualifying collateral and the amount that may be borrowed against the collateral, remain at the discretion of the Federal Reserve. The Company had approximately $45.3 billion as of September 30, 2013 in U.S. credit card loans and charge card receivables that could be sold over time through its existing securitization trusts, or pledged in return for secured borrowings to provide further liquidity, subject in each case to applicable market conditions and eligibility criteria. Committed Bank Credit Facilities In addition to the secured financing facilities described above, the Company maintained committed syndicated bank credit facilities as of September 30, 2013, of $7.2 billion, which expire as follows: (Billions) 2015 (a) $ 4.9 2016 2.3 Total $ 7.2 (a) On July 19, 2013, the Company extended its current three-year Australian dollar credit facility scheduled to mature on August 3, 2014 by one year to mature on August 3, 2015. Certain Other Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of September 30, 2013, the Company had approximately $265 billion of unused credit available to Card Members as part of established lending product agreements. Total unused credit available to Card Members does not represent potential future cash requirements, as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn. The Company charge card products generally have no pre-set limit, and therefore are not reflected in unused credit available to Card Members. Cash Flows Cash Flows from Operating Activities Cash flows from operating activities primarily include net income adjusted for (i) non-cash items included in net income, including provisions for losses, depreciation and amortization, deferred taxes, and stock-based compensation and (ii) changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities, which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of various payments. For the nine months ended September 30, 2013, net cash provided by operating activities of $8.2 billion decreased $2.4 billion compared to $10.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, primarily due to smaller changes in accounts payable and other liabilities and a decrease in deferred taxes and other, partially offset by higher net income and an increase in provisions for losses. Cash Flows from Investing Activities The Company investing activities primarily include funding Card Member loans and receivables and the Company available for sale investment portfolio. For the nine months ended September 30, 2013, net cash used in investing activities of $1.5 billion decreased $1.5 billion compared to net cash used in investing activities of $3.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, primarily due to a smaller net increase related to Card Member loans and receivables and restricted cash, partially offset by higher purchases of investments. 57 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Financing Activities The Company financing activities primarily include issuing and repaying debt, taking customer deposits, issuing and repurchasing its common shares, and paying dividends. For the nine months ended September 30, 2013, net cash used in financing activities of $6.6 billion decreased $0.9 billion compared to $7.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, due to an increase in customer deposits and short-term borrowings, partially offset by an increase in principal payments on long-term debt. Certain Legislative, Regulatory and Other Developments As a participant in the financial services industry, the Company is subject to a wide array of regulations applicable to its businesses. As a bank holding company and a financial holding company, the Company is subject to comprehensive examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve and to a range of laws and regulations that impact its business and operations. In addition, the extreme disruptions in global capital markets that commenced in mid-2007 and the resulting instability and failure and near failure of numerous financial institutions, as well as reports of widespread consumer abuse, led to a number of changes in the financial services industry, including more intense supervision, enhanced enforcement activity, significant additional regulation and the formation of additional regulatory bodies. In light of recent legislative initiatives and continuing regulatory reform implementation, compliance requirements and expenditures have risen for financial services firms, including the Company, and the Company expects compliance requirements and expenditures will continue to rise with continuing implementation of these reforms. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act Dodd-Frank is comprehensive in scope and contains a wide array of provisions intended to govern the practices and oversight of financial institutions and other participants in the financial markets. Among other matters, the law created an independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the CFPB), which has broad rulemaking authority over providers of credit, savings, payment and other consumer financial products and services with respect to certain federal consumer financial laws. Moreover, the CFPB has examination and enforcement authority with respect to certain federal consumer financial laws for some providers of consumer financial products and services, including the Company insured depository institution subsidiaries. The CFPB is directed to prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices, and to ensure that all consumers have access to fair, transparent and competitive markets for consumer financial products and services. In July 2012, the CFPB issued a bulletin regarding its review of marketing practices with respect to credit card add-on products, including debt cancellation, identity theft protection, credit reporting and monitoring, and other supplementary products. The Company is cooperating with regulators in their ongoing regulatory review of credit card add-on products. More generally, the review of products and practices to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive conduct will be a continuing focus of the CFPB and banking regulators more broadly, as well as by the Company itself. Internal and regulatory reviews have resulted in, and will continue to result in, changes to pricing, practices, products and procedures. Such reviews will also continue to result in increased costs related to regulatory oversight, supervision and examination, additional restitution to Card Members and additional regulatory actions, including civil money penalties. In October 2012, the Company announced that it reached settlements with several bank regulators, including the CFPB, relating to certain aspects of the Company U.S. consumer card practices, which requires the Company to undertake certain actions in 2013. For a description of the settlements, see Legal Proceedings in the Company Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012. Dodd-Frank prohibits payment card networks from restricting merchants from offering discounts or incentives to customers to pay with particular forms of payment, such as cash, check, credit or debit card, or restricting merchants from setting certain minimum, and for certain merchants maximum, transaction 58 Table of Contents amounts for credit cards, as long as any such discounts or incentives or any minimum or maximum transaction amounts do not discriminate on the basis of the issuer or network and comply with applicable federal or state disclosure requirements. Under Dodd-Frank, the Federal Reserve is also authorized to regulate interchange fees paid to financial institutions on debit card and certain general-use prepaid card transactions to ensure that they are reasonable and proportional to the cost of processing individual transactions, and to prohibit payment card networks and issuers from requiring transactions to be processed on a single payment network or fewer than two unaffiliated networks. The Federal Reserve rule provides that the regulations on interchange and routing do not apply to a three-party network like American Express when it acts as both the issuer and the network for its prepaid cards, and the Company is therefore not a payment card network as that term is defined and used for the specific purposes of the rule. Dodd-Frank also authorizes the Federal Reserve to establish enhanced prudential regulatory requirements, including capital, leverage and liquidity standards, risk management requirements, concentration limits on credit exposures, mandatory resolution plans (so-called living wills ) and stress tests for, among others, large bank holding companies, such as the Company, that have greater than $50 billion in assets. The first resolution plan for the Company is required to be submitted by December 31, 2013 and annual updates will be required thereafter. The Company is also required to develop and maintain a capital plan, and to submit the capital plan to the Federal Reserve for its quantitative and qualitative review under the Federal Reserve Comprehensive Capital Plan and Review (CCAR) process. The Company expects to submit a capital plan for review under the CCAR process in early 2014. In addition, certain derivative transactions are now required to be centrally cleared, which will increase collateral posting requirements for the Company. Many provisions of Dodd-Frank require the adoption of rules for implementation. In addition, Dodd-Frank mandates multiple studies, which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action. These new rules and studies will be implemented and undertaken over a period of several years. Accordingly, the ultimate consequences of Dodd-Frank and its implementing regulations on the Company business, results of operations and financial condition continues to be uncertain at this time. Department of Justice Litigation The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and certain states attorneys general have brought an action against the Company alleging that the provisions in the Company card acceptance agreements with merchants that prohibit merchants from discriminating against the Company card products at the point of sale violate the U.S. antitrust laws. See Item 1. Legal Proceedings in Part II. Other Information for descriptions of the DOJ action and related cases. Visa and MasterCard, which were also defendants in the DOJ and state action, entered into a settlement agreement and have been dismissed as parties pursuant to that agreement. The settlement enjoins Visa and MasterCard, with certain exceptions, from adopting or enforcing rules or entering into contracts that prohibit merchants from engaging in various actions to steer cardholders to other card products or payment forms at the point of sale. If similar conditions were imposed on American Express, it could have a material adverse effect on American Express business. Other Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives The payment card sector also faces continuing scrutiny in connection with the fees merchants pay to accept cards. Regulators and legislators outside the United States have focused on the way bankcard network members collectively set the interchange (that is, the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in four-party payment networks, like Visa and MasterCard). Although, unlike the Visa and MasterCard networks, the American Express three-party payment network does not have interchange fees or collectively set any fees, antitrust actions and government regulation relating to merchant pricing could affect all networks. 59 Table of Contents In January 2012, the European Commission (the Commission) published a Green Paper (a document to begin a process of consultation toward potential regulation) covering a range of issues affecting the payments industry. The Commission completed the consultation process and on July 24, 2013, issued its recommendations, which included draft legislation. The Commission recommendations included a number of proposals that would likely have significant impact across the industry and would apply either in whole or in part to American Express. The proposed changes include: Price caps The Commission proposed capping interchange fees at 20 basis points for debit and prepaid cards and 30 basis points for credit and charge cards. Although American Express does not have interchange fees, the caps would be deemed to apply to elements of the financial arrangements agreed between American Express and each GNS partner. GNS pre-tax income in European Union (the EU) member states was approximately 12 percent of EMEA pre-tax income in 2012. The discount rates American Express agrees with merchants would not be capped, but the interchange caps could exert downward pressures on merchant fees across the industry, including American Express discount rates. The Commission would exclude commercial card transactions generally from the scope of these caps. Network rules on card acceptance The Commission proposed to prohibit honor-all-cards and anti-steering rules across all card networks. In addition, the draft proposals sought harmonization of surcharging rules so that, across the EU, transactions that are subject to the interchange caps may not be surcharged, but transactions falling outside the scope of the caps could be surcharged up to cost. Network licensing The Commission proposed to require all networks, including three-party payment networks that operate with licensing arrangements, which would include the Company GNS business, to establish objective, proportionate and non-discriminatory criteria under which a financial institution could qualify to be licensed to operate on the network. In addition, the scope of network licenses would be required to cover the entire EU. These requirements are inconsistent with the flexibility and discretion that American Express has had to date in deciding when, where and with whom to grant a license in the GNS business. Separation of network processing The Commission proposed to require card networks to separate their network processing functions (in which transactions between different issuers and acquirers are processed for authorization, clearing and settlement). This proposal does not apply to three-party payment networks, such as American Express, but may be deemed applicable in situations where a different GNS issuer and acquirer is involved in a transaction, which represent a very small percentage of transactions on the American Express network. Further clarification of the applicability of this requirement is needed where, as with GNS, licensing arrangements do not give rise to inter-bank transactions or relationships. As these are currently only proposals subject to debate and amendment by the European Parliament and Council in a complex legislative process that will likely take many months to complete, it is too early to assess what the exact scope and impact of any final legislation will be. In certain countries, such as Australia, and in certain member states in the EU, merchants are permitted by law to surcharge card purchases. While surcharging continues to be actively considered in certain jurisdictions, the benefits to customers have not been apparent in countries that have allowed it, and in some cases regulators are addressing concerns about excessive surcharging by merchants. Surcharging, particularly where it disproportionately impacts American Express Card Members, which is known as differential surcharging, could have a material adverse effect on the Company if it becomes widespread. In June 2012, the Reserve Bank of Australia announced changes to the Australian surcharging standards beginning March 18, 2013 that allows the Company and other networks to limit a merchant right to surcharge to the reasonable cost of card acceptance. In the EU, the Consumer Rights Directive, which was adopted by the EU Council of Ministers in October 2011, will prohibit merchants from surcharging card purchases more than the merchants cost of acceptance. The EU member states have until December 2013 to transpose the directive into national law. 60 Table of Contents Although neither a legislative nor regulatory initiative, the settlement by MasterCard and Visa in a U.S. merchant class litigation (which has been given preliminary, but not final, approval by the trial court) requires, among other things, MasterCard and Visa to permit U.S. merchants, subject to certain conditions, to surcharge credit cards, while allowing them to continue to prohibit surcharges on debit and prepaid card transactions. Also, other countries in which the Company operates have been considering and in some cases adopting similar legislation and rules that would impose changes on certain practices of card issuers, merchant acquirers and payment networks. Governments in several countries have established or are proposing to establish network regulatory regimes. Broad regulatory oversight over payment networks can include rules regarding fees involved in the operation of card networks and, in some cases, requirements for international card networks to be locally licensed and/or to localize aspects of their operations. The development and enforcement of regulatory regimes may adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and extend our global network. Refer to Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity for a discussion of capital adequacy requirements established by federal banking regulators. 61 Table of Contents Business Segment Results U.S. Card Services Selected Income Statement Data Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (Millions, except percentages) 2013 2012 Change 2013 2012 Change Revenues Discount revenue, net card fees and other $ 3,050 $ 2,887 $ 163 6 % $ 8,991 $ 8,566 $ 425 5 % Interest income 1,408 1,362 46 3 4,148 3,978 170 4 Interest expense 172 194 (22 ) (11) 532 568 (36 ) (6) Net interest income 1,236 1,168 68 6 3,616 3,410 206 6 Total revenues net of interest expense 4,286 4,055 231 6 12,607 11,976 631 5 Provisions for losses 331 339 (8 ) (2) 1,071 952 119 13 Total revenues net of interest expense after provisions for losses 3,955 3,716 239 6 11,536 11,024 512 5 Expenses Marketing, promotion, rewards and Card Member services 1,756 1,626 130 8 5,036 4,664 372 8 Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses 942 962 (20 ) (2) 2,798 2,903 (105 ) (4) Total expenses 2,698 2,588 110 4 7,834 7,567 267 4 Pretax segment income 1,257 1,128 129 11 3,702 3,457 245 7 Income tax provision 475 429 46 11 1,373 1,288 85 7 Segment income $ 782 $ 699 $ 83 12 % $ 2,329 $ 2,169 $ 160 7 % Effective tax rate 37.8 % 38.0 % 37.1 % 37.3 % 62 Table of Contents U.S. Card Services Selected Statistical Information As of or for the Three Months Ended September 30, As of or for the Nine Months Ended September 30, (Millions, except percentages and where indicated) 2013 2012 Change 2013 2012 Change Card billed business (billions) $ 124.6 $ 115.3 8 % $ 366.9 $ 339.0 8 % Total cards-in-force 43.4 41.8 4 % 43.4 41.8 4 % Basic cards-in-force 32.2 31.1 4 % 32.2 31.1 4 % Average basic Card Member spending (dollars) * $ 3,882 $ 3,725 4 % $ 11,547 $ 11,031 5 % U.S. Consumer Travel: Travel sales $ 900 $ 989 (9)% $ 3,102 $ 3,135 (1)% Travel commissions and fees/sales 7.9 % 7.6 % 7.0 % 7.6 % Total segment assets (billions) $ 95.2 $ 96.3 (1)% $ 95.2 $ 96.3 (1)% Segment capital $ 9,118 $ 9,100 % $ 9,118 $ 9,100 % Return on average segment capital (a) 30.8 % 32.5 % 30.8 % 32.5 % Return on average tangible segment capital (a) 32.0 % 34.0 % 32.0 % 34.0 % Card Member receivables: Total receivables (billions) $ 20.3 $ 19.5 4 % $ 20.3 $ 19.5 4 % 30 days past due as a % of total 1.7 % 1.8 % 1.7 % 1.8 % Average receivables (billions) $ 20.5 $ 19.4 6 % $ 20.3 $ 19.6 4 % Net write-off rate principal only (b) 1.4 % 1.6 % 1.8 % 2.0 % Net write-off rate principal and fees (b) 1.6 % 1.7 % 1.9 % 2.1 % Card Member loans: Total loans (billions) $ 54.5 $ 52.9 3 % $ 54.5 $ 52.9 3 % 30 days past due loans as a % of total 1.1 % 1.3 % 1.1 % 1.3 % Net write-off rate principal only (b) 1.7 % 1.9 % 1.9 % 2.2 % Net write-off rate principal, interest and fees (b) 1.9 % 2.1 % 2.1 % 2.4 % Calculation of Net Interest Yield on Card Member loans: Net interest income $ 1,236 $ 1,168 $ 3,616 $ 3,410 Exclude: Interest expense not attributable to the Company Card Member loan portfolio 45 51 140 153 Interest income not attributable to the Company Card Member loan portfolio (3 ) (3 ) (7 ) (7 ) Adjusted net interest income (c) $ 1,278 $ 1,216 $ 3,749 $ 3,556 Average loans (billions) $ 54.7 $ 52.8 $ 54.2 $ 52.3 Exclude: Unamortized deferred card fees, net of direct acquisition costs of Card Member loans (billions) Adjusted average loans (billions) (c) $ 54.7 $ 52.8 $ 54.2 $ 52.3 Net interest income divided by average loans 9.0 % 8.8 % 8.9 % 8.7 % Net interest yield on Card Member loans (c) 9.3 % 9.2 % 9.2 % 9.1 % * Proprietary cards only. 63 Table of Contents U.S. Card Services Selected Statistical Information (Continued) (a) Return on average segment capital is calculated by dividing (i) one-year period segment income ($2.8 billion and $2.9 billion for the twelve months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively) by (ii) one-year average segment capital ($8.9 billion for both the twelve months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012). Return on average tangible segment capital, a non-GAAP measure, is computed in the same manner as return on average segment capital except the computation of average tangible segment capital, a non-GAAP measure, excludes from average segment capital average goodwill and other intangibles of $345 million and $391 million as of September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Company believes return on average tangible segment capital is a useful measure of the profitability of its business. (b) Refer to Selected Statistical Information footnote (e) on page 42. (c) Net interest yield on Card Member loans, adjusted net interest income, and adjusted average loans are non-GAAP measures. Refer to Glossary of Selected Terminology for the definitions of these terms. The Company believes adjusted net interest income and adjusted average loans are useful to investors because they are components of net interest yield on Card Member loans, which provides a measure of profitability of the Company Card Member loan portfolio. Results of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2013 and 2012 USCS segment income increased $83 million or 12 percent and $160 million or 7 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. Total revenues net of interest expense increased $231 million or 6 percent and $631 million or 5 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily driven by higher discount revenue and increased net interest income as well as higher net card fees. Discount revenue, net card fees and other revenues increased $163 million or 6 percent and $425 million or 5 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to higher discount revenue resulting from billed business growth and higher net card fees. For the nine months ended September 30, 2013, these increases were partially offset by lower other revenues as a result of Card Member reimbursements. Billed business for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013 increased 8 percent, primarily driven by a 4 percent and 5 percent increase in average spending per proprietary basic cards-in-force the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. Interest income increased $46 million or 3 percent and $170 million or 4 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to a 4 percent increase in average Card Member loans and higher net interest yield on Card Member loans for both periods, as compared to the same periods in the prior year.

Return on average tangible segment capital, a non-GAAP measure, is computed in the same manner as return on average segment capital except the computation of average tangible segment capital, a non-GAAP measure, excludes from average segment capital average goodwill and other intangibles of $1.4 billion for both periods as of September 30, 2013 and 2012. The Company believes that return on average tangible segment capital is a useful measure of the profitability of its business. (b) Refer to Selected Statistical Information footnote (e) on page 42. (c) Net interest yield on Card Member loans, adjusted net interest income, and adjusted average loans are non-GAAP measures. Refer to Glossary of Selected Terminology for the definitions of these terms. The Company believes adjusted net interest income and adjusted average loans are useful to investors because they are components of net interest yield on Card Member loans, which provides a measure of profitability of the Company Card Member loan portfolio.

Total revenues net of interest expense increased $69 million or 5 percent and $185 million or 5 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to increased discount revenue and other commissions and fees. Discount revenue, net card fees and other revenues increased $71 million or 6 percent and $173 million or 5 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year.
