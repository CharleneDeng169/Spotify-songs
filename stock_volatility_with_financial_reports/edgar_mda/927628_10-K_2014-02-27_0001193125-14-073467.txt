Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A ) This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based upon management current expectations and are subject to significant uncertainties and changes in circumstances. Please review Forward-Looking Statements for more information on the forward-looking statements in this Report. Our actual results may differ materially from those included in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to, those described in this Report in Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors. Unless otherwise specified, references to notes to our consolidated financial statements refers to the notes to our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2013 included in this 2013 Annual Report. Management monitors a variety of key indicators to evaluate our business results and financial condition. The following MD&A is intended to provide the reader with an understanding of our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity by focusing on changes from year to year in certain key measures used by management to evaluate performance, such as profitability, growth and credit quality metrics. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2013 and accompanying notes. MD&A is organized in the following sections: Executive Summary and Business Outlook Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Accounting Changes and Developments Consolidated Results of Operations Business Segment Financial Performance Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Variable Interest Entities Capital Management Risk Management Credit Risk Profile Liquidity Risk Profile Market Risk Profile Supplemental Tables Glossary and Acronyms EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND BUSINESS OUTLOOK In 2013, we continued to deliver strong returns. All three of our business segments delivered growth in total revenues during the year, allowing us to remain focused on providing sustained and improved profitability and shareholder value. On July 2, 2013, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of shares of our common stock ( 2013 Stock Repurchase Program ) upon the closing of the Portfolio Sale. As of December 31, 2013, we have completed the repurchase of common stock as part of the 2013 Stock Repurchase Program. Financial Highlights We reported net income of $4.2 billion ($6.96 per diluted share) on total net revenue of $22.4 billion for 2013, with each of our three business segments contributing to our earnings. In comparison, we reported net income of $3.5 billion ($6.16 per diluted share) on total net revenue of $21.4 billion for 2012 and $3.1 billion ($6.80 per diluted share) on total net revenue of $16.3 billion in 2011. Our Tier 1 common ratio, as calculated under Basel I, increased to 12.23% as of December 31, 2013, up 127 basis points from 10.96% as of December 31, 2012. The increase in our Tier 1 common ratio reflects strong internal capital generation from earnings and the full benefit of the decline in risk weighted assets from the Portfolio Sale, which was offset by the decline in capital level from the 2013 Stock Repurchase Program. See Capital Management below for additional information. 44 Table of Contents Below are additional highlights of our performance in 2013. These highlights generally are based on a comparison between 2013 and 2012 results, except as otherwise noted. The changes in our financial condition and credit performance are generally based on our financial condition and credit performance as of December 31, 2013, compared with our financial condition and credit performance as of December 31, 2012. We provide a more detailed discussion of our financial performance in the sections following this Executive Summary and Business Outlook. Total Company Earnings : Our net income increased by $642 million in 2013, or 18%, to $4.2 billion, compared to $3.5 billion for 2012. A significant driver of the increase in earnings in 2013 was the growth in interest income attributable to (i) the increase in average interest-earning assets as a result of the ING Direct and 2012 U.S. card acquisitions, growth in purchase volumes in the Credit Card business and growth in auto loans, partially offset by the Portfolio Sale and the expected run-off of home loans, and (ii) the decrease in interest expense due to lower costs related to borrowings and debt obligations. Another factor contributing to the increase in earnings was the absence in 2013 of the provision for credit losses of $1.2 billion related to the credit card receivables acquired in the 2012 U.S. card acquisition recorded in the second quarter of 2012. This effect was partially offset by the absence in 2013 of the bargain purchase gain of $594 million recorded in 2012 at the acquisition of ING Direct in the first quarter of 2012 and higher ongoing operating expenses. Loans Held for Investment: Period-end loans held for investment decreased by $8.7 billion, or 4%, in 2013, to $197.2 billion as of December 31, 2013, from $205.9 billion as of December 31, 2012. The decrease was partially due to the Portfolio Sale. In addition to the Portfolio Sale, period-end loans held for investment also decreased due to the expected run-off of certain credit card loans acquired in the 2012 U.S. card acquisition, installment loans in our Credit Card business, home loans in our Consumer Banking business and small-ticket commercial real estate loans in our Commercial Banking business. This run-off was partially offset by continued strong auto loan originations in our Consumer Banking business and commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loan growth in our Commercial Banking business. Charge-off and Delinquency Statistics : Our net charge-off rate increased by 15 basis points in 2013 to 2.04%, compared to 1.89% for 2012. The increases in our reported net charge-offs and net charge-off rate were largely due to the run-off of certain credit card loans acquired in the 2012 U.S. card acquisition. Acquired loans from this portfolio generally have no charge-offs, but the balance is included in the denominator. As such, when these loans run-off and are replaced with originated loans, our charge-off rates increase. Our reported 30+ day delinquency rate declined to 2.96% as of December 31, 2013, from 3.09% as of December 31, 2012. We provide information on our credit quality metrics below under Business Segment Financial Performance and Credit Risk Profile. Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses : We reduced our allowance by $841 million to $4.3 billion as of December 31, 2013, from $5.2 billion as of December 31, 2012. The decrease in the allowance was mainly due to an overall improved credit outlook coupled with improvements in delinquency inventories and the reduction in loan balances. In addition, the allowance was reduced by $289 million related to the Portfolio Sale in the third quarter of 2013. The allowance coverage ratio declined to 2.19% as of December 31, 2013, from 2.50% as of December 31, 2012. Representation and Warranty Reserve : We recorded a mortgage representation and warranty provision of $309 million in 2013 compared to $349 million in 2012. Our mortgage representation and warranty reserve increased to $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2013, from $899 million as of December 31, 2012. The increase in the reserve is primarily due to increased litigation and estimated settlement rates on active litigation. Business Segment Financial Performance Credit Card: Our Credit Card business generated net income from continuing operations of $2.6 billion in 2013, compared with net income from continuing operations of $1.5 billion in 2012. The increase in net 45 Table of Contents income from continuing operations of $1.1 billion was driven by the absence in 2013 of the provision for credit losses of $1.2 billion to establish an allowance for the credit card receivables acquired in the 2012 U.S. card acquisition and the absence in 2013 of the $174 million charge to establish a reserve for estimated uncollectible billed finance charges and fees related to those loans, both of which were recorded in 2012. The improvement also reflects higher revenue attributable to the 2012 U.S. card acquisition coupled with increased purchase volume in our Credit Card business. The increase in net revenues was partially offset by higher operating expenses resulting from the 2012 U.S. card acquisition. Period-end loans held for investment in our Credit Card business decreased by $10.5 billion to $81.3 billion as of December 31, 2013 from $91.8 billion as of December 31, 2012. The decrease was largely due to the Portfolio Sale and continued run-off of our installment loan portfolio and certain other credit card loans acquired in the 2012 U.S. card acquisition. Consumer Banking: Our Consumer Banking business generated net income from continuing operations of $1.5 billion in 2013, compared with net income from continuing operations of $1.4 billion in 2012. The modest increase in net income is due to higher interest income related to growth in average interest earning assets in auto partially offset by the run-off of home loans. Period-end loans held for investment in our Consumer Banking business decreased by $4.3 billion, or 6%, to $70.8 billion as of December 31, 2013, from $75.1 billion as of December 31, 2012, due to the run-off of acquired home loans partially offset by strong auto loan originations. Commercial Banking: Our Commercial Banking business generated net income from continuing operations of $769 million in 2013, compared with net income from continuing operations of $835 million in 2012. The decrease in net income of $66 million is due to a higher provision for credit losses. The higher provision for credit losses was driven by lower allowance releases, which was partially offset by loan growth in 2013 compared to the prior year. This was partially offset by higher revenues due to growth in commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans and higher deposit balances and fee-based product and services revenue. Period-end loans held for investment in our Commercial Banking business increased by $6.2 billion, or 16%, to $45.0 billion as of December 31, 2013, from $38.8 billion as of December 31, 2012. The increase was driven by strong loan originations in the commercial and industrial and commercial real estate businesses, which were partially offset by the continued run-off of the small-ticket commercial real estate loan portfolio. Business Outlook We discuss below our current expectations regarding our total company performance and the performance of each of our business segments over the near-term based on market conditions, the regulatory environment and our business strategies as of the time we filed this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The statements contained in this section are based on our current expectations regarding our outlook for our financial results and business strategies. Our expectations take into account, and should be read in conjunction with, our expectations regarding economic trends and analysis of our business as discussed in Part I Item 1. Business and Part II Item 7. MD&A of this Report. Certain statements are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results could differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements. Except as otherwise disclosed, forward-looking statements do not reflect: (i) any change in current dividend or repurchase strategies, (ii) the effect of any acquisitions, divestitures or similar transactions that have not been previously disclosed, or (iii) any changes in laws, regulations or regulatory interpretations, in each case after the date as of which such statements are made. See Part I Item 1. Business Forward-Looking Statements for more information on the forward-looking statements in this Report and Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Report for factors that could materially influence our results. Total Company Expectations Our strategies and actions are designed to deliver and sustain strong returns and capital generation through the acquisition and retention of franchise-enhancing customer relationships across our businesses. We believe that 46 Table of Contents franchise-enhancing customer relationships create and sustain significant long-term value through low risk-adjusted credit costs, long and loyal customer relationships and a gradual build in loan balances and revenues over time. Examples of franchise-enhancing customer relationships include rewards customers and partnerships in our Credit Card business, retail deposit customers in our Consumer Banking business and primary banking relationships with commercial customers in our Commercial Banking business. We intend to grow these customer relationships by continuing to invest in scalable infrastructure and operating platforms, so that we can meet the heightened risk management expectations facing all banks and deliver a brand-defining customer experience that builds and sustains a valuable, long-term customer franchise. We expect 2014 pre-provision net revenue, excluding non-recurring items, of approximately $9.8 billion. In 2014, we expect very modest revenue growth, after adjusting for the Portfolio Sale. We also expect operating expenses in 2014 to be approximately $10.5 billion, excluding non-recurring items. These estimates are expected to vary within a reasonable margin of error. We anticipate that marketing expenses will rise in 2014, although actual marketing expenses will depend on our assessment of the market and competitive opportunities. In addition, we continue to expect portfolio run-off of approximately $1 billion in card loans and $4 billion in home loans in 2014. We believe our actions have created a well-positioned balance sheet with strong capital and liquidity. In our recent submission in the 2014 CCAR cycle, we requested share repurchases that, if approved, would result in a total payout ratio well above the 2013 industry norm of approximately 50%. See MD&A Capital Management-Capital Planning and Regulatory Stress Testing for more information. Business Segment Expectations Credit Card: We expect Domestic Card loan growth in the coming quarters to be muted as planned run-off and other strategic choices we have made continue to mask strong underlying growth in areas we are emphasizing. We expect loan growth in Domestic Card to resume sometime around the second half of 2014, when underlying loan growth will begin to more than offset shrinkage in other parts of the business. Trends in loans and purchase volumes continue to reflect our strategic choices. Overall, we believe that our Domestic Card business continues to be well-positioned and will continue to deliver strong, sustainable and resilient returns and generate capital on a strong trajectory. Consumer Banking: In our Consumer Banking business, we expect continued run-off in the acquired Home Loans portfolio to have a significant impact on loan balances. In Auto, we expect credit losses will continue to increase from the historic lows of the past few years and Auto revenues, margins and returns to continue to decline, but remain resilient and within ranges that support an attractive business. In addition, we expect the inexorable impacts of the prolonged low interest rate environment to continue to pressure the economics of our retail deposit businesses even if rates begin to rise in 2014. Commercial Banking: Our Commercial Banking business loan growth, credit and profitability trends remain healthy. While increasing competition, particularly in middle-market lending, may continue to impact the pricing and volume of our new loan originations, we expect our focus and specialized approach to deliver strong results in 2014. 47 Table of Contents Table 1: Business Segment Results Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 Total Net Revenue (1) Net Income (Loss) (2) Total Net Revenue (1) Net Income (Loss) (2) Total Net Revenue (1) Net Income (Loss) (2) (Dollars in millions) Amount % of Total Amount % of Total Amount % of Total Amount % of Total Amount % of Total Amount % of Total Credit Card $ 14,287 64 % $ 2,615 60 % $ 13,260 62 % $ 1,530 41 % $ 10,431 64 % $ 2,277 70 % Consumer Banking 6,654 30 1,451 33 6,570 30 1,363 37 4,956 30 809 25 Commercial Banking (3) 2,290 10 769 17 2,080 10 835 22 1,879 12 595 18 Other (4) (847 ) (4 ) (443 ) (10 ) (514 ) (2 ) 6 (987 ) (6 ) (428 ) (13 ) Total from continuing operations $ 22,384 100 % $ 4,392 100 % $ 21,396 100 % $ 3,734 100 % $ 16,279 100 % $ 3,253 100 % (1) Total net revenue consists of net interest income and non-interest income.

(4) Includes the residual impact of the allocation of our centralized Corporate Treasury group activities to our business segments as well as other items as described in Note 19 Business Segments . CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make a number of judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses in the consolidated financial statements. Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We provide a summary of our significant accounting policies under Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . We have identified the following accounting policies as critical because they require significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our reported results of operations or financial condition. These critical accounting policies govern: Loan loss reserves Asset impairment Fair value of financial instruments Representation and warranty reserves Customer rewards reserves Income taxes We evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and update them, as necessary, based on changing conditions. Management has discussed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Loan Loss Reserves We maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses that represents management estimate of incurred loan and lease losses inherent in our held-for-investment credit card, consumer banking and commercial banking loan portfolios as of each balance sheet date, as well as a reserve for unfunded lending commitments, such as letters of credit and financial guarantees, and binding unfunded loan commitments. We also maintain a separate reserve for the uncollectible portion of billed finance charges and fees on credit card loans. 48 Table of Contents Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses We have an established process, using analytical tools and management judgment, to determine our allowance for loan and lease losses. Losses are inherent in our loan portfolio and we calculate the allowance for loan and lease losses by estimating incurred losses for segments of our loan portfolio with similar risk characteristics and record a provision for credit losses. We build our allowance for loan and lease losses and unfunded lending commitment reserves through the provision for credit losses. Our provision for credit losses in each period is driven by charge-offs, changes to allowance for loan and lease losses, and changes to unfunded lending commitments. We recorded a provision for credit losses of $3.5 billion, $4.4 billion and $2.4 billion in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The allowance totaled $4.3 billion as of December 31, 2013, compared with $5.2 billion as of December 31, 2012. We review and assess our allowance methodologies and adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses on a quarterly basis. Our assessment involves evaluating many factors including, but not limited to, historical loss and recovery experience, recent trends in delinquencies and charge-offs, risk ratings, the impact of bankruptcy filings, the value of collateral underlying secured loans, account seasoning, changes in our credit evaluation, underwriting and collection management policies, seasonality, general economic conditions, changes in the legal and regulatory environment and uncertainties in forecasting and modeling techniques used in estimating our allowance for loan and lease losses. Key factors that have a significant impact on our allowance for loan and lease losses include assumptions about unemployment rates, home prices, and the valuation of commercial properties, consumer real estate, and automobiles. Although we examine a variety of externally available data, as well as our internal loan performance data, to determine our allowance for loan and lease losses, our estimation process is subject to risks and uncertainties, including a reliance on historical loss and trend information that may not be representative of current conditions and indicative of future performance. Accordingly, our actual credit loss experience may not be in line with our expectations. We provide additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used in determining our allowance for loan and lease losses for each of our loan portfolio segments in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. We provide information on the components of our allowance, disaggregated by impairment methodology, and changes in our allowance in Note 5 Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses. Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we also estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments, such as letters of credit and financial guarantees, and binding unfunded loan commitments. Our commercial loan portfolio is primarily composed of larger-balance, non-homogeneous loans. We determine the allowance and reserve for unfunded lending commitments for our commercial loan portfolio by evaluating loans with similar risk characteristics and applying internal risk ratings. We use these risk ratings to assess credit quality and derive a total loss estimate based on an estimated probability of default and loss given default. Factors we consider in determining risk ratings and deriving loss estimates include historical loss experience for loans with similar risk characteristics, the financial condition of the borrower, geography, collateral performance and industry-specific information that management believes is relevant. Management may also apply judgment to adjust the derived loss factors, taking into consideration both quantitative and qualitative factors, including general economic conditions, specific industry and geographic trends, portfolio concentrations, trends in internal credit quality indicators and current and past underwriting standards that have occurred but are not yet reflected in the historical data underlying our loss estimates. Finance Charge and Fee Reserves Finance charges and fees on credit card loans, net of amounts that we consider uncollectible, are included in loan receivables and revenue when the finance charges and fees are earned. We continue to accrue finance charges and fees on credit card loans until the account is charged-off; however, when we do not expect full payment of 49 Table of Contents billed finance charges and fees, we reduce the balance of our credit card loan receivables by the amount of finance charges and fees billed but not expected to be collected and exclude this amount from revenue. Total net revenue was reduced by $796 million, $937 million and $371 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, for the estimated uncollectible amount of billed finance charges and fees. The finance charge and fee reserve totaled $190 million as of December 31, 2013, compared with $307 million as of December 31, 2012. We review and assess the adequacy of the uncollectible finance charge and fee reserve on a quarterly basis. Our methodology for estimating the uncollectible portion of billed finance charges and fees is consistent with the methodology we use to estimate the allowance for incurred principal losses on our credit card loan receivables. Asset Impairment In addition to our loan portfolio, we review other assets for impairment on a regular basis in accordance with applicable impairment accounting guidance. This process requires significant management judgment and involves various estimates and assumptions. Our investment securities and goodwill and intangible assets represent a significant portion of our other assets. Accordingly, below we describe our process for assessing impairment of these assets and the key estimates and assumptions involved in this process. Investment Securities We regularly review investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ) using both quantitative and qualitative criteria. If we intend to sell a security in an unrealized loss position or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, the entire difference between the amortized cost basis of the security and its fair value is recognized in earnings. If we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost, we evaluate other qualitative criteria to determine whether a credit loss exists. Our evaluation requires significant management judgment and a consideration of many factors, including, but not limited to, the extent and duration of the impairment; the health of and specific prospects for the issuer, including whether the issuer has failed to make scheduled interest or principal payments; recent events specific to the issuer and/or industry to which the issuer belongs; the payment structure of the security; external credit ratings; the value of underlying collateral and current market conditions. Quantitative criteria include assessing whether there has been an adverse change in expected future cash flows. See Note 3 Investment Securities for additional information. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill resulting from business combinations prior to January 1, 2009 represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill resulting from business combinations after January 1, 2009, is generally determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Goodwill totaled $14.0 billion and $13.9 billion as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Other intangible assets, which we report on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other assets, consist primarily of purchased credit card relationships ( PCCR ) and core deposit intangibles. The net carrying value of other intangible assets decreased to $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2013, from $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2012. Goodwill and other intangible assets together represented 5% of our total assets as of both December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We did not recognize goodwill impairment in 2013, 2012 or 2011. 50 Table of Contents Goodwill Goodwill is not amortized but must be allocated to reporting units and tested for impairment on an annual basis or in interim periods if events or circumstances indicate potential impairment. A reporting unit is a business segment or one level below. We have elected not to perform the optional qualitative assessment and proceeded directly to the quantitative impairment test. The goodwill impairment test, performed at October 1 of each year, is a two-step test. The first step identifies whether there is potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to the carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the second step of the impairment test is required to measure the amount of any impairment loss. We do not maintain separate balance sheets at the reporting unit level; therefore, we calculate the carrying values of our reporting units using an economic capital approach based on each reporting unit specific regulatory capital requirements (reflective of the final Basel III rules released during 2013) and risks. We compare the total reporting unit carrying values to our total consolidated stockholders equity, as discussed further in Note 7 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, to assess the appropriateness of our methodology. If the second step of goodwill impairment testing is required for a reporting unit, we undertake an extensive effort to build the specific reporting unit balance sheet for the test based on applicable accounting guidance. Estimating the fair value of reporting units and the assets, liabilities and intangible assets of a reporting unit is a subjective process that involves the use of estimates and judgments, particularly related to cash flows, the appropriate discount rates and an applicable control premium. The fair value of reporting units is calculated using a discounted cash flow model, a form of the income approach. The model projects cash flows based on each reporting unit internal forecast and use the perpetuity growth method to calculate terminal values . These cash flows and terminal values are then discounted using appropriate discount rates, which are largely based on our external cost of equity with adjustments for risk inherent in each reporting unit: Cash flows are adjusted, as necessary, in order to maintain each reporting unit equity capital requirements. Our discounted cash flow analysis requires management to make judgments about future loan and deposit growth, revenue growth, credit losses, and capital rates. Discount rates used in 2013 for the reporting units ranged from 8.0% to 12.5%. The key inputs into the discounted cash flow analysis were consistent with market data, where available, indicating that assumptions used were within a reasonable range of observable market data. Based on our analysis, fair value exceeded the carrying amount for all reporting units as of our annual testing date, therefore, the second step of impairment testing was unnecessary. As part of the annual goodwill impairment test, we also assess our market capitalization based on the average market price relative to the aggregate fair value of our reporting units and determined that any excess fair value in our reporting units at that time could be attributed to a reasonable control premium compared to historical control premiums seen in the industry. We will continue to regularly monitor our market capitalization in 2014, overall economic conditions and other events or circumstances that may result in an impairment of goodwill in the future. Other Intangible Assets Intangible assets with definitive useful lives are amortized over their estimated lives and evaluated for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset or asset group carrying value may not be fully recoverable. An impairment loss, generally calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of an asset or asset group, is recognized if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset or asset group is less than the corresponding carrying value. We did not recognize impairment on other intangible assets in 2013, 2012 or 2011. 51 Table of Contents Mortgage Servicing Rights Mortgage servicing rights ( MSR ) are initially recorded at fair value when mortgage loans are sold or securitized in the secondary market and the right to service these loans is retained for a fee. Subsequently, our consumer related MSRs are carried at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair value recognized in non-interest income. Our commercial mortgage related MSRs are subsequently measured under the amortization method and are periodically evaluated for impairment, which is recognized as a reduction in non-interest income. See Note 7 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Note 18 Fair Value of Financial Instruments for additional information. Fair Value Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date (also referred to as an exit price). The fair value accounting guidance provides a three-level fair value hierarchy for classifying financial instruments. This hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable. Fair value measurement of a financial asset or liability is assigned to a level based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2: Observable market-based inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 3: Unobservable inputs The degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted prices in active markets or observable market parameters. When quoted prices and observable data in active markets are not fully available, management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. Changes in market conditions, such as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities, may reduce the availability and reliability of quoted prices or observable data used to determine fair value. We have developed policies and procedures to determine when markets for our financial assets and liabilities are inactive if the level and volume of activity has declined significantly relative to normal conditions. If markets are determined to be inactive, it may be appropriate to adjust price quotes received. When significant adjustments are required to price quotes or inputs, it may be appropriate to utilize an estimate based primarily on unobservable inputs. Significant judgment may be required to determine whether certain financial instruments measured at fair value are included in Level 2 or Level 3. In making this determination, we consider all available information that market participants use to measure the fair value of the financial instrument, including observable market data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs used. Based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category, judgments are made regarding the significance of the Level 3 inputs to the instruments fair value measurement in its entirety. If Level 3 inputs are considered significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3. The process for determining fair value using unobservable inputs is generally more subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and assumptions. Our financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis represented approximately 14% and 21% of our total assets as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively. Financial assets for which the fair value was determined using significant Level 3 inputs represented approximately 8% and 5% of these financial instruments as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. 52 Table of Contents We discuss changes in the valuation inputs and assumptions used in determining the fair value of our financial instruments, including the extent to which we have relied on significant unobservable inputs to estimate fair value and our process for corroborating these inputs, in Note 18 Fair Value of Financial Instruments. Key Controls Over Fair Value Measurement We have a governance framework and a number of key controls that are intended to ensure that our fair value measurements are appropriate and reliable. Our governance framework provides for independent oversight and segregation of duties. Our control processes include review and approval of new transaction types, price verification and review of valuation judgments, methods, models, process controls and results. Groups independent from our trading and investing functions, including our Corporate Valuations Group ( CVG ), Fair Value Committee and Model Validation Group, participate in the review and validation process. The fair valuation governance process is set up in a manner that allows the Chairperson of the Fair Value Committee ( FVC ) to escalate valuation disputes that cannot be resolved at the FVC to a more senior committee called the Valuations Advisory Committee for resolution. The Valuations Advisory Committee ( VAC ) is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and includes other senior management. The VAC is only convened to review escalated valuation disputes and did not meet during 2013. The CVG performs periodic independent verification of fair value measurements to determine if assigned fair values are reasonable. For example, in cases where we rely on third party pricing services to obtain fair value measures, we analyze pricing variances among different pricing sources and validate the final price used by comparing the information to additional sources, including dealer pricing indications in transaction results and other internal sources, where necessary. Additional validation procedures performed by the CVG include reviewing (either directly or indirectly through the reasonableness of assigned fair values) valuation inputs and assumptions, and monitoring acceptable variances between recommended prices and validation prices. The CVG and the Trade Analytics and Valuation team perform due diligence reviews of the third party pricing services by comparing their prices with prices from other sources and reviewing other control documentation. Additionally, when necessary, the CVG and Trade Analytics and Valuation Team ( TAV ) challenge prices from third party vendors to ensure reasonableness of prices through a pricing challenge process. This may include a request for a transparency of the assumptions used by the third party. The FVC, which includes representation from business areas, our Risk Management division and our Finance division, is a forum for discussing fair market valuations, inputs, assumptions, methodologies, variance thresholds, valuation control environment and material risks or concerns related to fair market valuations. Additionally, the FVC is empowered to resolve valuation disputes between the primary valuation providers and the CVG. It provides guidance and oversight to ensure an appropriate valuation control environment. The FVC regularly reviews and approves our valuation methodologies to ensure that our methodologies and practices are consistent with industry standards and adhere to regulatory and accounting guidance. The Chief Financial Officer determines when material issues or concerns regarding valuations shall be raised to the Audit Committee or other delegated committee of the Board of Directors. We have a model policy, established by an independent Model Risk Office, which governs the validation of models and related supporting documentation to ensure the appropriate use of models for pricing. The Model Validation Group is part of the Model Risk Office and validates all models and provides ongoing monitoring of their performance, including the validation and monitoring of the performance of all valuation models. Representation and Warranty Reserve In connection with their sales of mortgage loans, certain subsidiaries entered into agreements containing varying representations and warranties about, among other things, the ownership of the loan, the validity of the lien securing the loan, the loan compliance with any applicable loan criteria established by the purchaser, including underwriting guidelines and the ongoing existence of mortgage insurance, and the loan compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws. We may be required to repurchase the mortgage loan, indemnify the investor or insurer, or reimburse the investor for loan and lease losses incurred on the loan in the event of a material breach of contractual representations or warranties. 53 Table of Contents We have established representation and warranty reserves for losses that we consider to be both probable and reasonably estimable associated with the mortgage loans sold by each subsidiary, including both litigation and non-litigation liabilities. The reserve-setting process relies heavily on estimates, which are inherently uncertain, and requires the application of judgment. In establishing the representation and warranty reserves, we consider a variety of factors, depending on the category of purchaser and rely on historical data. These factors include, but are not limited to, the historical relationship between loan losses and repurchase outcomes; the percentage of current and future loan defaults that we anticipate will result in repurchase requests over the lifetime of the loans; the percentage of those repurchase requests that we anticipate will result in actual repurchases; and estimated collateral valuations. We evaluate these factors and update our loss forecast models on a quarterly basis to estimate our lifetime liability. Our aggregate representation and warranty mortgage repurchase reserves, which we report as a component of other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, totaled $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2013, compared with $899 million as of December 31, 2012. The adequacy of the reserves and the ultimate amount of losses incurred by us or one of our subsidiaries will depend on, among other things, actual future mortgage loan performance, the actual level of future repurchase and indemnification requests, the actual success rates of claimants, developments in litigation, actual recoveries on the collateral and macroeconomic conditions (including unemployment levels and housing prices). As part of our business planning processes, we have considered various outcomes relating to the potential future representation and warranty liabilities of our subsidiaries that are possible but do not rise to the level of being both probable and reasonably estimable outcomes justifying an incremental accrual under applicable accounting standards. Our current best estimate of reasonably possible future losses from representation and warranty claims beyond what was in our reserve as of December 31, 2013 is approximately $2.6 billion, a decline from our estimate of $2.7 billion as of December 31, 2012. Notwithstanding our ongoing attempts to estimate a reasonably possible amount of future losses beyond our current accrual levels based on current information, it is possible that actual future losses will exceed both the current accrual level and our current estimate of the amount of reasonably possible losses. This estimate involves considerable judgment, and reflects that there is still significant uncertainty regarding the numerous factors that may impact the ultimate loss levels, including, but not limited to, anticipated litigation outcomes, future repurchase and indemnification claim levels, ultimate repurchase and indemnification rates, future mortgage loan performance levels, actual recoveries on the collateral and macroeconomic conditions (including unemployment levels and housing prices). In light of the significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability our subsidiaries may incur from these matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period. See Note 20 Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees, and Others for additional information. Customer Rewards Reserve We offer products, primarily credit cards, which offer reward program members with various rewards, such as cash, gift cards, airline tickets or merchandise. The majority of our rewards do not expire and there is no limit on the number of reward points an eligible card member may earn. Customer rewards costs, which we generally record as an offset to interchange income, are driven by various factors, such as card member charge volume, customer participation in the rewards program and contractual arrangements with redemption partners. We establish a customer rewards reserve that reflects management judgment regarding rewards earned that are expected to be redeemed and the estimated redemption cost. We use financial models to estimate ultimate redemption rates of rewards earned to date by current card members based on historical redemption trends, current enrollee redemption behavior, card product type, year of program enrollment, enrollment tenure and card spend levels. Our current assumption is that the vast majority of all rewards earned will eventually be redeemed. We use a weighted-average cost per reward redeemed during the previous twelve months, adjusted as appropriate for recent changes in redemption costs, including mix of rewards redeemed, to estimate future redemption costs. 54 Table of Contents We continually evaluate our reserve methodology and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns, cost per point redeemed, contract changes and other factors. Changes in the ultimate redemption rate and weighted-average cost per point have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the reserve through the current period provision by an amount estimated to cover the cost of all points previously earned but not yet redeemed by card members as of the end of the reporting period. We recognized customer rewards expense of $1.6 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.0 billion in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Our customer rewards liability, which is included in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, totaled $2.3 billion and $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Income Taxes Our annual provision for income tax expense is based on our income, statutory tax rates and other provisions of tax law applicable to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment, including evaluating uncertainties, is required in determining our tax positions and calculating our tax expense. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Our income tax expense consists of two components: current and deferred taxes. Our current income tax expense approximates taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period. It also includes income tax expense related to our uncertain tax positions and revisions of our estimate of accrued income taxes resulting from the resolution of income tax controversies. Our deferred income tax expense results from changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent decreases or increases in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of future reversals of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management judgment that realization is more likely than not. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of expected taxable income from all sources, including taxable income in carryback years, reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates. We use our historical experience and our short- and long-range business forecasts to provide insight. As of December 31, 2013, we have recorded deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities and valuation allowances, of approximately $3.7 billion, an increase of $0.8 billion from $2.9 billion at December 31, 2012. We have recorded a valuation allowance of $139 million and $123 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We expect to fully realize the net deferred tax asset amounts in future periods. If changes in circumstances lead us to change our judgment about our ability to realize deferred tax assets in future years, we will adjust our valuation allowances in the period that our change in judgment occurs and record a corresponding increase or charge to income. We provide additional information on income taxes in Consolidated Results of Operations and in Note 17 Income Taxes. ACCOUNTING CHANGES AND DEVELOPMENTS See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for information on accounting standards adopted in 2013, as well as recently issued accounting standards not yet required to be adopted and the expected impact of these changes in accounting standards. To the extent we believe the adoption of new accounting standards has had or will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity, we discuss the impacts in the applicable section(s) of MD&A. 55 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The section below provides a comparative discussion of our consolidated financial performance between 2013 and 2012 and between 2012 and 2011. Following this section, we provide a discussion of our business segment results. You should read this section together with our Executive Summary and Business Outlook, where we discuss trends and other factors that we expect will affect our future results of operations. Net Interest Income Net interest income represents the difference between the interest income and applicable fees earned on our interest-earning assets, which include loans and investment securities, and the interest expense on our interest-bearing liabilities, which include interest-bearing deposits, senior and subordinated notes, securitized debt and other borrowings. We include in interest income any past due fees on loans that we deem collectible. Our net interest margin based on our consolidated results represents the difference between the yield on our interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities, including the impact of non-interest bearing funding. We expect net interest income and our net interest margin to fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 56 Table of Contents Table 2 below presents, for each major category of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the average outstanding balances, interest income earned, interest expense incurred, average yield and rate for 2013, 2012 and 2011.

(2) Past due fees included in interest income totaled approximately $1.7 billion in both 2013 and 2012, and $1.1 billion in 2011. (3) Interest income and interest expense and the calculation of average yields on interest-earning assets and average rates on interest-bearing liabilities include the impact of hedge accounting. (4) Prior to the second quarter of 2013, average balances for investment securities were calculated based on fair value amounts. Effective in the second quarter of 2013, average balances are calculated based on the amortized cost of investment securities. The impact of this change on prior period yields is not material. 57 Table of Contents Net interest income of $18.1 billion in 2013 increased by $1.5 billion, or 9%, from 2012, driven by a 4% increase in average interest-earning assets and a 5% (30 basis point) increase in net interest margin to 6.80%. Average Interest-Earning Assets : The increase in average interest-earning assets in 2013 compared to 2012 reflects the full year impact of loans and investment securities from the ING Direct acquisition and the addition of loans from the 2012 U.S. card acquisition. Growth in average interest-earning assets was also driven by continued strong growth in commercial and auto loans, which was partially offset by the continued run-off of home loans in our Consumer Banking business, the expected run-off of higher-margin, higher-loss receivables acquired in the 2012 U.S. card acquisition and installment loans in our Credit Card business, as well as the Portfolio Sale in the third quarter of 2013. Net Interest Margin : The increase in our net interest margin in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily attributable to a reduction in our cost of funds, which was due in part to the redemption of $3.65 billion of our trust preferred securities on January 2, 2013, which generally carried a higher coupon than other funding sources available to us. Our lowered cost of funds also reflects the continued benefit from the shift in the mix of our funding to lower cost consumer and commercial banking deposits from higher cost wholesale sources and a decline in deposit interest rates as a result of the continued overall low interest rate environment. Net interest income of $16.6 billion in 2012 increased by $3.8 billion, or 30%, from 2011, driven by a 46% increase in average interest-earning assets, which was partially offset by an 11% (77 basis points) decline in our net interest margin to 6.50%. Average Interest-Earning Assets : The significant increase in average interest-earning assets reflects the addition of the ING Direct loan portfolio of $40.4 billion in the first quarter of 2012 and the addition of the $27.8 billion in outstanding receivables acquired in the 2012 U.S. card acquisition and designated as held for investment in the second quarter of 2012. Growth in average interest-earning assets was also driven by continued strong growth in commercial and auto loans, which was partially offset by the continued expected run-off of home loans in our Consumer Banking business, as well as the expected run-off of higher-margin, higher-loss receivables acquired in the 2012 U.S. card acquisition and installment loans in our Credit Card business. The run-off of home loans accelerated slightly as a result of the low mortgage interest rate environment. Net Interest Margin : The decrease in our net interest margin in 2012 was attributable to a decline in the average yield on our interest-earning assets, largely due to the shift in the mix of our interest-earning assets to a larger proportion of lower yielding assets resulting from the acquired ING Direct home loan and investment securities portfolios and temporarily higher cash balances from equity and debt offerings. The ING Direct interest-earning assets generally have lower yields than our legacy loan and investment securities portfolios. In addition, the establishment of a finance charge and fee reserve of $174 million in the second quarter of 2012 for the receivables acquired in the 2012 U.S. card acquisition and premium amortization related to the ING Direct and 2012 U.S. card acquisitions of $391 million in 2012 contributed to the reduction in the average yield on interest-earning assets. The decrease in the average yield on interest-earnings assets was partially offset by a reduction in our cost of funds. We have continued to benefit from the shift in the mix of our funding to lower cost consumer and commercial banking deposits from higher cost wholesale sources and a decline in deposit interest rates as a result of the continued overall low interest rate environment. 58 Table of Contents Table 3 displays the change in our net interest income between periods and the extent to which the variance is attributable to: (i) changes in the volume of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities or (ii) changes in the interest rates related to these assets and liabilities. Table 3: Rate/Volume Analysis of Net Interest Income (1) 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 (Dollars in millions) Total Variance Volume Rate Total Variance Volume Rate Interest income: Loans: Credit card $ 726 $ 408 $ 318 $ 2,524 $ 2,572 $ (48 ) Consumer banking (88 ) 37 (125 ) 1,168 2,626 (1,458 ) Commercial banking 59 190 (131 ) 46 214 (168 ) Other (19 ) 4 (23 ) 27 (7 ) 34 Total loans, including loans held for sale 678 639 39 3,765 5,405 (1,640 ) Investment securities 246 147 99 192 445 (253 ) Cash equivalents and other interest-earning assets 10 (35 ) 45 20 20 Total interest income 934 751 183 3,977 5,870 (1,893 ) Interest expense: Deposits (162 ) 33 (195 ) 216 635 (419 ) Securitized debt obligations (88 ) (61 ) (27 ) (151 ) (127 ) (24 ) Senior and subordinated notes (30 ) 41 (71 ) 45 56 (11 ) Other borrowings (303 ) 44 (347 ) 19 158 (139 ) Total interest expense (583 ) 57 (640 ) 129 722 (593 ) Net interest income $ 1,517 $ 694 $ 823 $ 3,848 $ 5,148 $ (1,300 ) (1) We calculate the change in interest income and interest expense separately for each item. The change in net interest income attributable to both volume and rates is allocated based on the relative dollar amount of each item. Non-Interest Income Non-interest income primarily consists of service charges and other customer-related fees, interchange income (net of rewards expense), other non-interest income and, in 2012, the bargain purchase gain attributable to the ING Direct acquisition in the amount of $594 million. Other non-interest income includes the pre-tax provision for home loan representation and warranty related to continuing operations. It also includes gains and losses from the sale of investment securities, gains and losses on derivatives not accounted for in hedge accounting relationships and hedge ineffectiveness, which we generally do not allocate to our business segments because they relate to centralized asset/liability and market risk management activities undertaken by our Corporate Treasury group. 59 Table of Contents Table 4 displays the components of non-interest income for 2013, 2012 and 2011. Table 4: Non-Interest Income Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2013 2012 2011 Service charges and other customer-related fees $ 2,118 $ 2,106 $ 1,979 Interchange fees, net 1,896 1,647 1,318 Bargain purchase gain (1) 594 Net other-than-temporary impairment (41 ) (52 ) (21 ) Other non-interest income: (Provision) benefit for mortgage representation and warranty (2) 24 (42 ) (43 ) Net gains from the sale of investment securities 7 45 259 Net fair value gains (losses) on free-standing derivatives (3)(4) 3 (36 ) (197 ) Other (5) 271 545 243 Other non-interest income 305 512 262 Total non-interest income $ 4,278 $ 4,807 $ 3,538 (1) Represents the amount by which the fair value of the net assets acquired in the ING Direct acquisition, as of the acquisition date exceeded the consideration transferred. (2) Represents mortgage representation and warranty provision related to continuing operations. We recorded a total provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses of $309 million, $349 million and $212 million for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The remaining portion of the provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses is included, net of tax, in discontinued operations. (3) Excludes changes in cumulative credit risk valuation adjustments related to derivatives in a gain position. Credit risk valuation adjustments for derivative assets totaled $7 million, $9 million and $23 million as of December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. See Note 10 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities for additional information. (4) Includes mark-to-market derivative losses of $78 million and $277 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively, related to interest-rate swaps we entered into in 2011 to partially hedge the interest rate risk of the net assets associated with the ING Direct acquisition. (5) Other includes derivative hedge ineffectiveness losses of $43 million and $36 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively, and gains of $15 million in 2011. Other also includes income of $162 million in 2012 related to the sale of Visa stock shares. Non-interest income of $4.3 billion in 2013 decreased by $529 million, or 11%, from non-interest income of $4.8 billion in 2012. The decrease in non-interest income reflected the combined impact of the absence of the bargain purchase gain of $594 million recognized at acquisition of ING Direct and income of $162 million from the sale of Visa stock shares, both of which were recorded in 2012. The impact of these items was partially offset by the favorable impact of increased customer related fees and interchange fees from purchase volume growth, due in part to the acquisitions, fee based products and services revenue, a reduction in the provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses and a reduction in fair value losses on free standing derivatives. Non-interest income of $4.8 billion in 2012 increased by $1.3 billion, or 36%, from non-interest income of $3.5 billion in 2011. This increase reflected the combined impact of: (i) the bargain purchase gain of $594 million recorded at acquisition of ING Direct; (ii) increased net interchange and other fees resulting from continued growth and market share from new account originations, due in part to the ING Direct and the 2012 U.S. card acquisitions; (iii) income of $162 million from the sale of Visa stock shares in the first quarter of 2012; and (iv) mark-to-market gains of $85 million recognized on retained interests in mortgage-related securities. The favorable impact of these items was partially offset by expected customer refunds of approximately $115 million related to cross-sell activities in our Domestic Card business, approximately $214 million lower net gains from the sale of available for sale securities recorded in 2012 versus 2011, and a mark-to-market derivative loss of $78 million recognized in the first quarter of 2012 related to the settlement of interest-rate swaps we entered into in 2011 to partially hedge the interest rate risk of the net assets associated with the ING Direct acquisition. 60 Table of Contents Provision for Credit Losses Our provision for credit losses in each period is driven by charge-offs, changes to the allowance for loan and lease losses, and changes to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. We recorded a provision for credit losses of $3.5 billion in 2013, compared with $4.4 billion in 2012 and $2.4 billion in 2011. The provision for credit losses as a percentage of net interest income was 19.1%, 26.6%, and 18.5% in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. The decrease in the provision for credit losses of $962 million in 2013 from 2012 was driven by the absence of the provision for credit losses of $1.2 billion recorded in the second quarter of 2012 to establish an allowance for credit card loans acquired in the 2012 U.S. card acquisition, and lower provision for credit losses in our non-acquired portfolio as underlying credit has improved. This was partially offset by (i) an increase in charge offs on the portfolio of Acquired Loans, as the Acquired Loans have run-off and have been replaced with originated loans which do not have a credit mark to absorb the charge-offs (ii) lower allowance release in our Commercial Banking business due to stabilization of the credit outlook in the current year compared to 2012, and (iii) higher charge offs on our Auto portfolio in our Consumer Banking segment reflecting portfolio growth and increased charge off rates from historically low levels. The increase in the provision for credit losses of $2.0 billion in 2012 from 2011 was primarily related to the addition of the $26.2 billion in outstanding receivables acquired in the 2012 U.S. card acquisition designated as held for investment that had existing revolving privileges at acquisition. These loans were recorded at a fair value of $26.9 billion, resulting in a net premium of $705 million at acquisition, and we recorded an allowance of $1.2 billion for these loans. We provide additional information on the provision for credit losses and changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses under the Credit Risk Profile Summary of Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses , Note 4 Loans and Note 5 Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses. For information on the allowance methodology for each of our loan categories, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Non-Interest Expense Non-interest expense consists of ongoing operating costs, such as salaries and associate benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, professional services, communications and data processing technology expenses and other miscellaneous expenses. Non-interest expense also includes marketing costs, merger-related expense and amortization of intangibles. Table 5 displays the components of non-interest expense for 2013, 2012 and 2011. Table 5: Non-Interest Expense Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2013 2012 2011 Salaries and associate benefits $ 4,432 $ 3,876 $ 3,023 Occupancy and equipment 1,504 1,327 1,025 Marketing 1,373 1,364 1,337 Professional services 1,303 1,270 1,198 Communications and data processing 885 778 681 Amortization of intangibles 671 609 222 Acquisition-related 193 336 45 Other non-interest expense: Collections 470 544 563 Fraud losses 218 190 122 Bankcard, regulatory and other fee assessments 562 525 394 Other 903 1,127 722 Other non-interest expense 2,153 2,386 1,801 Total non-interest expense $ 12,514 $ 11,946 $ 9,332 61 Table of Contents Non-interest expense of $12.5 billion in 2013 increased by $568 million, or 5%, from 2012. The increase reflected higher operating expenses attributable to the acquired businesses and the growth in our auto loan and commercial loan portfolios. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in acquisition-related costs and other non-interest expenses. Non-interest expense of $11.9 billion for 2012 increased $2.6 billion, or 28%, from 2011. The increase was primarily due to higher operating expenses and merger-related costs related to our recent acquisitions, increased salaries and associate benefits attributable to increased headcount, higher infrastructure costs attributable to acquired businesses and our continued investment in our auto loan business and increased amortization of intangibles resulting from the ING Direct and 2012 U.S. card acquisitions. We recorded PCCR intangible amortization expense related to the 2012 U.S. card acquisition of $350 million in 2012. We recorded other intangible amortization expense related to the ING Direct and 2012 U.S. card acquisitions of $147 million in 2012. Income Taxes We recorded an income tax provision of $2.0 billion (31.6% effective income tax rate) in 2013, compared with an income tax provision of $1.3 billion (25.8% effective income tax rate) in 2012 and income tax provision of $1.3 billion (29.1% effective income tax rate) in 2011. Our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations varies between periods due, in part, to fluctuations in our pre-tax earnings, which affects the relative tax benefit of tax-exempt income, tax credits and other permanent tax items. The increase in our effective income tax rate in 2013 from 2012 was primarily attributable to increased pre-tax income, which reduced the relative benefit of tax-exempt income, tax credits and other permanent items, and the absence of discrete tax benefits of $251 million recorded in 2012 for the non-taxable bargain purchase gain of $594 million related to the acquisition of ING Direct, a deferred tax benefit for changes in our state tax position resulting from the 2012 U.S. card acquisition and consolidation of ING Bank, fsb with our existing banking operations, and the resolution of certain tax issues and audits. In comparison, we recorded $16 million of discrete tax expense in 2013 primarily related to adjustments to acquired tax attributes based upon the final tax returns filed, changes to enacted statutory tax rates, and resolution of certain tax issues and audits. The decrease in our effective income tax rate in 2012 from 2011 was primarily attributable to the recording of the discrete tax benefits of $251 million described above in 2012. In comparison, in 2011 we recorded discrete tax benefits of $121 million, primarily related to the release of valuation allowances against certain state deferred tax assets and net operating loss carry-forwards, as well as the resolution of certain tax issues and audits. Our effective income tax rate, excluding the impact of discrete tax items discussed above, was 31.4%, 30.7% and 31.7% in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. The higher effective income tax rate before discrete items in 2013 and 2011 in comparison to 2012 was primarily due to lower affordable housing and other business tax credits as a percentage of pre-tax earnings. We provide additional information on items affecting our income taxes and effective tax rate under Note 17 Income Taxes. Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax Loss from discontinued operations reflects ongoing costs, which primarily consist of mortgage loan repurchase representation and warranty charges related to the mortgage origination operations of GreenPoint wholesale mortgage banking unit that we closed in 2007. We recorded a loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $233 million, $217 million and $106 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The variance in the loss from discontinued operations is attributable to the 62 Table of Contents provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses. We recorded a total pre-tax provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses of $309 million, $349 million and $212 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The portion of these amounts included in loss from discontinued operations totaled $333 million ($210 million net of tax) in 2013, $307 million ($194 million net of tax) in 2012 and $169 million ($120 million net of tax) in 2011. We provide additional information on the provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses and the related reserve for potential representation and warranty claims in Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis Potential Mortgage Representation and Warranty Liabilities and Note 20 Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees, and Others. BUSINESS SEGMENT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE Our principal operations are currently organized into three major business segments, which are defined based on the products and services provided or the type of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability management by our centralized Corporate Treasury group, are included in the Other category. The results of our individual businesses, which we report on a continuing operations basis, reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources. Our business segment results are intended to reflect each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. We use an internal management and reporting process to derive our business segment results. Our internal management and reporting process employs various allocation methodologies, including funds transfer pricing, to assign certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses directly or indirectly attributable to each business segment. Total interest income and net fees are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported. The net interest income of each segment reflects the results of our funds transfer pricing process, which is primarily based on a matched maturity method that takes into consideration market rates. Our funds transfer pricing process provides a funds credit for sources of funds, such as deposits generated by our Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking businesses, and a funds charge for the use of funds by each segment. The allocation process is unique to each business segment and acquired businesses. We may periodically change our business segments or reclassify business segment results based on modifications to our management reporting methodologies and changes in organizational alignment. In the first quarter of 2012, we re-aligned the loan categories reported by our Commercial Banking business and the loan customer and product types included within each category. As a result of this re-alignment, we now report three product categories: commercial and multifamily real estate, commercial and industrial loans and small-ticket commercial real estate, which is a run-off portfolio. We previously reported four categories within our Commercial Banking business: commercial and multifamily real estate, middle market, specialty lending and small-ticket commercial real estate. Middle market and specialty lending related products are included in commercial and industrial loans. All affordable housing tax-related investments, some of which were previously included in the Other segment, are now included in the commercial and multifamily real estate category of our Commercial Banking business. Prior period amounts have been recast to conform to the current period presentation. We refer to the business segment results derived from our internal management accounting and reporting process as our managed presentation, which differs in some cases from our reported results prepared based on U.S. GAAP. There is no comprehensive, authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to U.S. GAAP; therefore, the managed presentation of our business segment results may not be comparable to similar information provided by other financial service companies. In addition, our individual business segment results should not be used as a substitute for comparable results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 63 Table of Contents Below we summarize our business segment results for 2013, 2012 and 2011 and provide a comparative discussion of these results. We also discuss changes in our financial condition and credit performance statistics as of December 31, 2013, compared with December 31, 2012. We provide additional information on the allocation methodologies used to derive our business segment results and a reconciliation of our total business segment results to our reported consolidated results in Note 19 Business Segments. We provide information on the outlook for each of our business segments is presented above under Executive Summary and Business Outlook. Credit Card Business The primary sources of revenue for our Credit Card business are interest income, fees collected from customers and interchange fees. Expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating costs such as salaries and associate benefits, occupancy and equipment, professional services, communications and data processing technology expenses, as well as marketing expenses. Rewards costs are generally netted against interchange fees. Our Credit Card business generated net income from continuing operations of $2.6 billion, $1.5 billion and $2.3 billion in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. On September 6, 2013, we completed the Portfolio Sale. We received $6.4 billion for the net portfolio assets and recognized $26 million of lower of cost or fair value adjustments related to the portfolio assets. Table 6 summarizes the financial results of our Credit Card business, which is comprised of Domestic Card, including installment loans, and International Card, and displays selected key metrics for the periods indicated.

(1) We recognize billed finance charges and fee income on open-ended loans in accordance with the contractual provisions of the credit arrangements and estimate the uncollectible amount on a quarterly basis. The estimated uncollectible amount of billed finance charges and fees is reflected as a reduction in revenue and is not included in our net charge-offs. Total net revenue was reduced by $796 million, $937 million and $371 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, for the estimated uncollectible amount of billed finance charges and fees. The finance charge and fee reserve totaled $190 million and $307 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. (2) Credit card period-end loans held for investment and average loans held for investment include accrued finance charges and fees, net of the estimated uncollectible amount. (3) Calculated by dividing interest income for the period by average loans held for investment during the period for the specified loan category. Interest income also includes interest income on loans held for sale. The transfer of Best Buy loan portfolio from loans held for investment to loans held for sale resulted in an increase in the average yield for the Total Credit Card business of 90 basis points in 2013. (4) Calculated by dividing total net revenue for the period by average loans held for investment during the period for the specified loan category. Interest income also includes interest income on loans held for sale. The transfer of Best Buy loan portfolio from loans held for investment to loans held for sale resulted in an increase in the net revenue margin for the Total Credit Card business of 100 basis points in 2013. (5) Calculated by dividing net charge-offs for the period by average loans held for investment during the period for the specified loan category. The net charge-off rate for 2012 reflects a cumulative adjustment we made in November 2012 related to the timing of charge- offs for delinquent U.K. loans for which revolving privileges have been revoked as part of a loan workout. We previously charged off such loans in the period the account became 180 days past due. Effective November 2012, we began charging off these loans in the period that the account becomes 120 days past due, consistent with our charge-off practice for installment loans. (6) Represents the net reduction in interest income attributable to the amortization of premiums on purchased loans accounted for based on contractual cash flows and the accretion of other intangibles associated with the 2012 U.S. card acquisition. (7) Consists of purchase transactions, net of returns for the period for both loans classified as held for investment and loans classified as held for sale. Excludes cash advance and balance transfer transactions. (8) Calculated by dividing 30+ day performing delinquent loans as of the end of the period by the period-end loans held for investment. (9) Calculated by dividing 30+ day delinquent loans as of the end of the period by period-end loans held for investment. (10) Calculated by dividing nonperforming loans as of the end of the period by period-end loans held for investment. Nonperforming credit card loans generally include international card loans that are 90 or 120 days delinquent. (11) Calculated by dividing the allowance for loan and lease losses as of the end of the period by period-end loans held for investment. The completion of the 2012 U.S. card acquisition in May 2012 along with the transfer of the Best Buy loan portfolio to held for sale from held for investment and subsequent Portfolio Sale in 2013 were the most significant drivers of changes in the financial performance of our Credit Card business for 2013 compared with 2012. Our Credit Card business results for 2013 reflect the full impact of the addition of loans from the acquisition, while 2012 results reflect only a partial period impact of the loans acquired in the 2012 U.S. card acquisition. In addition, our Credit Card business results for 2013 reflect the absence of the provision for credit losses of $1.2 billion to establish an allowance for the credit card receivables acquired in the 2012 U.S. card acquisition and the absence of the charge of $174 million to establish a reserve for estimated uncollectible billed finance charges and fees related to these loans, both of which were recorded in the first half of 2012, as well as a reduction in the provision for credit losses for the transferred Best Buy loan portfolio as charge-offs of finance charges, fee and principal are reflected in the carrying value of loans classified as held for sale. Key factors affecting the results of our Credit Card business for 2013, compared with 2012, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 include the following: Net Interest Income : Net interest income increased by $785 million, or 8%, in 2013 to $11.0 billion from $10.2 billion in 2012. The increase in net interest income is primarily driven by (i) higher average yield on 65 Table of Contents loans held for investment, (ii) the increase in interest and non interest income in 2013 due to the full year impact of 2012 U.S. card acquisition, and (iii) the absence of the charge recorded in the second quarter of 2012 to establish the finance charge and fee reserve for the loans acquired in the 2012 U.S card acquisition. The higher average yield on loans held for investment was driven largely by the transfer of the Best Buy loan portfolio to the loans held for sale category in the first quarter of 2013. This was partially offset by a decrease in average loans held for investment due to the Portfolio Sale and expected continued run-off of our installment loan portfolio and other credit card loans acquired in the 2012 U.S. card acquisition. Non-Interest Income : Non-interest income increased by $242 million, or 8% in 2013 to $3.3 billion from $3.1 billion in 2012. The increase was primarily driven by higher net interchange fees from growth in purchase volume due in part to the 2012 U.S. card acquisition. Purchase volume increased by $20.5 billion, or 11%, in 2013. Other factors include increased customer-related fees from the addition of acquired credit card accounts and the absence of charges incurred in the first and second quarters of 2012 for expected refunds to customers affected by certain cross-sell sales practices in our Domestic Card business. Provision for Credit Losses : The provision for credit losses related to our Credit Card business decreased by $1.3 billion to $2.8 billion in 2013, from $4.1 billion in 2012. The decrease was primarily driven by the absence of the provision for credit losses of $1.2 billion recorded in the second quarter of 2012 to establish an allowance for credit card loans acquired in the 2012 U.S. card acquisition. Non-Interest Expense : Non-interest expense increased by $585 million, or 9%, in 2013 to $7.4 billion from $6.9 billion in 2012. The increase was largely due to higher operating expenses resulting from the 2012 U.S. card acquisition. This includes PCCR intangible amortization expense of $434 million in 2013, compared with $350 million in 2012. Loans Held for Investment: Period-end loans held for investment in our Credit Card business decreased by $10.5 billion, or 11% as of December 31, 2013. The decrease was due in part to the Portfolio Sale in 2013, as well as the expected continued run-off of our installment loan portfolio and certain other credit card loans acquired in the 2012 U.S. card acquisition partially offset by growth in certain other credit card segments. Charge-off and Delinquency Statistics: Our reported net charge-off rate increased to 4.15% in 2013, from 3.68% in 2012. The 30+ day delinquency rate decreased to 3.54% as of December 31, 2013, from 3.69% as of December 31, 2012. The increase in reported net charge-off rates in 2013 were largely due to the impact of charge-offs from the 2012 U.S. card acquisition which was recorded at fair value. Charges offs are recorded on Acquired Loans when the nonaccretable difference on the loans are reduced to zero. Charge offs related to the 2012 U.S. card acquisition were included in the numerator in calculating our net charge-off rates in 2013. Key factors affecting the results of our Credit Card business for 2012, compared with 2011, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 include the following: Net Interest Income : Net interest income increased by $2.4 billion, or 30%, in 2012, primarily attributable to the substantial increase in average loans held for investment resulting from the 2012 U.S. card acquisition in the second quarter of 2012, which was partially offset by a modest reduction in average loan yields due to the establishment of a finance charge and fee reserve for the loans acquired in the 2012 U.S. card acquisition and net premium amortization related to these loans. Non-Interes t Income : Non-interest income increased by $469 million, or 18%, in 2012. The increase was primarily driven by higher net interchange fees generated from purchase volume growth and customer-related fees resulting from the addition of customer accounts associated with the 2012 U.S. card acquisition in the second quarter of 2012. This increase was partially offset by charges of approximately $115 million expected refunds to customers affected by certain cross-sell activities in our Domestic Card business and the discontinuance of revenue recognition for billings to customers affected by the cross-sell activities. 66 Table of Contents Provision for Credit Losses : The provision for credit losses related to our Credit Card business increased to $4.1 billion in 2012, from $1.9 billion in 2011. The significant increase in the provision in 2012 was primarily driven by the provision of $1.2 billion recorded in the second quarter of 2012 to establish an allowance for the receivables acquired in the 2012 U.S. card acquisition with revolving privileges. We recorded an additional provision for credit losses for these loans of $107 million in the second half of 2012. The provision for credit losses, excluding the allowance build related to the receivables acquired in the 2012 U.S. card acquisition, totaled $2.8 billion in 2012, reflecting a relative stabilization in credit performance improvement compared to significant credit performance improvement in 2011 that resulted in a large allowance release of $1.2 billion in 2011. Non-Interest Expense : Non-interest expense increased by $1.8 billion, or 36%, in 2012. The increase was largely due to higher operating expenses resulting from the 2012 U.S. card acquisition and the amortization of intangibles and other assets associated with the 2012 U.S. card acquisition, including PCCR intangible amortization expense of $350 million in 2012. Other items contributing to the increase in non-interest expense include merger-related expenses associated with the 2012 U.S. card acquisition, expense of $75 million recognized in the first quarter of 2012 for expected customer refunds attributable to issues associated with cross-selling certain other products to credit card customers, regulatory fines of $60 million related to cross-sell activities in the Domestic Card business and expense of $98 million for net litigation reserves to cover interchange and other legal matters in the second quarter of 2012. Total Loans : Period-end loans in our Credit Card business increased by $26.7 billion, or 41%, in 2012, to $91.8 billion as of December 31, 2012. The increase was primarily due to the addition of the $27.8 billion in outstanding receivables acquired in the 2012 U.S. card acquisition classified as held for investment. Excluding the addition of these receivables, period-end loans held for investment decreased by $1.1 billion, or 2%, due to the expected continued run-off of our installment loan portfolio as well as the expected run-off of higher-margin, higher-loss receivables acquired in the 2012 U.S. card acquisition. Charge-off and Delinquency Statistics : Our reported net charge-off rate decreased to 3.68% in 2012, from 4.92% in 2011. Our reported charge-offs reflect the absence of charge-offs for the receivables acquired in the 2012 U.S. card acquisition accounted for based on estimated cash flows expected to be collected over the life of the loans. Charges offs are recorded on Acquired Loans when the nonaccretable difference on the loans are reduced to zero. The decrease in the net-charge off rates was also due in part to the addition of loans acquired in the 2012 U.S. card acquisition to the denominator in calculating our reported charge-off rates. The 30+ day delinquency rate decreased to 3.69% as of December 31, 2012, from 3.86% as of December 31, 2011. Domestic Card Business Domestic Card generated net income from continuing operations of $2.4 billion in 2013, compared with net income from continuing operations of $1.4 billion in 2012 and $2.3 billion in 2011. Domestic Card accounted for 90% of total revenues for our Credit Card business in 2013 compared with 89% in 2012 and 87% in 2011. Income attributable to Domestic Card represented 91% of income for our Credit Card business in 2013, compared with 92% in 2012 and 102% in 2011. 67 Table of Contents Table 6.1 summarizes the financial results for Domestic Card and displays selected key metrics for the periods indicated.

Because our Domestic Card business accounts for the substantial majority of our Credit Card business, the key factors driving the results for this division are similar to the key factors affecting our total Credit Card business. The primary drivers of the improvement in results for our Domestic Card business in 2013, compared with 2012 included: (i) higher interest income primarily driven by higher average yield on loans held for investment driven largely by the transfer of the Best Buy loan portfolio to the held for sale category in the first quarter of 2013, as well as the absence of the charge recorded in the second quarter of 2012 to establish the finance charge and fee reserve for the acquired credit card loans; (ii) the increase in interest and non interest income in 2013 due to the full year impact of 2012 U.S. card acquisition and (iii) the absence of provision for credit losses of $1.2 billion recorded in the second quarter of 2012 to establish an allowance for acquired credit card loans. These impacts were partially offset by higher operating expenses attributable to the addition of loans and increased amortization of intangibles and other assets associated with the 2012 U.S. card acquisition. Domestic Card generated net income from continuing operations of $1.4 billion in 2012, compared with net income from continuing operations of $2.3 billion in 2011. The decrease in Domestic Card net income in 2012 from 2011 reflected an increase in total net revenue largely due to the addition of loans from the 2012 U.S. card acquisition, which was more than offset by the unfavorable impact of several items related to the 2012 U.S. card acquisition. These items included: (i) a significant increase in the provision for credit losses resulting from an initial allowance build of $1.2 billion related to the portfolio purchased in the 2012 U.S. card acquisition; and (ii) an increase in non-interest expense largely resulting from operating expenses related to the 2012 U.S. card acquisition and the amortization of intangibles and other assets associated with the 2012 U.S. card acquisition, including PCCR intangible amortization expense of $350 million in 2012. International Card Business International Card generated net income from continuing operations of $234 million in 2013, compared with net income from continuing operations of $126 million in 2012 and a net loss from continuing operations of $51 million in 2011. International Card accounted for 10% of total net revenues for our Credit Card business in 2013, compared with 11% in 2012 and 13% in 2011. Income attributable to International Card represented 9% of income for our Credit Card business in 2013, compared with 8% of the net income for 2012. Our International Card business posted a loss that represented 2% of income for our Credit Card business in 2011. 69 Table of Contents Table 6.2 summarizes the financial results for International Card and displays selected key metrics for the periods indicated.

(3) Calculated by dividing total net revenue for the period by average loans held for investment during the period. (4) Calculated by dividing net charge-offs for the period by average loans held for investment during the period. The net charge-off rate for 2012 reflects a cumulative adjustment we made in November 2012 related to the timing of charge-offs for delinquent U.K. loans for which revolving privileges have been revoked as part of a loan workout. We previously charged off such loans in the period the account became 180 days past due. Effective November 2012, we began charging off these loans in the period that the account becomes 120 days past due, consistent with our charge-off practice for installment loans.

Nonperforming credit card loans include international card loans that are generally 90 or 120 days delinquent. 70 Table of Contents Our International Card business generated net income from continuing operations of $234 million in 2013, compared with net income from continuing operations of $126 million in 2012. The primary drivers of the improvement in results for our International Card business in 2013, compared with 2012 included: (i) the absence of charges recorded in the second quarter of 2012 associated with refunds to U.K. customers due to retrospective regulatory requirements pertaining to Payment Protection Insurance, which had an unfavorable impact on total net revenue and non-interest expense in 2012, and (ii) a reduction in the provision for credit losses attributable to lower net charge-offs, reflecting the improvement in the credit environment in Canada and the U.K. Our International Card business generated net income from continuing operations of $126 million in 2012, compared with a net loss from continuing operations of $51 million in 2011. The International Card net income in 2012, compared with net loss in 2011, was driven by a decrease in the provision for credit losses, attributable to lower net charge-offs resulting from credit improvement in Canada and the U.K., and the absence of an allowance build of $105 million for the Hudson Bay Corporation loan portfolio we acquired in January 2011. Consumer Banking Business The primary sources of revenue for our Consumer Banking business are net interest income from loans and deposits and non-interest income from customer fees. Expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, ongoing operating costs, such as salaries and associate benefits, occupancy and equipment, professional services, communications and data processing technology expenses, as well as marketing expenses. Our Consumer Banking business generated net income from continuing operations of $1.5 billion in 2013, compared with net income from continuing operations of $1.4 billion in 2012 and $809 million in 2011. Our results primarily reflect an increase in average balances in our auto portfolio offset by lower yields. This was partially offset by declining average balances and yields in our home loan portfolio. On February 17, 2012, we acquired ING Direct, which resulted in the addition of loans with carrying value of $40.4 billion and deposits of $84.4 billion at acquisition. The substantial majority of the lending and retail deposit businesses acquired are reported in our Consumer Banking business; however, the results of our Consumer Banking business for the first quarter of 2012 reflect only a partial-quarter impact from the operations of ING Direct. 71 Table of Contents Table 7 summarizes the financial results of our Consumer Banking business and displays selected key metrics for the periods indicated.

Key factors affecting the results of our Consumer Banking business for 2013, compared with 2012, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 include the following: Net Interest Income: Net interest income increased by $117 million, or 2%, in 2013 to $5.9 billion from $5.8 billion in 2012. The increase in net interest income is primarily attributable to growth in our auto loans, partially offset by lower auto and deposits margins. While average loan balances have grown in 2013 as compared to 2012, we have continued to see a decline in gross interest income due to overall lower average yields on loans. The decrease in auto yields is primarily attributable to a shift in the credit quality mix of our portfolio, as well as increased competition in the marketplace. The average yield on auto loans for 2013 was 9.8%, as compared to 11.0% in 2012. The decrease in home loans was largely driven by the continued expected run-off of the acquired home loans portfolio. The average yield on home loans was 3.4% in 2013 compared to 3.6% in 2012. Average deposit balances increased to $169.7 billion in 2013 from $162.6 billion in 2012, while the average deposit interest rate declined to 0.63% in 2013 from 0.70% in 2012. We expect the yields in our Consumer Banking business to continue to decline as we face increased competition in auto loans, the continued shift to higher credit quality in our auto loan portfolio, and continued deposit rate compression. Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income decreased by $33 million, or 4%, to $749 million in 2013 from $782 million in 2012 related to the mark-to-market gains on retained interests in interest-only strips and negative amortization mortgage securities recognized in the third quarter of 2012. Provision for Credit Losses: The provision for credit losses increased by $67 million or 11% in 2013 to $656 million, reflecting higher auto loan charge-offs attributable to auto portfolio growth and an increase in the auto charge-off rate from historically low levels. As discussed above under Summary of Selected Financial Data, the substantial majority of the ING Direct home loan portfolio is accounted for based on estimated cash flows expected to be collected over the life of the loans. Because accounting based on estimated cash flows takes into consideration future credit losses expected to be incurred, charge-offs are not recorded until the expected credit losses within the nonaccretable difference is depleted. Non-Interest Expense : Non-interest expense decreased by $126 million, or 3%, in 2013 to $3.7 billion. The decrease was largely due to the absence of ING Direct acquisition-related costs and other one-time items incurred in 2012, which were partially offset by increased expenses related to the growth in our auto loan portfolio. 73 Table of Contents Loans Held for Investment : Period-end loans held for investment in our Consumer Banking business declined by $4.4 billion, or 6%, in 2013, to $70.8 billion as of December 31, 2013, due to the continued expected run-off of acquired home loans, partially offset by higher period-end auto loan balances due to the continued high volume of auto loan originations. Deposits : Period-end deposits in our Consumer Banking business declined by $4.7 billion, or 3%, in 2013 to $167.7 billion as of December 31, 2013, primarily due to the expected run-off of our legacy National Direct Bank deposits. Charge-off and Delinquency Statistics : The reported net charge-off rate increased to 0.85% in 2013, from 0.74% in 2012. The 30+ day delinquency rate increased to 3.89% as of December 31, 2013, from 3.34% as of December 31, 2012. The increase in the net charge-off rates reflect moderately higher auto loan charge-offs, partially offset by improved home loan performance. The overall delinquency rates increased moderately largely due to the run-off of the acquired home loans, which were included in the denominator in calculating the delinquency rates. Key factors affecting the results of our Consumer Banking business for 2012, compared with 2011, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 include the following: Net Interest Income : Net interest income increased by $1.6 billion, or 37%, in 2012. The increase was primarily attributable to the addition of home loans from the ING Direct acquisition, continued growth and strong margin performance in our auto loan portfolio and the addition of low-rate deposits from the ING Direct acquisition. With the addition of deposits from ING Direct, average deposits increased to $162.6 billion in 2012, from $86.9 billion in 2011, while the average deposit interest rate fell to 0.70% in 2012, from 0.96% in 2011. The favorable impact from these items was modestly offset by the expected run-off of acquired home loans. Non-Interest Income : Non-interest income increased by $62 million, or 9%, in 2012. The increase was primarily attributable to mark-to-market gains on retained interests in interest-only strips and negative amortization mortgage securities recognized in the third quarter of 2012. Provision for Credit Losses : The provision for credit losses increased by $137 million in 2012 to $589 million. The increase was largely due to higher auto loan balances, which more than offset the benefit from lower net charge-off rates and continued credit performance improvement. We recorded an allowance build of $59 million in 2012, compared with an allowance release of $23 million in 2011. Non-Interest Expense : Non-interest expense increased by $627 million, or 19%, in 2012. The increase was largely attributable to operating expenses related to ING Direct, merger-related expenses associated with the acquisition and higher infrastructure expenditures resulting from continued investments in the home loan business and growth in auto loan balances as a result of increased auto loan originations. Loans Held for Investment : Period-end loans in the Consumer Banking business increased by $38.8 billion, or 107%, in 2012 to $75.1 billion as of December 31, 2012, primarily due to the acquisition of $40.4 billion of ING Direct home loans and growth in auto loan originations, which were partially offset by the expected continued run-off of our acquired home loan portfolios. Deposits : Period-end deposits in the Consumer Banking business increased by $83.9 billion, or 95%, in 2012 to $172.4 billion as of December 31, 2012, primarily due to the addition of ING Direct deposits of $84.4 billion. Charge-off and Delinquency Statistics : The net charge-off rate decreased to 0.74% in 2012, from 1.39% in 2011. The 30+ day delinquency rate decreased to 3.34% as of December 31, 2012, from 5.99% as of December 31, 2011. The improvement in our reported net charge-off and delinquency rates for our Consumer Banking business reflects the impact of the addition of the ING Direct home loan portfolio. The overall improvement in credit quality metrics, excluding Acquired Loans, reflects improved credit performance in our legacy consumer loan portfolios. 74 Table of Contents Commercial Banking Business The primary sources of revenue for our Commercial Banking business are net interest income from loans and deposits and non-interest income from customer fees. Because we have some affordable housing tax-related investments that generate tax-exempt income or tax credits, we make certain reclassifications to our Commercial Banking business results to present revenues on a taxable-equivalent basis. Expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, ongoing operating costs, such as salaries and associate benefits, occupancy and equipment, professional services, communications and data processing technology expenses, as well as marketing expenses. Our Commercial Banking business generated net income from continuing operations of $769 million in 2013, compared with net income from continuing operations of $835 million in 2012 and $595 million in 2011. On November 1, 2013, we acquired Beech Street Capital, a privately-held, national originator and servicer of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and FHA multifamily commercial real estate loans. The Beech Street Capital results are reported within the Commercial Banking business.

Key factors affecting the results of our Commercial Banking business for 2013, compared with 2012, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 include the following: Net Interest Income: Net interest income increased by $155 million, or 9%, in 2013 to $1.9 billion. The increase was primarily driven by growth in our commercial lending business and higher deposit balances. Non-Interest Income : Non-interest income increased by $55 million, or 16%, in 2013 to $395 million, driven by increased revenue related to fee-based products and services from the Beech Street Capital acquisition. Provision for Credit Losses : The Commercial Banking business recorded a benefit related to the provision for credit losses of $24 million in 2013, compared with a benefit of $270 million in 2012. The stabilization of the credit outlook has resulted in less allowance release in the current year when compared to the prior year. The combined release for allowance and reserve for unfunded lending commitments was $43 million in 2013, compared with a release of $313 million in 2012. Non-Interest Expense : Non-interest expense increased by $60 million, or 6%, in 2013 to $1.1 billion, driven by investments in business growth and infrastructure enhancements and the costs associated with Beech Street Capital. Loans Held for Investment : Period-end loans held for investment in our Commercial Banking business increased by $6.2 billion, or 16%, in 2013, to $45.0 billion as of December 31, 2013. The increase was 76 Table of Contents driven by strong loan originations in the commercial lending business, which was partially offset by the continued run-off of the small-ticket commercial real estate loan portfolio. Deposits : Period-end deposits in the Commercial Banking business increased by $701 million, or 2%, to $30.6 billion as of December 31, 2013, from $29.9 billion as of December 31, 2012, driven by our strategy to strengthen existing relationships and increase liquidity from commercial customers. Charge-off Statistics : The net charge-off rate was 0.03% in 2013, compared to 0.12% in 2012. The nonperforming loan rate decreased to 0.33% as of December 31, 2013, from 0.73% as of December 31, 2012. The continued strength in the credit metrics in our Commercial Banking business reflected stable credit trends and underlying collateral values. Key factors affecting the results of our Commercial Banking business for 2012, compared with 2011, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 include the following: Net Interest Income : Net interest income increased by $144 million, or 9%, in 2012. The increase was primarily driven by higher deposit balances and growth in commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans. Non-Interest Income : Non-interest income increased by $57 million or 20%, in 2012, largely attributable to growth in fees from services provided to customers. Provision for Credit Losses : The Commercial Banking business recorded a benefit related to the provision for credit losses of $270 million in 2012, compared with a provision of credit losses of $31 million in 2011. The benefit recorded in 2012 reflected a significant decrease in net charge-offs, resulting in an increase in allowance releases attributable to the improvement in underlying credit performance trends. We recorded a release of the combined allowance for loan losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments of $313 million in 2012, compared with a release of $147 million in 2011. Non-Interest Expense : Non-interest expense increased by $134 million, or 14%, in 2012. The increase was due to costs associated with higher originations in our commercial real estate and commercial and industrial businesses, expansion into new markets and infrastructure investments. Loans Held for Investment : Period-end loans increased by $4.5 billion, or 13%, in 2012 to $38.8 billion as of December 31, 2012. The increase was driven by stronger loan originations in the commercial and industrial and commercial real estate businesses, which was partially offset by the run-off and sale of a portion of the small-ticket commercial real estate loan portfolio. Deposits : Period-end deposits in the Commercial Banking business increased by $3.2 billion, or 12%, in 2012 to $29.9 billion as of December 31, 2012, driven by our strategy to strengthen existing relationships and increase liquidity from commercial customers. Charge-off Statistics : The net charge-off rate decreased to 0.12% in 2012, from 0.57% in 2011. The nonperforming loan rate decreased to 0.73% as of December 31, 2012, from 1.08% as of December 31, 2011. The significant improvement in the credit metrics in our Commercial Banking business reflected a continued improvement in credit trends and strengthening of underlying collateral values, resulting in lower loss severities and opportunities for recoveries on previously charged-off loans. Other Category Other includes unallocated amounts related to our centralized Corporate Treasury group activities, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability management. Gains and losses on our investment securities portfolio and certain trading activities are included in the Other category. The Other category also includes foreign exchange-rate fluctuations related to the revaluation of foreign currency-denominated investments; certain gains and losses on the sale and securitization of loans; unallocated corporate 77 Table of Contents expenses that do not directly support the operations of the business segments or for which the business segments are not considered financially accountable in evaluating their performance, such as certain acquisition and restructuring charges; a portion of the provision for representation and warranty reserves related to continuing operations; certain material items that are non-recurring in nature; and offsets related to certain line-item reclassifications. Net loss from continuing operations recorded in Other was $443 million in 2013, compared with net income from continuing operations of $6 million in 2012 and a net loss from continuing operations of $428 million in 2011. Table 9 summarizes the financial results of our Other category for the periods indicated. Table 9: Other Results Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2013 2012 2011 Selected income statement data: Net interest income (expense) $ (661 ) $ (1,121 ) $ (913 ) Non-interest income (186 ) 607 (74 ) Total net revenue (847 ) (514 ) (987 ) Provision for credit losses (3 ) 35 7 Non-interest expense 211 162 128 Income from continuing operations before income taxes (1,055 ) (711 ) (1,122 ) Income tax benefit (612 ) (717 ) (694 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax $ (443 ) $ 6 $ (428 ) The shift in the Other category to a net loss from continuing operations of $443 million in 2013 from net income from continuing operations of $6 million in 2012 was primarily due to three non-recurring items recognized in 2012 related to the ING Direct acquisition. We recognized a bargain purchase gain of $594 million related to the ING Direct acquisition and an income of $162 million from the sale of Visa stock shares during the first quarter of 2012, which was partially offset by a derivative loss of $78 million recognized in the first quarter of 2012 related to the interest rate swaps we entered into in 2011 to partially hedge the interest rate risk of the net assets associated with the ING Direct acquisition. The Other category shifted to net income from continuing operations of $6 million in 2012, from a net loss of $428 million in 2011. The increase is primarily related to the three non-recurring items described above. CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS ANALYSIS Total assets of $297.0 billion as of December 31, 2013 decreased by $15.9 billion, or 5%, from $312.9 billion as of December 31, 2012. Total liabilities of $255.3 billion as of December 31, 2013, decreased by $17.1 billion, or 6%, from $272.4 billion as of December 31, 2012. Stockholders equity increased by $1.2 billion to $41.7 billion as of December 31, 2013. The increase in stockholders equity was primarily attributable to our net income of $4.2 billion for 2013, which was partially offset by an other comprehensive loss of $1.6 billion, largely attributable to an increase in interest rates in the second half of 2013 that reduced the fair value of our investment securities classified as available for sale and resulted in net unrealized losses. Following is a discussion of material changes in the major components of our assets and liabilities during 2013. Period-end balance sheet amounts may vary from average balance sheet amounts due to liquidity and balance sheet management activities that are intended to ensure the adequacy of capital while managing our ability to manage liquidity requirements for the company and our customers and our market risk exposure in accordance with our risk appetite. 78 Table of Contents Investment Securities Our investment portfolio consists primarily of the following: U.S. Treasury debt, U.S. agency debt and corporate debt securities guaranteed by U.S. government agencies ( Agency ); Agency and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities ( RMBS ) and commercial mortgage-backed securities ( CMBS ); other asset-backed securities ( ABS ) and other investments. The carrying value of our investments in U.S. Treasury, agency securities and other securities guaranteed by the U.S. government or agencies of the U.S. government represented 77% of our total investment securities portfolio as of December 31, 2013 and 2012. Our investment security portfolio includes securities available for sale as well as securities held to maturity. We classify securities as available for sale or held to maturity based on our investment strategy and management assessment of our intent and ability to hold the securities until maturity. We report securities available for sale in our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ). We report securities held to maturity on our consolidated balance sheets at carrying value. Carrying value generally consists of amortized cost. For securities transferred from available for sale to held to maturity, carrying value also includes unrealized gains and losses recognized in AOCI at the date of transfer. Such unrealized gains or losses are accreted over the remaining life of the security with no impact on future net income. During 2013, the fair value of our investment portfolio decreased by $3.0 billion, or 5% from $64.0 billion as of December 31, 2012 to $61.0 billion as of December 31, 2013. The fair value of our securities available for sale portfolio was $41.8 billion as of December 31, 2013, a $22.2 billion decrease from $64.0 billion as a December 31, 2012. This decrease was primarily driven by the transfer of securities available for sale to securities held to maturity with a fair value of $18.3 billion as of the date of the transfer. We transferred these securities to held to maturity in consideration of changes to regulatory capital requirements under the final Basel III capital standards, and to reduce the impact of price volatility on AOCI. The transferred securities included net pre-tax unrealized losses of $1.5 billion at the date of transfer. Excluding the change on the held to maturity securities subsequent to the transfer, the fair value of our securities decreased $4 billion in 2013 driven by the rise in interest rates and normal portfolio activity. During 2012, our portfolio of investment securities available for sale increased by $25.2 billion, or 65%. The increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of ING Direct investment securities of $30.2 billion as of the acquisition date, which was partially offset by the sale of investment securities of approximately $16.9 billion. We recorded a net gain of $45 million from the sale of these securities. We had gross unrealized gains of $799 million and gross unrealized losses of $631 million on available-for sale investment securities as of December 31, 2013, compared with gross unrealized gains of $1.2 billion and gross unrealized losses of $120 million as of December 31, 2012. The increase in gross unrealized losses in 2013 was primarily driven by higher interest rates. Of the $631 million in gross unrealized losses as of December 31, 2013, $109 million related to securities that had been in a loss position for more than 12 months. 79 Table of Contents Table 10 presents the amortized cost, carrying value and fair value for the major categories of our portfolio of investment securities as of December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.

(2) Includes foreign government/agency bonds, covered bonds, corporate securities, municipal securities and equity investments primarily related to activities under the CRA. We provide information on OTTI losses recognized in earnings on our investment securities above under Consolidated Results of Operations Non-Interest Income. 80 Table of Contents Credit Ratings Our portfolio of investment securities continues to be concentrated in securities that generally have low credit risk and high credit ratings, such as securities issued and guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury and other government sponsored enterprises or agencies. Approximately 92% of our total investment securities portfolio was rated AA+ or its equivalent, or better as of both December 31, 2013 and 2012, while approximately 5% and 6% was below investment grade as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We categorize the credit ratings of our investment securities based on the lowest credit rating as issued by the rating agencies Standard & Poor Ratings Services ( S&P ), Moody Investors Service ( Moody ) and Fitch Ratings ( Fitch ). Table 11 provides information on the credit ratings of our non-agency RMBS, non-agency CMBS, other asset-backed securities and other securities in our portfolio as of December 31, 2013 and 2012.

Loans Held for Investment Total loans that we manage consist of held for investment loans recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and loans held in our securitization trusts. Loans underlying our securitization trusts are reported on our consolidated balance sheets in restricted loans for securitization investors. Table 12 summarizes our portfolio of loans held for investment by business segment, net of the allowance for loan and lease losses, as of December 31, 2013 and 2012.

The decrease was due in part to the transfer of the Best Buy loan portfolio of $7 billion at the date of transfer to the loans held for sale in the first quarter of 2013, which were further sold in the third quarter of 2013. In addition to the Portfolio Sale, period-end loans held for investment decreased due to expected run-off of certain other credit card loans acquired in the 2012 U.S. card acquisition and continued expected run-off of installment loans in our Credit Card business and home loans in our Consumer Banking business. The paydowns and run-off of card balances were partially offset by growth in certain segments of our Credit Card business, higher period-end auto loan balances due to the continued high volume of auto loan originations and strong loan originations in our commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loan portfolios. We provide additional information on the composition of our loan portfolio and credit quality below in Credit Risk Profile and in Note 4 Loans. Loans Held for Sale Loans held for sale, which are carried at lower of cost or fair value, increased to $218 million as of December 31, 2013, from $201 million as of December 31, 2012. We provide additional information for loans held for sale in Note 4 Loans. Customer Deposits Our customer deposits have become our largest source of funding for our operations, providing a sizable and consistent source of low-cost funds. Total customer deposits decreased by $8.0 billion to $204.5 billion as of December 31, 2013, from $212.5 billion as of December 31, 2012, reflecting our scaling back of deposit growth in the current environment of relatively low overall loan growth. We provide information on the composition of our deposits, average outstanding balances, interest expense and yield below in Liquidity Risk Profile. Securitized Debt Obligations Securitization debt obligations decreased by $1.1 billion during 2013 to $10.3 billion as of December 31, 2013, from $11.4 billion as of December 31, 2012. The decrease was driven by maturities and repurchases totaling $3.3 billion, partially offset by the issuance of $2.2 billion of credit card securitization debt during 2013. Other Debt Other debt, which consists of federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, senior and subordinated notes and other borrowings, including Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB ) advances, but excluding securitized debt obligations, totaled $30.4 billion as of December 31, 2013, of which $16.2 billion represented short-term borrowings and $14.2 billion represented long-term debt. Other debt decreased by $8.1 billion in 2013 from a total of $38.5 billion as of December 31, 2012, of which $21.1 billion represented short-term borrowings and $17.4 billion represented long-term borrowings. The decrease in other debt was primarily attributable to our redemption of $3.65 billion junior subordinated debt in connection with our redemption of outstanding trust preferred securities in the first quarter of 2013, as well as net maturities of FHLB advances of $4.6 billion during 2013. The above decreases were partially offset by the issuance of $2.0 billion unsecured senior notes during 2013. We provide additional information on our borrowings in Note 9 Deposits and Borrowings. 82 Table of Contents Potential Mortgage Representation & Warranty Liabilities We acquired three subsidiaries that originated residential mortgage loans and sold them to various purchasers, including purchasers who created securitization trusts. These subsidiaries are Capital One Home Loans, which was acquired in February 2005; GreenPoint, which was acquired in December 2006 as part of the North Fork acquisition; and CCB, which was acquired in February 2009 and subsequently merged into CONA. We have established representation and warranty reserves for losses associated with the mortgage loans sold by each subsidiary that we consider to be both probable and reasonably estimable, including both litigation and non-litigation liabilities. These reserves are reported in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other liabilities. The reserve setting process relies heavily on estimates, which are inherently uncertain, and requires the application of judgment. We evaluate these estimates on a quarterly basis. We build our representation and warranty reserves through the provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses, which we report in our consolidated statements of income as a component of non-interest income for loans originated and sold by CCB and Capital One Home Loans and as a component of discontinued operations for loans originated and sold by GreenPoint. In establishing the representation and warranty reserves, we consider a variety of factors depending on the category of purchaser. The aggregate reserves for all three subsidiaries totaled $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2013, compared with $899 million as of December 31, 2012. The table below summarizes changes in our representation and warranty reserves in 2013 and 2012. Table 13: Changes in Representation and Warranty Reserve Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2013 2012 Representation and warranty repurchase reserve, beginning of period (1) $ 899 $ 943 Provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses (2) 309 349 Net realized losses (36 ) (393 ) Representation and warranty repurchase reserve, end of period (1) $ 1,172 $ 899 (1) Reported in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other liabilities. (2) The pre-tax portion of the provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses recognized in our consolidated statements of income as a component of non-interest income was a benefit of $24 million in 2013, compared with a loss of $42 million in 2012. The pre-tax portion of the provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses recognized in our consolidated statements of income as a component of discontinued operations totaled $333 million in 2013 and $307 million in 2012. As part of our business planning processes, we have considered various outcomes relating to the potential future representation and warranty liabilities of our subsidiaries that are possible but do not rise to the level of being both probable and reasonably estimable outcomes justifying an incremental accrual under applicable accounting standards. Our current best estimate of reasonably possible future losses from representation and warranty claims beyond what was in our reserve as of December 31, 2013, is approximately $2.6 billion, a decline from our estimate of $2.7 billion as of December 31, 2012. The estimate as of December 31, 2013 covers all reasonably possible losses relating to representation and warranty claim activity. We provide additional information related to the representation and warranty reserve, including factors that may impact the adequacy of the reserves and the ultimate amount of losses incurred by our subsidiaries, in Note 20 Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees, and Others. 83 Table of Contents OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various types of arrangements with limited liability companies, partnerships or trusts that often involve special purpose entities and variable interest entities ( VIE ). Some of these arrangements are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or may be recorded in amounts different from the full contract or notional amount of the arrangements, depending on the nature or structure of, and accounting required to be applied to, the arrangement. These arrangements may expose us to potential losses in excess of the amounts recorded in the consolidated balance sheets. Our involvement in these arrangements can take many forms, including securitization and servicing activities, the purchase or sale of mortgage-backed or other asset-backed securities in connection with our home loan portfolio and loans to VIEs that hold debt, equity, real estate or other assets. Our continuing involvement in unconsolidated VIEs primarily consists of certain mortgage loan trusts and community reinvestment and development entities. The carrying amount of assets and liabilities of these unconsolidated VIEs was $3.4 billion and $0.5 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2013, and our maximum exposure to loss was $3.9 billion as of December 31, 2013. We provide a discussion of our activities related to these VIEs in Note 6 Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The level and composition of our equity capital are determined by multiple factors, including our consolidated regulatory capital requirements and an internal risk-based capital assessment, and may also be influenced by rating agency guidelines, subsidiary capital requirements, the business environment, conditions in the financial markets and assessments of potential future losses due to adverse changes in our business and market environments. Capital Standards and Prompt Corrective Action Bank holding companies and national banks are subject to capital adequacy standards adopted by the Federal Reserve and the OCC, respectively. The capital adequacy standards set forth minimum risk-based and leverage capital requirements that are based on quantitative and qualitative measures of assets and off-balance sheet items. Under the capital adequacy standards, bank holding companies and national banks currently are required to maintain a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 4% and a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 4% in order to be considered adequately capitalized. National banks also are subject to prompt corrective action ( PCA ) capital regulations. Under PCA regulations, a national bank is considered to be well capitalized if it maintains a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10% (200 basis points higher than the minimum capital standard above), a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6% (200 basis points higher than the minimum capital standard above), a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 5% (100 basis points higher than the minimum capital standard above) and is not subject to any supervisory agreement, order or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. A bank is considered to be adequately capitalized if it meets the above minimum capital standards and does not otherwise meet the well capitalized definition. Currently, PCA capital requirements do not apply to bank holding companies. We also disclose a Tier 1 common ratio for our bank holding company, which is a regulatory capital measure widely used by investors, analysts, rating agencies and bank regulatory agencies to assess the capital position of financial services companies. While there is currently no mandated minimum or well capitalized standard for the Tier 1 common ratio, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC (collectively, the U.S. federal banking agencies) recently finalized a new capital rule (the Final Rule ) that implements the Basel III capital accord 84 Table of Contents developed by the Basel Committee and certain Dodd-Frank Act capital provisions and updates the PCA capital requirements. The new capital framework establishes a new minimum Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio that will be phased-in starting in 2014 for bank holding companies subject to the Advanced risk-based capital rules adopted by the U.S. federal banking agencies ( Advanced Approaches ). The Final Rule also increases some of the thresholds for the PCA capital categories and adds, effective January 1, 2015, the new Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio to the PCA regulations. We disclose a non-GAAP TCE ratio in Summary of Selected Financial Data. While the TCE ratio is a capital measure widely used by investors, analysts and bank regulatory agencies to assess the capital position of financial services companies, it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We provide information on the calculation of this ratio in MD&A Supplemental Tables Table F: Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures and Calculation of Regulatory Capital Measures Under Basel I. Table 14 provides a comparison of our capital ratios under the Federal Reserve capital adequacy standards and the capital ratios of the Banks under the OCC capital adequacy standards as of December 31, 2013 and 2012.

Capital ratios that are not applicable are denoted by N/A. See MD&A Supplemental Tables Table F: Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures and Calculation of Regulatory Capital Measures Under Basel I for additional information. (2) Tier 1 common ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on Tier 1 common capital divided by risk-weighted assets. (3) Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets. (4) Total risk-based capital ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on total risk-based capital divided by risk-weighted assets. (5) Tier 1 leverage ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by quarterly average total assets, after certain adjustments. Our Tier 1 common ratio, as calculated under capital standards and regulations based on the international capital framework commonly known as Basel I, increased to 12.23% as of December 31, 2013, up from 10.96% as of December 31, 2012. The increase in our Tier 1 common ratio reflected strong internal capital generation from earnings. We realized the full benefit of the reduction in risk weighted assets from the Portfolio Sale, which was offset by the decline in capital level from the $1 billion repurchase of our common stock in the second half of 2013. We exceeded minimum capital requirements and would meet the well capitalized ratio levels specified under PCA for Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital under Federal Reserve capital standards for bank holding companies as of December 31, 2013 and 2012. The Banks also exceeded minimum regulatory 85 Table of Contents requirements under the OCC applicable capital adequacy guidelines and were well capitalized under PCA requirements as of December 31, 2013. Recent Developments in Capital Requirements As described above, the U.S. federal banking agencies recently adopted the Final Rule, which increases the minimum capital that we and other institutions are required to hold. Prior to being revised in the Final Rule, the minimum risk-based capital requirements adopted by the U.S. federal banking agencies followed Basel I as noted in Table 14 above and the Advanced Approaches for applicable banks and bank holding companies. Currently, we are subject to Basel I and are in the Advanced Approaches qualification process but are not formally subject to its capital requirements. The Final Rule modified both Basel I and the Advanced Approaches (as modified, referred to respectively as Basel III Standardized and the Basel III Advanced Approaches ). Under the Final Rule, beginning on January 1, 2014, as an Advanced Approaches banking organization that has yet to enter or exit parallel run, we must use Basel III Standardized for calculating our regulatory capital, including as used in our capital ratios, subject to transition periods. In 2014, however, we will continue to use Basel I for calculating our risk-weighted assets in our regulatory capital ratios. Beginning on January 1, 2015, we must use Basel III Standardized for calculating our risk-weighted assets in our regulatory capital ratios. Basel III Standardized Common Equity Tier 1 capital under the Final Rule includes additional adjustments and deductions not included in Basel I Tier 1 common capital, such as the inclusion of accumulated other comprehensive income from available for sale securities, and the deduction of assets related to defined benefit pension and other post-retirement employee benefit plans. The following table compares our Tier 1 common capital and risk weighted assets as of December 31, 2013, calculated under Basel I, to our estimated Common Equity Tier I capital and risk weighted assets as of December 31, 2013, calculated under Basel III Standardized, as it applies on January 1, 2014, January 1, 2015 and when fully phased-in. Our estimate of the Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio under Basel III Standardized is a non-GAAP financial measure. However, we believe this measure provides useful information to investors and others by measuring our progress against regulatory capital standards that will be applicable to the Company beginning in 2014. See the table and notes below for further discussion on our interpretations, expectations and assumptions used in calculating this ratio. 86 Table of Contents Table 15: Estimated Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio Under Basel III Standardized December 31, 2013 (Dollars in millions, except ratio) 2014 Phase-In 2015 Phase-In Full Phase-In Tier 1 common capital under Basel I rules $ 27,487 $ 27,487 $ 27,487 Adjustments related to AOCI for securities available for sale and defined benefit pension plans (1) (175 ) (350 ) (875 ) Adjustments related to PCCR intangible (1) (134 ) (402 ) (1,207 ) Other adjustments (1)(2) 305 230 5 Estimated Common Equity Tier 1 capital under Basel III Standardized $ 27,483 $ 26,965 $ 25,410 Risk-weighted assets under Basel I rules $ 224,671 $ 224,671 $ 224,671 Adjustments for Basel III Standardized (3) 210 7,979 7,805 Estimated risk-weighted assets adjusted for Basel III Standardized $ 224,881 $ 232,650 $ 232,476 Estimated Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio under Basel III Standardized (4) 12.2 % 11.6 % 10.9 % (1) Adjustments are phased in at 20% for 2014, at 40% for 2015, and at 100% for 2018 and beyond. (2) Other adjustments are related to disallowed deferred tax assets from net operating losses and tax credit carry forwards, mortgage servicing rights and other intangibles net of associated deferred tax liabilities. (3) Adjustments to Basel I risk weighted assets include higher risk weights for 90 days or more past due exposures, high volatility commercial real estate, securitization exposures and corresponding adjustments to PCCR intangibles, deferred tax assets and certain other assets in the calculation of Common Equity Tier 1 capital under Basel III Standardized. (4) Calculated by dividing Estimated Common Equity Tier 1 capital under Basel III Standardized by estimated risk-weighted assets adjusted for Basel III Standardized. With respect to the Basel III Advanced Approaches, we expect to enter the parallel run phase no earlier than January 1, 2015. We currently anticipate a multi-year parallel run consistent with the experience of other U.S. banks. By rule, this phase must last at least four consecutive quarters. Under the Final Rule, when we complete our parallel run for the Advanced Approaches, our minimum risk-based capital requirement will be the greater requirement of the Basel III Standardized and the Basel III Advanced Approaches. We anticipate that we will need to hold more regulatory capital under the Basel III Advanced Approaches than under Basel I or Basel III Standardized to meet our minimum required capital ratios. Capital Planning and Regulatory Stress Testing In November 2011, the Federal Reserve finalized capital planning rules applicable to large bank holding companies like us (commonly referred to as Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review or CCAR ). Under the rules, bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more must submit capital plans to the Federal Reserve on an annual basis and must obtain approval from the Federal Reserve before making most capital distributions. The purpose of the rules is to ensure that large bank holding companies have robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks and capital needs to continue operations through times of economic and financial stress. On September 24, 2013, the Federal Reserve released an interim final rule that stated, for the first time, that the 2014 CCAR cycle will require us to meet Basel III Standardized capital requirements, with appropriate phase-in provisions applicable to Advanced Approaches institutions during the CCAR planning horizon, under the supervisory severely adverse stress scenario in addition to the capital plan rule Tier 1 common ratio using Basel I definitions. See Recent Developments in Capital Requirements above for more information regarding Basel 87 Table of Contents III Standardized capital ratios. In November 2013, the Federal Reserve issued supervisory economic stress scenarios for the 2014 CCAR cycle. We submitted our 2014 capital plan to the Federal Reserve on January 6, 2014. Any proposed capital actions for the second quarter of 2014 through the first quarter of 2015 must be approved as part of the 2014 CCAR cycle. We consider various factors in the management of capital, including the impact of stress on our capital position, as determined by both our internal modeling and Federal Reserve modeling of our capital position in CCAR. In the 2013 stress test cycle, including CCAR, there was a large difference between our estimates of our capital levels under stress and the Federal Reserve estimates of our capital levels under stress. In the 2014 stress test cycle, including CCAR, the difference could be larger because, in addition to using its own assumptions in modeling credit losses and pre-provision net revenue, the Federal Reserve will use its own assumptions in modeling balance sheet size and composition. This modeling creates additional differences between our internal models and those of the Federal Reserve in the estimation of both credit losses and pre-provision net revenue. Therefore, although our estimated capital levels under stress suggest that we have substantial capacity to return capital to shareholders and remain well capitalized under stress, it is possible that the Federal Reserve modeling may result in a materially lower capacity to return capital to shareholders than our estimates. Dividend Policy and Stock Purchases We paid common stock dividends of $0.05 per share in the first quarter, and $0.30 per share in the second, third and fourth quarter in 2013. We paid preferred stock dividends of $15.00 per share on the outstanding shares of our 6.00% fixed rate non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series B (the Series B Preferred Stock ) in each of the four quarters in 2013. On January 29, 2014, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share, payable February 21, 2014 to stockholders of record as of February 10, 2014, and a quarterly dividend of $15.00 per share of Series B Preferred Stock. Each outstanding share of the Series B Preferred Stock is represented by depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of Series B Preferred Stock. The dividend of $15.00 per share (equivalent to $0.375 per outstanding depository share) will be paid on March 3, 2014 to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 14, 2014. The declaration and payment of dividends to our stockholders, as well as the amount thereof, are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, capital levels, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors. As a bank holding company, our ability to pay dividends is largely dependent upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries. Regulatory restrictions exist that limit the ability of the Banks to transfer funds to our bank holding company. Funds available for dividend payments from COBNA and CONA were $2.3 billion and $127 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2013. There can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends. For additional information on dividends, see Part I Item 1. Business Supervision and Regulation Dividends, Stock Purchases and Transfer of Funds . In the third quarter, we began executing the 2013 Stock Repurchase Program and we completed the 2013 Stock Repurchase Program in the fourth quarter. 88 Table of Contents RISK MANAGEMENT Risk Framework We use a risk framework to manage risk. We execute against our risk management framework with the Three Lines of Defense risk management model to demonstrate and structure the roles, responsibilities and accountabilities in the organization for taking and managing risk. The First Line of Defense is comprised of the business areas that through their day-to-day business activities take risk on our behalf. As the business owner, the first line is responsible for identifying, assessing, managing and controlling that risk, and for mitigating our overall risk exposure. The Second Line of Defense provides oversight of first line risk taking and management, and is comprised of our Risk Management organization and other staff control functions. The second line assists in determining risk capacity, risk appetite, and the strategies, policies and structure for managing risks. The second line is both an expert advisor to the first line and an effective challenger of first line risk activities. The Third Line of Defense is comprised of our Internal Audit and Credit Review functions. The third line provides independent and objective assurance to senior management and to the Board of Directors that first and second line risk management and internal control systems and its governance processes are well-designed and working as intended. Our risk framework, which is built around governance, processes and people, consists of the following eight key elements: Establish governance processes, accountabilities, and risk appetites The starting point of our risk framework is the establishment of governance processes, accountabilities and appetites. Our Board of Directors and senior management establish the tone at the top regarding the importance of internal control, including standards of conduct and the integrity and ethical values of the company. Management reinforces the expectations at the various levels of the organization. This portion of the framework sets the foundation for the methods that govern risk taking, the interactions within and among the lines of defense and the risk appetites and tolerances. Identify and assess risks and ownership Identifying and assessing risks and ownership is the beginning of the more detailed day-to-day process of managing risk. This portion of the framework clarifies the importance of strong first-line management and accountability for identifying and assessing risk while specifying the roles of the second line to identify and assess risk, particularly when taking on new initiatives. Develop and operate controls, monitoring and mitigation plans We develop, operate and monitor controls to manage risk within tolerance levels. The first line develops controls to oversee and manage identified risks. Controls may prevent risks from occurring (e.g., ensuring compliance with a law or regulation), discover when a risk has been realized, or measure the amount of risk being taken so that the amount may be proactively managed. Whenever possible, plans are implemented to mitigate risks or reduce them to lower levels to reduce exposure. The first line leads mitigation, control and monitoring actions. The second line is a consultant on control design when needed. Test and detect control gaps and perform corrective action While the first line is principally accountable for taking, controlling and monitoring risk, the second line oversees and monitors first line risk taking, including the effectiveness of first line controls, and the third line independently tests first and second line controls. These activities provide the second and third lines of defense with the ability to reduce the likelihood of unauthorized or unplanned risk taking within the organization. Identified control gaps are closed by first line corrective action. 89 Table of Contents Escalate key risks and gaps to executive management, and when appropriate the Board of Directors Escalation is an important component of our overall Risk Framework. Use of escalation is encouraged and doesn t necessarily indicate a failure on the part of first, second or third line risk management. Through escalation in the first line, decisions requiring judgment can be raised to executives who have the broadest possible context and experience to make challenging choices. Escalation in the second and third lines of defense can also demonstrate part of their core responsibilities of effective challenge. Risks are escalated to the Board of Directors to ensure alignment with high risk decisions and/or transparency to the largest risks facing the organization and to enable Board of Directors engagement when needed. Calculate and allocate capital in alignment with risk management and measurement processes (including stress testing) Capital is held to protect the company from unforeseen risks or unexpected risk severity. As such, it is important that capital planning processes be well linked with risk management practices to ensure the appropriate capital protections are in place for the safety and soundness of the company. Stress testing and economic capital measurement, both of which incorporate inputs from across the risk spectrum, are key tools for evaluating our capital position and risk adjusted returns. Support with the right culture, talent and skills The right culture, talent and skills are critical to effective risk management. The activities and actions specified in our Risk Framework are supported with the right culture to ensure that both the spirit and the letter of the risk management action are pursued. Skills necessary to effectively manage risk are reinforced through performance management systems. When needed, risk talent is augmented through recruitment of industry experts as well as training and development of internal associates. Enabled by the right data, infrastructure and systems Data, infrastructure and programs are key enablers of our overall risk management processes and practices. These core requirements enable effective risk modeling, efficient first, second and third line risk activity performance and cross-line interaction. In addition, effective program design of each risk category is regularly assessed to ensure risk practices continue to evolve with leading industry practice and continue to interact across categories as desired for a strong overall risk management program. Risk Appetite Risk appetite refers to the level of risk our business is willing to take in pursuit of our corporate business objectives.The Board of Directors approves our risk appetite including specific risk limits where applicable. While first line executives manage risk on a day-to-day basis, the Chief Risk Officer provides effective challenge and independent oversight to ensure that risks are within the appetite and specific limits established by the Board of Directors. The Chief Risk Officer reports to the Board of Directors regularly on the nature and level of risk across all eight risk categories. In addition to his broader management responsibilities, our Chief Executive Officer is responsible for developing the strategy and mission of our organization, determining and leading our culture, and reviewing and providing input into our risk appetite. We have a defined Enterprise Risk Appetite Statement, which governs and embraces the overall tenets of our risk management culture. The Enterprise Risk Appetite Statement sets the tone for how our Board of Directors and our company approach risk, supports our mission, values, and strategic imperatives We have a defined risk appetite for each of our eight risk categories that is approved by our Board of Directors. Stated risk appetites define the parameters for taking and accepting risks and are used by management and our 90 Table of Contents Board of Directors to make business decisions. We communicate risk appetite statements, limits and thresholds to the appropriate levels in the organization and monitor adherence. Risk Categories We apply our Risk Framework to protect our company from the eight major categories of risk that we are exposed to through our business activities. Our eight major categories of risk are: Compliance Risk: Compliance risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from violations of laws, rules, or regulations. Compliance risk can also arise from nonconformance with prescribed practices, internal policies and procedures, contractual obligations, or ethical standards that reinforce those laws, rules, or regulations; Credit Risk: Credit risk is the risk of loss from an obligor failure to meet the terms of any contract or otherwise fail to perform as agreed; Legal Risk: Legal risk represents the risk of material adverse impact due to: new and changed laws and regulations; interpretations of law; drafting, interpretation and enforceability of contracts; adverse decisions or consequences arising from litigation or regulatory scrutiny; the establishment, management and governance of our legal entity structure; and the failure to seek or follow appropriate Legal counsel when needed; Liquidity Risk: Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its future financial obligations as they come due, or invest in future asset growth because of an inability to obtain funds at a reasonable price within a reasonable time period; Market Risk: Market risk is the risk that an institution earnings or the economic value of equity could be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or other market factors; Operational Risk: Operational risk is the risk of loss, capital impairment, adverse customer experience, or reputational impact resulting from failure to comply with policies and procedures, inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, or from external events; Reputation Risk: Reputation Risk is the risk to market value, recruitment and retention of talented associates and maintenance of a loyal customer base due to the negative perceptions of Capital One internal and external constituents regarding Capital One business strategies and activities; and Strategic Risk: Strategic risk is the risk that Capital One fails to achieve short and long-term business objectives because we fail to develop the products, capabilities, and competitive position necessary to attract consumers, beat competitors and withstand market volatility. The result is a failure to deliver long term returns expected by stakeholders. Below we provide an overview of how we manage our eight primary risk categories. Compliance Risk Management We recognize that compliance requirements for financial institutions are increasingly complex and that there are heightened expectations from our regulators and our customers. In response, we continuously evaluate the regulatory environment and pro-actively adjust our compliance risk program to fully address these expectations. Our Compliance Management Program establishes expectations for determining compliance requirements, assessing the risk of new product offerings, creating appropriate controls and training to address requirements, monitoring for control performance, and independently testing for adherence to compliance requirements. Business areas incorporate compliance requirements and controls into their business policies, standards, processes and procedures. They regularly monitor and report on the efficacy of their compliance controls and Corporate Compliance periodically independently tests to validate the effectiveness of business controls. 91 Table of Contents Credit Risk Management We recognize that we are exposed to cyclical changes in credit quality. Consequently, we try to ensure our credit portfolio is resilient to economic downturns. Our most important tool in this endeavor is sound underwriting, using what we deem to be conservative assumptions. In unsecured consumer loan underwriting, we generally assume that loans will be subject to an environment in which losses are higher than those prevailing at the time of underwriting. In commercial underwriting, we generally require strong cash flow, collateral and covenants and guarantees. In addition to sound underwriting, we continually monitor our portfolio and take steps to collect or work out distressed loans. Our credit policies establish standards in five areas: customer selection, underwriting, monitoring, remediation, and portfolio management. The standards in each area provide a framework comprising specific objectives and control processes. These standards are supported by detailed policies and procedures for each component of the credit process. Starting with customer selection, our goal is to generally provide credit on terms that generate above hurdle returns. We use a number of quantitative and qualitative factors to manage credit risk, including setting credit risk limits and guidelines for each of our lines of business. We monitor performance and forecasts relative to these guidelines and report results and any required mitigating actions to appropriate senior management committees and our Board of Directors. Legal Risk Management The General Counsel provides legal evaluation and guidance to the enterprise and business areas and partners with other risk management functions such as Compliance and Internal Audit. This evaluation and guidance is based on an assessment of the type and degree of legal risk associated with the internal business area practices and activities and of the controls the business has in place to mitigate legal risks. Liquidity Risk Management We seek to mitigate liquidity risk strategically and tactically. From a strategic perspective, we have acquired and built deposit gathering businesses and significantly reduced our loan to deposit ratio. From a tactical perspective, we have accumulated a sizeable liquidity reserve comprising cash, high-quality, unencumbered securities, and committed collateralized credit lines. This combination of funding and liquidity sources facilitates a diverse access to multiple markets and liquidity sources. We assess liquidity strength by evaluating several different balance sheet metrics under severe stress scenarios to ensure we can withstand significant funding degradation in both idiosyncratic and market wide liquidity stress scenarios. Management reports liquidity metrics to appropriate senior management committees and our Board of Directors no less than quarterly. We continuously monitor market and economic conditions to evaluate emerging stress conditions with assessment and appropriate action plans in accordance with our Liquidity Contingency Plan. Market Risk Management We recognize that interest rate and foreign exchange risk is inherent in the business of banking due to the nature of the assets and liabilities of banks. Banks typically manage the trade-off between near-term earnings volatility and market value volatility by targeting moderate levels of each. In addition to using industry accepted techniques to analyze and measure interest rate and foreign exchange risk, we perform sensitivity analysis to identify our risk exposures under a broad range of scenarios. Investment securities and derivatives are the main levers for the management of interest rate and foreign exchange risk. We manage market risk exposure, which is principally driven by balance sheet interest rate risk, centrally and establish quantitative limits to control our exposure. Market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our business operations and activities, including loans, deposits, securities, short-term borrowings, long-term debt and derivatives. 92 Table of Contents The market risk positions of our banking entities and our total company are calculated separately and in total and are reported in comparison to pre-established limits to the Asset Liability Committee monthly and to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors no less than quarterly. Management is authorized to utilize financial instruments as outlined in our policy to actively manage market risk exposure. Operational Risk Management We recognize the criticality of managing operational risk on a day-to-day basis and have expanded our approach to operational risk management based on the growth and complexity of the company. We have appropriate operational risk management policy, standards, processes and tools to enable the delivery of high quality and consistent customer and client experiences. The Operational Risk Management Program establishes requirements and control processes that assure certain consistent practices in the management of operational risk and provides transparency to the corporate operational risk profile. Operational risk practices are currently being aligned with Basel II AMA ( Advanced Measurement Approach ) requirements. Reputation Risk Management We recognize that reputation risk is of particular concern for financial institutions as a result of the aftermath of the financial crisis and economic downturn, which has resulted in increased scrutiny and widespread regulatory changes. We manage both strategic and tactical reputation issues and build our relationships with the government, media, consumer advocates, and other constituencies to help strengthen the reputations of both our company and industry. Our actions include implementing pro-consumer practices in our business and taking public positions in support of better consumer practices in our industry. Day to day activities are controlled by the frameworks set forth in the Reputation Risk Management Policy and other risk management policies. Strategic Risk Management We recognize that maintaining a strong capital position is essential to our business strategy and competitive position. We also recognize that regulatory and market expectations for the amount and quality of capital are rising. Understanding and managing risks to our capital position is an underlying objective of all our risk programs. The Chief Executive Officer develops an overall corporate strategy and leads alignment of our entire organization with this strategy through the definition of strategic imperatives and top-down communication. The Chief Executive Officer and other senior executives spend significant time throughout our entire company sharing our corporate strategy and related business strategies and connecting them to day-to-day associate activities to enable effective execution. CREDIT RISK PROFILE Our loan portfolio accounts for the substantial majority of our credit risk exposure. These activities are also governed under our credit policy and are subject to independent review and approval. Below we provide information about the composition of our loan portfolio, key concentrations and credit performance metrics. We also engage in certain non-lending activities that may give rise to credit and counterparty settlement risk, including the purchase of securities for our investment securities portfolio, entering into derivative transactions to manage our market risk exposure and to accommodate customers, foreign exchange transactions, and customer overdrafts. We provide additional information on credit risk related to our investment securities portfolio under Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis Investment Securities and credit risk related to derivative transactions in Note 10 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. 93 Table of Contents Primary Loan Products We provide a variety of lending products. Our primary products include credit cards, auto loans, home loans and commercial loans. Credit cards : We originate both prime and subprime credit cards through a variety of channels. Our credit cards generally have variable interest rates. Credit card accounts are underwritten using an automated underwriting system based on predictive models that we have developed. The underwriting criteria, which are customized for individual products and marketing programs, are established based on an analysis of the net present value of expected revenues, expenses and losses, subject to a further analysis using a variety of stress conditions. Underwriting decisions are generally based on credit bureau information, including payment history, debt burden and credit scores, such as FICO, and on other factors, such as applicant income. We maintain a credit card securitization program and selectively sell charged-off credit card loans. Prior to February 1, 2013, we had not securitized any credit card loans since 2009. Auto loans : We originate both prime and subprime auto loans. Customers are acquired through a network of auto dealers and direct marketing. Our auto loans generally have fixed interest rates and loan terms of 72 months or less. Loan size limits are customized by program and are generally less than $75,000. Similar to credit card accounts, the underwriting criteria are customized for individual products and marketing programs and based on analysis of net present value of expected revenues, expenses and losses, subject to maintaining resilience under a variety of stress conditions. Underwriting decisions are generally based on an applicant income, estimated debt-to-income ratio, and credit bureau information, along with collateral characteristics such as loan-to-value ( LTV ) ratio. We generally retain all of our auto loans, though we have securitized auto loans and sold charged-off auto loans in the past and may do so in the future. Home loans: Most of the existing home loans in our loan portfolio were originated by banks we acquired. The underwriting standards for these loans were less restrictive than our current underwriting standards. Currently, we originate residential mortgage and home equity loans through our branches, direct marketing, and dedicated home loan officers. Our home loan products include conforming and non-conforming fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgage loans, as well as first and second lien home equity loans and lines of credit. In general, our underwriting policy limits for these loans include: (1) a maximum LTV ratio of 80% for loans without mortgage insurance; (2) a maximum LTV ratio of 95% for loans with mortgage insurance or for home equity products; (3) a maximum debt-to-income ratio of 50%; and (4) a maximum loan amount of $3.0 million. Our underwriting procedures are intended to verify the income of applicants and obtain appraisals to determine home values. We may, in limited instances, use automated valuation models to determine home values. Our underwriting standards for conforming loans are designed to meet the underwriting standards required by the agencies at a minimum, and we sell most of our conforming loans to the agencies. We generally retain non-conforming mortgages and home equity loans and lines of credit. Commercial loans. We offer a range of commercial lending products, including loans secured by commercial real estate and loans to middle market industrial and service companies. Our commercial loans may have a fixed or variable interest rate; however, the majority of our commercial loans have variable rates. Our underwriting standards require an analysis of the borrower financial condition and prospects, as well as an assessment of the industry in which the borrower operates. Where relevant, we evaluate and appraise underlying collateral and guarantees. We maintain underwriting guidelines and limits for major types of borrowers and loan products that specify, where applicable, guidelines for debt service coverage, leverage, LTV ratio and standard covenants and conditions. We assign a risk rating and establish a monitoring schedule for loans based on the risk profile of the borrower, industry segment, source of repayment, the underlying collateral and guarantees (if any) and current market conditions. Although we generally retain commercial loans, we may syndicate large positions for risk mitigation purposes. In addition, we have sold impaired commercial loans in the past and may do so in the future. 94 Table of Contents Loan Portfolio Composition Our total loan portfolio consists of loans held for investment, loans held for sale and loans underlying our securitization trust. Loans underlying our securitization trusts are reported on our consolidated balance sheets in restricted loans for securitization investors. Table 16 presents the composition of our portfolio of loans held for investment, by business segments, as of December 31, 2013 and 2012. Table 16 also displays Acquired Loans. See the discussion of Loans Acquired below in this section for further information. Table 16 and the credit metrics presented in this section exclude loans held for sale, which are carried at lower of cost or fair value and totaled $218 million and $201 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

(2) Includes construction loans and land development loans totaling $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2013 and $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2012. Credit Card accounted for $81.3 billion, or 41%, of our total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2013, compared with $91.8 billion, or 45% as of December 31, 2012. We market our credit card products on a national basis throughout the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. Because of the diversity of our credit card products and national marketing approach, no single geographic concentration exists within the credit card portfolio. 95 Table of Contents Consumer Banking accounted for $70.8 billion, or 36%, of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2013, compared with $75.1 billion, or 37%, of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2012. The auto portfolio is originated primarily on a national basis, with additional originations through our retail branch network. The home loan portfolio is concentrated in California, New York, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, Virginia, and Florida which reflects the characteristics of the ING Direct portfolio that comprises the majority of our home loans. Retail banking includes small business loans and other consumer lending products originated through our branch network. Commercial Banking represented $45.0 billion, or 23%, of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2013, compared with $38.8 billion, or 19%, as of December 31, 2012. We operate our Commercial Banking business primarily in geographic regions where we maintain retail bank branches. Accordingly, the portfolio is concentrated in New York, Louisiana and Texas, which represent our largest retail banking markets. Our small-ticket commercial real estate portfolio, which was originated on a national basis through a broker network, is in a run-off mode. We provide additional information on the geographic concentration, by loan category, of our loan portfolio in Note 4 Loans. Loans Acquired in Business Acquisitions As noted above, our portfolio of loans held for investment includes loans acquired in the CCB, ING Direct and 2012 U.S. card acquisitions. These loans were recorded at fair value as of the date of each acquisition. We elect to account for purchased loans using the guidance for accounting for purchased credit-impaired loans, which is based on expected cash flows, unless specifically scoped out of the guidance. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Loans for additional information on our accounting for loans, including purchased loans. See Note 4 Loans and Note 5 Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses for additional information on the credit quality of our loan portfolio. Loan Maturity Profile Table 17 presents the maturities of loans in our held-for-investment portfolio as of December 31, 2013. Table 17: Loan Maturity Schedule December 31, 2013 (Dollars in millions) Due Up to 1 Year > 1 Year to 5 Years > 5 Years Total Fixed rate: Credit card (1)(2) $ 2,841 $ 14,025 $ 9 $ 16,875 Consumer 682 23,968 14,413 39,063 Commercial 1,034 5,456 6,633 13,123 Other 25 25 Total fixed-rate loans 4,557 43,449 21,080 69,086 Variable rate: Credit card (1) 64,400 30 64,430 Consumer (3) 14,260 13,539 3,900 31,699 Commercial 28,885 2,856 147 31,888 Other 80 7 9 96 Total variable-rate loans 107,625 16,432 4,056 128,113 Total loans $ 112,182 $ 59,881 $ 25,136 $ 197,199 96 Table of Contents (1) Due to the revolving nature of credit card loans, we report majority of our variable-rate credit card loans as due in one year or less. We report fixed-rate credit card loans with introductory rates that expire after a certain period of time as due in one year or less. We assume that the rest of our remaining fixed-rate credit card loans will mature within one to three years. (2) Includes installment loans of $323 million as of December 31, 2013. (3) We report the maturity period for the home loans portfolio included in the Consumer Banking business based on the earlier of the next re-pricing or contractual maturity date of the loan. Credit Risk Measurement We closely monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to assess and manage our exposure to credit risk. Key metrics we track in evaluating the credit quality of our loan portfolio include delinquency and nonperforming asset rates, as well as charge-off rates and our internal risk ratings of larger balance commercial loans. Trends in delinquency rates are a primary indicator of credit risk within our consumer loan portfolios, as changes in delinquency rate provide an early warning of changes in credit losses. The primary indicator of credit risk in our commercial loan portfolios is risk ratings. Because we generally classify loans that have been delinquent for an extended period of time and other loans with significant risk of loss as nonperforming, the level of nonperforming assets represents another indicator of the potential for future credit losses. In addition to delinquency rates, the geographic distribution of our loans provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio based on regional economic conditions. We use borrower credit scores in underwriting for most consumer loans. We do not use credit scores as a primary indicator of credit quality because product differences, loan structure, and other factors drive large differences in credit quality for a given credit score. We continuously adjust our management of credit lines and collection strategies based on customer behavior and risk profile changes. As noted above, our Credit Card business accounted for $81.3 billion, or 41%, of our total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2013, with Domestic Card accounting for $73.3 billion, or 37%, of our total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2013. In comparison, our Credit Card business accounted for $91.8 billion, or 45%, of our total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2012, with Domestic Card accounting for $83.1 billion, or 40%, of our total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2012. Based on our most recent data, we estimate that approximately one-third of our Domestic Card portfolio had credit scores equal or below 660 or no score, based on loan balances, as of December 31, 2013, relatively consistent with the proportion of the Domestic Card portfolio with credit scores equal or below 660 or no score as of December 31, 2012. We present information in the table below on the credit performance of our loan portfolio, including the key metrics we use in tracking changes in the credit quality of our loan portfolio. We also present adjusted credit quality metrics excluding impact from Acquired Loans that are accounted for based on estimated cash flows. Delinquency Rates We consider the entire balance of an account to be delinquent if the minimum required payment is not received by the first statement cycle date equal to or following the due date specified on the customer billing statement. Table 18 compares 30+ day performing and total 30+ day delinquency rates, by loan category, as of December 31, 2013 and 2012. Table 18 also presents these metrics adjusted to exclude from the denominator Acquired Loans accounted for based on estimated cash flows expected to be collected over the life of the loans. Our 30+ day delinquency metrics include all held for investment loans that are 30 or more days past due, whereas our 30+ day performing delinquency metrics include loans that are 30 or more days past due and that are also currently classified as performing and accruing interest. The 30+ day delinquency and 30+ day performing delinquency metrics are generally the same for credit card loans, as we continue to classify the substantial majority of credit card loans as performing until the account is charged-off, typically when the account is 180 days past due. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Loans for information on our policies for classifying loans as nonperforming for each of our loan categories. 97 Table of Contents Table 18: 30+ Day Delinquencies December 31, 2013 December 31, 2012 30+ Day Performing 30+ Day Total 30+ Day Performing 30+ Day Total (Dollars in millions) Amount Rate (1) Adjusted Rate (2) Amount Rate (1) Adjusted Rate (2) Amount Rate (1) Adjusted Rate (2) Amount Rate (1) Adjusted Rate (2) Credit Card: Domestic credit card and installment loans . $ 2,514 3.43 % 3.43 % $ 2,514 3.43 % 3.43 % $ 3,001 3.61 % 3.62 % $ 3,001 3.61 % 3.62 % International credit card 299 3.71 3.71 367 4.56 4.56 308 3.58 3.58 387 4.49 4.49 Total credit card 2,813 3.46 3.46 2,881 3.54 3.55 3,309 3.61 3.62 3,388 3.69 3.70 Consumer Banking: Auto 2,181 6.85 6.85 2,375 7.46 7.46 1,900 7.00 7.01 2,049 7.55 7.56 Home loan 55 0.16 0.78 323 0.91 4.55 59 0.13 0.77 380 0.86 4.94 Retail banking 25 0.69 0.70 52 1.44 1.46 30 0.76 0.77 81 2.07 2.09 Total consumer banking 2,261 3.20 5.32 2,750 3.89 6.47 1,989 2.65 5.14 2,510 3.34 6.49 Commercial Banking: Commercial and multifamily real estate 29 0.14 0.14 64 0.31 0.31 140 0.79 0.79 248 1.40 1.41 Commercial and industrial 73 0.31 0.32 108 0.46 0.47 73 0.37 0.37 135 0.68 0.69 Total commercial lending 102 0.23 0.23 172 0.39 0.39 213 0.57 0.57 383 1.02 1.03 Small-ticket commercial real estate 8 0.79 0.79 11 1.17 1.17 33 2.74 2.74 43 3.60 3.60 Total commercial banking 110 0.24 0.25 183 0.41 0.41 246 0.63 0.64 426 1.10 1.11 Other: Other loans 4 3.32 3.32 19 15.72 15.72 11 5.72 6.95 36 19.25 23.38 Total $ 5,188 2.63 % 3.08 % $ 5,833 2.96 % 3.46 % $ 5,555 2.70 % 3.29 % $ 6,360 3.09 % 3.77 % (1) Calculated by loan category by dividing 30+ day delinquent loans as of the end of the period by period-end loans held for investment for the specified loan category, including Acquired Loans as applicable.

These loans consist primarily of credit card accounts between 90 days and 179 days past due. As permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council ( FFIEC ), we generally continue to accrue interest and fees on domestic credit card loans through the date of charge-off, which is typically in the period the account becomes 180 days past due. While domestic credit card loans typically remain on accrual status until the loan is charged-off, we reduce the balance of our credit card receivables by the amount of finance charges and fees billed but not expected to be collected and exclude this amount from revenue.

(2) Calculated by dividing loans in each geographic region by total period-end loans held for investment. Nonperforming Assets Nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans and foreclosed property and repossessed assets. Nonperforming loans generally include loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status and certain restructured loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. In addition, we separately track and report Acquired Loans accounted for based on expected cash flows and disclose our delinquency and nonperforming loan rates with and without these Acquired Loans. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Loans for information on our policies for classifying loans as nonperforming for each of our loan categories. Table 21 presents comparative information on nonperforming loans, by loan category, as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the ratio of nonperforming loans to our total loans. We do not classify loans held for sale as nonperforming, as they are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. 99 Table of Contents Table 21: Nonperforming Loans and Other Nonperforming Assets (1)(2)(3) (Dollars in millions) December 31, 2013 December 31, 2012 Amount % of Total HFI Loans Amount % of Total HFI Loans Nonperforming loans held for investment: Credit card: International credit card $ 88 1.10 % $ 100 1.16 % Total credit card 88 0.11 100 0.11 Consumer Banking: Auto 194 0.61 149 0.55 Home loan 376 1.06 422 0.96 Retail banking 41 1.13 71 1.82 Total consumer banking 611 0.86 642 0.85 Commercial Banking: Commercial and multifamily real estate 52 0.25 137 0.77 Commercial and industrial 93 0.40 133 0.67 Total commercial lending 145 0.33 270 0.72 Small-ticket commercial real estate 4 0.41 12 0.97 Total commercial banking 149 0.33 282 0.73 Other: Other loans 19 15.83 30 15.85 Total nonperforming loans held for investment (4) $ 867 0.44 % $ 1,054 0.51 % Other nonperforming assets: Foreclosed property (5) $ 113 0.06 % $ 204 0.10 % Other assets (6) 160 0.08 109 0.05 Total other nonperforming assets 273 0.14 313 0.15 Total nonperforming assets $ 1,140 0.58 % $ 1,367 0.66 % (1) The ratio of nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans held for investment is calculated based on the nonperforming loans divided by the total outstanding unpaid principal balance of loans held for investment. The denominator used in calculating the nonperforming asset ratios consists of total loans held for investment and other nonperforming assets. (2) The nonperforming loan ratio, excluding Acquired Loans accounted for based on expected cash flows from the denominator, for home loan, total consumer banking, and total nonperforming loans held for investment was 5.29%, 1.44%, and 0.51%, respectively, as of December 31, 2013, compared with 5.48%, 1.66%, and 0.62%, respectively, as of December 31, 2012. The nonperforming asset ratio, excluding the impact of Acquired Loans accounted for based on expected cash flows was 0.63% and 0.71% as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. (3) We recognized interest income for loans classified as nonperforming of $40 million and $32 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Interest income foregone related to nonperforming loans was $55 million and $41 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Foregone interest income represents the amount of interest income that would have been recorded during the period for nonperforming loans as of the end of the period had the loans performed according to their contractual terms. (4) Nonperforming loans as a percentage of loans held for investment, excluding domestic credit card loans from the denominator, was 0.70% and 0.86% as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. (5) Includes foreclosed properties related to Acquired Loans of $68 million and $167 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. (6) Beginning in the third quarter of 2013, we began including the net realizable value of auto loans that have been charged-off as a result of a bankruptcy in addition to repossessed assets obtained in satisfaction of auto loans. Both of these amounts are included in other assets. Prior period amounts have been adjusted to conform to current period presentation. 100 Table of Contents Net Charge-Offs Net charge-offs consist of the unpaid principal balance of loans held for investment that we determine are uncollectible, net of recovered amounts. We exclude accrued and unpaid finance charges and fees and fraud losses from charge-offs. Charge-offs are recorded as a reduction to the allowance for loan and lease losses and subsequent recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan and lease losses. Costs incurred to recover charged-off loans are recorded as collection expense and included in our consolidated statements of income as a component of other non-interest expense. Our charge-off time frame for loans varies based on the loan type. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Loans for information on our charge-off policy for each of our loan categories. Table 22 presents our net charge-off amounts and rates, by business segment, in 2013, 2012 and 2011.

Table 23 presents the loan balances as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, for which loan modifications were made as part of our loss mitigation efforts, all of which are considered to be troubled debt restructurings ( TDR ). Table 23 excludes loan modifications that do not meet the definition of a TDR and Acquired Loans accounted for based on expected cash flows, which we track and report separately. Table 23: Loan Modifications and Restructurings (Dollars in millions) December 31, 2013 December 31, 2012 Amount % of Total Modifications Amount % of Total Modifications Modified and restructured loans: Credit card (1) $ 780 46.4 % $ 873 48.7 % Auto 355 21.1 328 18.3 Home loan 244 14.5 145 8.1 Retail banking 64 3.8 65 3.6 Commercial banking 238 14.2 383 21.3 Total $ 1,681 100.0 % $ 1,794 100.0 % Status of modified and restructured loans: Performing $ 1,250 74.4 % $ 1,419 79.1 % Nonperforming 431 25.6 375 20.9 Total $ 1,681 100.0 % $ 1,794 100.0 % (1) Amount reported reflects the total outstanding customer balance, which consists of unpaid principal balance, accrued interest and fees. The outstanding balance of loan modifications made to assist borrowers experiencing financial difficulties decreased to $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2013, from $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2012. Of these modifications, approximately $431 million, or 26%, were classified as nonperforming as of December 31, 2013, compared with $375 million, or 21%, as of December 31, 2012. Credit card loan modifications account for the majority of our TDR loan modifications, representing $780 million, or 46%, of the outstanding balance of total TDR loans as of December 31, 2013, and $873 million, or 49%, of the outstanding balance of total TDR loans as of December 31, 2012. The vast majority of our credit card TDR loan modifications involve a reduction in the interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months. We determine the effective interest rate for purposes of measuring impairment on modified loans that involve a reduction and are considered to be a TDR based on the interest rate in effect immediately prior to the loan entering the modification program. In some cases, the interest rate on a credit card account is automatically increased due to non-payment, late payment or similar events. In all cases, we cancel the customer available line of credit on the credit card. If the customer does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan agreement may revert to its original payment terms, with the amount of any loan outstanding reflected in the appropriate delinquency category. The loan amount may then be charged-off in accordance with our standard charge-off policy. 102 Table of Contents Home loan modifications represented $244 million, or 15%, of the outstanding balance of total modified loans as of December 31, 2013, compared with $145 million, or 8%, of the outstanding balance of total modified loans as of December 31, 2012. The majority of our modified home loans involve a combination of an interest rate reduction, term extension or principal forbearance. Retail banking loan modifications represented $64 million, or 4%, of the outstanding balance of total modified loans as of December 31, 2013 compared with $65 million, or 4%, of the outstanding balance of total loans as of December 31, 2012. Commercial loan modifications represented $238 million, or 14%, of the outstanding balance of total modified loans as of December 31, 2013, compared with $383 million, or 21%, of the outstanding balance of total modified loans as of December 31, 2012. The vast majority of modified commercial loans include a reduction in interest rate or a term extension. We provide additional information on modified loans accounted for as TDRs, including the performance of those loans subsequent to modification, in Note 4 Loans. Impaired Loans A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due from the borrower in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan. Generally, we report loans as impaired based on the method for measuring impairment in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. Loans defined as individually impaired, include larger balance commercial nonperforming loans and TDR loans. Loans held for sale are not reported as impaired, as these loans are recorded at lower of cost or fair value. Impaired loans also exclude Acquired Loans accounted for based on estimated cash flows because this accounting methodology takes into consideration future credit losses expected to be incurred, as discussed above under Summary of Selected Financial Data. Impaired loans, including TDRs, totaled $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2013, compared with $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2012. TDRs accounted for $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion of impaired loans as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We provide additional information on our impaired loans, including the allowance established for these loans, in Note 4 Loans and Note 5 Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses. Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Our allowance for loan and lease losses represents management best estimate of incurred loan and lease credit losses inherent in our held for investment portfolio as of each balance sheet date. We provide additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used in determining our allowance for loan and lease losses in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Table 24 displays changes in our allowance for loan and lease losses for 2013, 2012 and 2011, which details by loan type, the provision for credit losses recognized in our consolidated statements of income each period and charge-offs recorded against the allowance for loan and lease losses. 103 Table of Contents Table 24: Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Activity Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2013 2012 2011 Balance at beginning of period, as reported $ 5,156 $ 4,250 $ 5,628 Provision for credit losses (1) 3,401 4,446 2,401 Charge-offs: Credit Card: Domestic credit card and installment loans (3,969 ) (3,507 ) (3,558 ) International credit card (573 ) (652 ) (752 ) Total credit card (4,542 ) (4,159 ) (4,310 ) Consumer Banking: Auto (784 ) (631 ) (529 ) Home loan (26 ) (77 ) (104 ) Retail banking (78 ) (89 ) (99 ) Total consumer banking (888 ) (797 ) (732 ) Commercial Banking: Commercial and multifamily real estate (6 ) (23 ) (76 ) Commercial and industrial (26 ) (32 ) (61 ) Total commercial lending (32 ) (55 ) (137 ) Small-ticket commercial real estate (17 ) (39 ) (77 ) Total commercial banking (49 ) (94 ) (214 ) Other loans (26 ) (43 ) (59 ) Total charge-offs (5,505 ) (5,093 ) (5,315 ) Recoveries: Credit Card: Domestic credit card and installment loans 1,065 975 1,036 International credit card 192 240 218 Total credit card 1,257 1,215 1,254 Consumer Banking: Auto 238 217 195 Home loan 10 25 27 Retail banking 24 24 26 Total consumer banking 272 266 248 Commercial Banking: Commercial and multifamily real estate 14 18 12 Commercial and industrial 11 25 20 Total commercial lending 25 43 32 Small-ticket commercial real estate 10 9 5 Total commercial banking 35 52 37 Other loans 7 5 5 Total recoveries 1,571 1,538 1,544 Net charge-offs (3,934 ) (3,555 ) (3,771 ) Impact of loan transfers, sales and other changes (2) (308 ) 15 (8 ) Balance at end of period $ 4,315 $ 5,156 $ 4,250 Allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loans held for investment 2.19 % 2.50 % 3.13 % 104 Table of Contents (1) The total provision for credit losses reported in our consolidated statements of income of $3.5 billion, $4.4 billion and $2.4 billion in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, consists of a provision for loan and lease losses and a provision for unfunded lending commitments. The provision for credit losses reported in the above table relates only to the provision for loan and lease losses. It does not include the provision for unfunded lending commitments of $52 million in 2013, and the provision release for unfunded lending commitments of $31 and $41 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively. (2) Consists of a reduction in the allowance of $289 million, which was attributable to the Portfolio Sale, in the first quarter of 2013. It also contains a foreign translation and other adjustment of $19 million, $15 million, and $8 million in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.

The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans, excluding the allowance related to our domestic credit card loans, was 170.59% as of December 31, 2013 and 154.65% as of December 31, 2012. 105 Table of Contents Our allowance decreased by $841 million to $4.3 billion as of December 31, 2013 from $5.2 billion as of December 31, 2012. The reduction in the allowance was mainly due to a reduction in loan balances, an improved credit outlook, and an allowance transfer of $289 million related to the Portfolio Sale. LIQUIDITY RISK PROFILE We have established liquidity guidelines that are intended to ensure we have sufficient asset-based liquidity to withstand the potential impact of deposit attrition or diminished liquidity in the funding markets. Our guidelines include maintaining an adequate liquidity reserve to cover our potential funding requirements and diversified funding sources to avoid over-dependence on volatile, less reliable funding markets. Our liquidity reserves consist of readily-marketable or pledgable assets which can be used as a source of liquidity, if needed. Table 26 below presents the composition of our liquidity reserves as of December 31, 2013 and 2012. Table 26: Liquidity Reserves (Dollars in millions) December 31, 2013 December 31, 2012 Cash and cash equivalents $ 6,291 $ 11,058 Investment securities available for sale, at fair value (1) 41,800 63,979 Investment securities held to maturity, at fair value (1) 19,185 9 Total investment securities portfolio 60,985 63,988 FHLB borrowing capacity secured by loans 28,623 32,578 Outstanding FHLB advances and letters of credit secured by loans (8,917 ) (15,716 ) Outstanding FHLB advances and letters of credit secured by securities (7,808 ) (5,500 ) Securities encumbered for Public Funds and others (9,491 ) (8,311 ) Total liquidity reserves $ 69,683 $ 78,097 (1) The weighted average life of our securities was approximately 6.3 years and 4.3 years as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our liquidity reserves decreased by $8.4 billion, or 11%, in 2013, to $69.7 billion as of December 31, 2013 from $78.1 billion in 2012. This decrease was primarily attributable to the redemption of $3.7 billion in trust preferred securities on January 2, 2013, a reduction in the market value of our securities portfolio holdings due to higher interest rates, and a decrease in our FHLB borrowing capacity secured by loans, partially offset by a reduction in our outstanding FHLB advances. See MD&A Risk Management for additional information on our management of liquidity risk. Funding Our funding objective is to establish an appropriate maturity profile using a cost-effective mix of both short-term and long-term funds. We use a variety of funding sources, including deposits, short-term borrowings, the issuance of senior and subordinated notes and other borrowings, and loan securitization transactions. In addition, we utilize FHLB advances, which are secured by certain portions of our loan and investment securities portfolios, for our funding needs. Deposits Our deposits provide a stable and relatively low cost of funds and are our largest source of funding. Table 27 provides a comparison of the composition of our deposits, average balances, interest expense and average deposit rates for 2013, 2012 and 2011. 106 Table of Contents Table 27: Deposit Composition and Average Deposit Rates December 31, 2013 (Dollars in millions) Period End Balance Average Balance Interest Expense % of Average Deposits Average Deposit Rate Non-interest bearing $ 22,643 $ 21,345 N/A 10.2 % N/A Negotiable order of withdrawal ( NOW ) accounts 43,880 43,823 $ 254 21.0 0.58 % Money market deposit accounts 98,403 101,848 648 48.6 0.64 Savings accounts 29,264 27,525 66 13.2 0.24 Consumer time deposits less than $100,000 6,299 8,955 161 4.3 1.80 Total core deposits 200,489 203,496 1,129 97.3 0.55 Certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more 2,852 3,938 108 1.9 2.74 Foreign time deposits 1,182 1,611 4 0.8 0.25 Total customer deposits $ 204,523 $ 209,045 $ 1,241 100.0 % 0.59 % December 31, 2012 (Dollars in millions) Period End Balance Average Balance Interest Expense % of Average Deposits Average Deposit Rate Non-interest bearing $ 22,467 $ 19,741 N/A 9.7 % N/A Negotiable order of withdrawal ( NOW ) accounts 40,591 34,179 $ 212 16.8 0.62 % Money market deposit accounts 104,540 99,734 684 49.1 0.69 Savings accounts 28,285 30,457 101 15.0 0.33 Consumer time deposits less than $100,000 11,028 12,762 258 6.4 2.02 Total core deposits 206,911 196,873 1,255 97.0 0.64 Certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more 4,495 4,876 144 2.4 2.95 Foreign time deposits 1,079 1,305 4 0.6 0.31 Total customer deposits $ 212,485 $ 203,054 $ 1,403 100.0 % 0.69 % December 31, 2011 (Dollars in millions) Period End Balance Average Balance Interest Expense % of Average Deposits Average Deposit Rate Non-interest bearing $ 18,281 $ 17,051 N/A 13.5 % N/A Negotiable order of withdrawal ( NOW ) accounts 15,038 13,285 $ 41 10.5 0.31 % Money market deposit accounts 46,496 46,455 396 36.6 0.85 Savings accounts 31,433 29,640 218 23.4 0.74 Consumer time deposits less than $100,000 11,471 13,855 351 10.9 2.53 Total core deposits 122,719 120,286 1,006 94.9 0.84 Certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more 4,586 5,634 177 4.5 3.14 Foreign time deposits 921 774 4 0.6 0.52 Total customer deposits $ 128,226 $ 126,694 $ 1,187 100.0 % 0.94 % 107 Table of Contents Total customer deposits decreased by $8.0 billion during 2013 to $204.5 billion as of December 31, 2013, from $212.5 billion as of December 31, 2012 as we allowed some higher yielding deposits to run off given our balance sheet needs. Our deposits include brokered deposits, which we obtained through the use of third-party intermediaries. Brokered deposits are reported in money market deposit accounts and consumer time deposits in the above table. Brokered deposits totaled $6.0 billion, or 3% of total deposits, as of December 31, 2013. Brokered deposits totaled $10.0 billion, or 5% of total deposits, as of December 31, 2012. FDICIA limits the use of brokered deposits to well-capitalized insured depository institutions and, with a waiver from the FDIC, to adequately capitalized institutions. COBNA and CONA were well-capitalized, as defined under the federal banking regulatory guidelines, as of both December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, and therefore were permitted to maintain brokered deposits. Table 28 presents the contractual maturities of large-denomination time deposits of $100,000 or more. Our funding and liquidity management activities factor into the expected maturities of these deposits. Based on past activity, we expect to retain a portion of these deposits as they mature. Accordingly, we expect the actual net cash outflows will be less than the contractual maturity amounts.

Other Funding Sources We also access the capital markets to meet our funding needs through the use of the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, loan securitization transactions, and federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. We participate in the federal funds market regularly to take advantage of attractive offers and to keep a visible presence in the market, which is intended to ensure that we are able to access the federal funds market in a time of need. In addition, we may utilize short-term as well as long-term FHLB advances for our funding needs. FHLB advances are secured by our investment securities, residential home loans, multifamily loans, commercial real-estate loans and home equity lines of credit. Other debt, which consists of federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, senior and subordinated notes and other borrowings and FHLB advances, but excluding securitized debt obligations, totaled $30.4 billion as of December 31, 2013, of which $16.2 billion represented short-term borrowings and $14.2 billion represented long-term debt. Other debt decreased by $8.1 billion in 2013 from a total $38.5 billion as of December 31, 2012, of which $21.1 billion represented short-term borrowings and $17.4 billion represented long-term borrowings. 108 Table of Contents Table 29 provides information on short-term borrowings, which consist of borrowings with an original contractual maturity of one year or less and therefore does not include the current portion of long-term debt. Our short-term borrowings typically have not represented a significant portion of our overall funding.

Borrowing Capacity Under our shelf registration statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on April 30, 2012, from time to time, we may offer and sell an indeterminate aggregate amount of senior or subordinated debt securities, preferred stock, depository shares, common stock, purchase contracts, warrants and units. There is no limit under this shelf registration statement to the amount or number of such securities that we may offer and sell, subject to market conditions. Our current shelf registration statement will expire three years from the filing date. In addition to our issuance capacity under the shelf registration statement, we also have access to FHLB advances with a maximum borrowing capacity of $37.1 billion as of December 31, 2013. This borrowing capacity was secured by posting $28.6 billion of loans and $8.5 billion of securities as collateral. We had outstanding FHLB advances and letters of credit of $16.7 billion as of December 31, 2013, and $20.4 billion still available to us to borrow under this program. The ability to draw down funding is based on membership status and the amount is dependent upon the Banks ability to post collateral. Our FHLB membership is secured by our investment in FHLB stock of $774 million and $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, which are determined based on our outstanding advances. Credit Ratings Our credit ratings have a significant impact on our ability to access capital markets and our borrowing costs. Rating agencies base their ratings on numerous factors, including liquidity, capital adequacy, asset quality, quality of earnings and the probability of systemic support. Significant changes in these factors could result in different ratings. Such ratings help to support our cost effective unsecured funding as part of our overall financing programs. Table 31 provides a summary of the credit ratings for the senior unsecured debt of Capital One Financial Corporation, COBNA and CONA as of December 31, 2013 and 2012.

Contractual Obligations In the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments that affect our short- and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. Our future cash outflows primarily relate to deposits, borrowings and operating leases. Table 32 summarizes, by remaining contractual maturity, our significant contractual cash obligations based on the undiscounted future cash payments as of December 31, 2013. The actual timing and amounts of future cash payments may differ from the amounts presented below due to a number of factors, such as discretionary debt repurchases. Table 32 excludes certain obligations where the obligation is short-term or subject to valuation based on market factors, such as trade payables and trading liabilities. The table also excludes the representation and warranty reserve of $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2013 and obligations for pension and post-retirement benefit plans, which obligations are discussed in more detail in Note 16 Employee Benefit Plans. 110 Table of Contents Table 32: Contractual Obligations December 31, 2013 (Dollars in millions) Up to 1 Year > 1 Years to 3 Years > 3 Years to 5 Years > 5 Years Total Interest-bearing time deposits (1) $ 6,348 $ 2,983 $ 879 $ 123 $ 10,333 Securitized debt obligations 2,958 4,022 3,095 214 10,289 Other debt: Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase 915 915 Senior and subordinated notes 2,385 5,253 2,058 3,438 13,134 Other borrowings (2) 16,243 39 30 4 16,316 Total other debt 19,543 5,292 2,088 3,442 30,365 Operating leases 245 440 365 752 1,802 Purchase obligations (3)(4) 179 257 110 9 555 Total $ 29,273 $ 12,994 $ 6,537 $ 4,540 $ 53,344 (1) Includes only those interest-bearing deposits which have a contractual maturity date.

(4) Excludes funding commitments entered into in the ordinary course of business. See Note 20 Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees, and Others for further details. MARKET RISK PROFILE Market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities, including loans, deposits, securities, short-term borrowings, long-term debt and derivatives. Below we provide additional information about our primary sources of market risk, our market risk management strategies and the measures we use to evaluate our market risk exposure. Primary Market Risk Exposures Our primary source of market risk is interest rate risk. We also have exposure to foreign exchange risk. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk, which represents exposure to instruments whose yield or price varies with the level or volatility of interest rates, is our most significant source of market risk exposure. Banks are inevitably exposed to interest rate risk due to differences in the timing between the maturities or repricing of assets and liabilities. Foreign Exchange Risk Foreign exchange risk represents exposure to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in other currencies. Changes in foreign exchange rates affect the reported earnings of our foreign operations and the non-dollar denominated equity invested in those foreign operations. We measure our earnings exposure using a stress-based simulation of foreign exchange rates and manage it through the use of derivatives. As of December 31, 2013 our earnings exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates was less than 2%. The impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our non-dollar equity invested overseas, measured on a quarterly basis, manifests itself in our AOCI and capital ratios. 111 Table of Contents Market Risk Management We employ several techniques to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk, which include, but are not limited to, altering the duration and re-pricing characteristics of our various assets and liabilities through interest rate derivatives. Derivatives are one of the primary tools we use in managing interest rate and foreign exchange risk. Our current asset/liability management policy includes the use of derivatives to hedge material foreign currency denominated transactions to limit our earnings exposure to foreign exchange risk. We execute our derivative contracts in both over-the-counter and exchange-traded derivative markets. Although the majority of our derivatives are interest rate swaps, we also use a variety of other derivative instruments, including caps, floors, options, futures and forward contracts, to manage both our interest rate and foreign currency risk. The outstanding notional amount of our derivative contracts totaled $63.4 billion as of December 31, 2013, compared with $57.8 billion as of December 31, 2012. Market Risk Measurement We have prescribed risk management policies and limits established by our Market and Liquidity Risk Policy and approved by the Board of Directors. Our objective is to manage our asset/liability risk position and exposure to market risk in accordance with these policies and prescribed limits based on prevailing market conditions and long-term expectations. Because no single measure can reflect all aspects of market risk, we use various industry standard market risk measurement techniques and analyses to measure, assess and manage the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on our net interest income and our economic value of equity. See MD&A Economic Value of Equity . We consider the impact on both net interest income and economic value of equity in measuring and managing our interest rate risk. Because the federal funds rate was lowered to near zero in December 2008 and since then has remained in a target range of zero to 0.25%, we use a 50 basis point decrease as our declining interest rate scenario, since a scenario where interest rates would decline by 200 basis points is not plausible. In scenarios where a 50 basis point decline would result in a rate less than 0%, we assume a rate of 0%. Below we discuss the assumptions used in calculating each of these measures. Net Interest Income Sensitivity Our net interest income sensitivity measure estimates the impact on our projected 12-month base-line adjusted net interest income resulting from movements in interest rates. Adjusted net interest income consists of net interest income and changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, including related derivative hedging activity, and changes in the fair value of free-standing interest rate swaps. In addition to our existing assets and liabilities, we incorporate expected future business growth assumptions, such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, and plans for projected changes in our funding mix in our baseline forecast. In measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our adjusted projected net interest income, we assume an instantaneous plus 200 basis point and minus 50 basis point shock, with the lower rate scenario limited to zero as described above. Economic Value of Equity Our economic value of equity sensitivity measure estimates the impact on the net present value of our assets and liabilities, including derivative hedging activity, resulting from movements in interest rates. Our economic value of equity sensitivity measures are calculated based on our existing assets and liabilities, including derivatives, and do not incorporate business growth assumptions or projected plans for funding mix changes. In measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our economic value of equity, we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates of plus 200 basis points and minus 50 basis points to spot rates. 112 Table of Contents In the third quarter of 2013 we updated models and associated assumptions for our direct deposits, mortgage loan and investment security prepayments which impacted our net interest income and economic value of equity sensitivity metrics. Our new direct deposit model was developed on account level data and incorporates lagged responses in both repricing and customer behavior as external market rates change. Additionally, we have updated our mortgage prepayment model. The modeling changes had a small impact on our economic value of equity sensitivity measure, but resulted in a larger impact to our next 12-month net interest income sensitivity, driven primarily from the deposit model change. We have included the table below that shows net interest income and economic value of equity sensitivity as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012. Table 33 shows the estimated percentage impact on our projected base-line adjusted net interest income and economic value of equity, calculated under the hypothetical interest rate scenarios described above, as of December 31, 2013 and 2012. In addition to these industry standard measures, we will continue to factor into our internal interest rate risk management decisions the potential impact of alternative interest rate scenarios, such as stressed rate shocks as well as steepening and flattening yield curve scenarios. Table 33: Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis (Dollars in millions) December 31, 2013 December 31, 2012 (1) Impact on projected base-line adjusted net interest income: +200 basis points 4.9 % 2.7 % -50 basis points (1.5 ) (1.7 ) Impact on economic value of equity: +200 basis points (5.7 ) (3.1 ) -50 basis points 0.3 (1.4 ) (1) The measurement as of December 31, 2012 was not adjusted retrospectively for the new model change implemented in 2013. Our projected net interest income and economic value of equity sensitivity measures were within our prescribed asset/liability policy limits as of December 31, 2013 and 2012. Limitations of Market Risk Measures The interest rate risk models that we use in deriving these measures incorporate contractual information, internally-developed assumptions and proprietary modeling methodologies, which project borrower and depositor behavior patterns in certain interest rate environments. Other market inputs, such as interest rates, market prices and interest rate volatility, are also critical components of our interest rate risk measures. We regularly evaluate, update and enhance these assumptions, models and analytical tools as we believe appropriate to reflect our best assessment of the market environment and the expected behavior patterns of our existing assets and liabilities. There are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates. The above sensitivity analysis contemplate only certain movements in interest rates and are performed at a particular point in time based on the existing balance sheet and, in some cases, expected future business growth and funding mix assumptions. The strategic actions that management may take to manage our balance sheet may differ significantly from our projections, which could cause our actual earnings and economic value of equity sensitivities to differ substantially from the above sensitivity analysis. 113 Table of Contents SUPPLEMENTAL TABLES See Part II- Item 6. Selected Financial Data for information on our supplemental non-GAAP managed results, which we presented prior to our January 1, 2010 prospective adoption of the new consolidation standards.

(collectively, HSBC ), we closed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and assumed liabilities of HSBC credit card and private label credit card business in the United States (other than the HSBC Bank USA, consumer credit card program and certain other retained assets and liabilities). Acquired Loans: A limited portion of the credit card loans acquired in the 2012 U.S. card acquisition and the substantial majority of consumer and commercial loans acquired in the ING Direct and Chevy Chase Bank acquisitions, which were recorded at fair value at acquisition and subsequently accounted for based on expected cash flows to be collected (under the accounting standard formerly known as Statement of Position 03-3, Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer , commonly referred to as SOP 03-3 ). The difference between the fair value at acquisition and expected cash flows represents the accretable yield, which is recognized into interest income over the life of the loans. The difference between the contractual payments on the loans and expected cash flows represents the nonaccretable difference or the amount of principal and interest not considered collectible, which incorporates future expected credit losses over the life of the loans. Decreases in expected cash flows resulting from further credit deterioration will generally result in an impairment charge recognized in our provision for credit losses and an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses. Charge-offs are not recorded until the expected credit losses within the nonaccretable difference is depleted. In addition, Acquired Loans are not classified as delinquent or nonperforming as we expect to collect our net investment in these loans and the nonaccretable difference will absorb the majority of the losses associated with these loans.

Benefit obligation and Projected Benefit Obligation: Benefit Obligation refers to the total of the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations. Projected Benefit Obligation represents actuarial present value of all benefits accrued on employee service rendered prior to the calculation date, including allowance for future salary increases if the pension benefit is based on future compensation levels. BHC Act: The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (12 U.S.C. 1842). Capital One: Capital One Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries. Carrying Value (with respect to loans) : The amount at which a loan is recorded on the balance sheet. For loans recorded at amortized cost, carrying value is the unpaid principal balance net of unamortized deferred loan origination fees and costs, and unamortized purchase premium or discount. For loans that are or have been on nonaccrual status, the carrying value is also reduced by any net charge-offs that have been recorded and the amount of interest payments applied as a reduction of principal under the cost recovery method. For credit card loans, the carrying value also includes interest that has been billed to the customer. For loans classified as held-for-sale, carrying value is the lower of carrying value as described in the sentences above, or fair value.
