Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further detail on current year results. United States U.S. Resource Plays Eagle Ford We have been operating in the South Texas Eagle Ford play since 2011, where roughly two thirds of our acreage is located in Karnes and Atascosa Counties. Our focus is capital efficient development with a goal of maximizing returns and cash flow generation while extending our core acreage. We operate 32 central gathering and treating facilities across the play that support more than 1,600 producing wells. We also own and operate the Sugarloaf gathering system, a 42-mile natural gas pipeline through the heart of our acreage in Karnes and Atascosa Counties. Bakken We have been operating in the Williston Basin since 2006. The majority of our core acreage is within McKenzie, Mountrail, and Dunn Counties in North Dakota targeting the Middle Bakken and Three Forks reservoirs. We continue focusing our investment in our high-return Myrmidon and Hector areas, while also delineating our position across the rest of our acreage. Oklahoma With a history in Oklahoma that dates back more than 100 years, our primary focus has recently been the transition to early infill development in the STACK Meramec and SCOOP Woodford, while progressing delineation of other plays across our footprint. We primarily hold net acreage with rights to the Woodford, Springer, Meramec, Osage and other prospect intervals, with a majority of this in the SCOOP and STACK. Northern Delaware We have been operating in the Northern Delaware basin, which is located within the greater Permian area, since we closed on two major acquisitions in 2017. These acquisitions gave us a strong foundational footprint in the region where we have the majority of our acreage in Eddy and Lea counties primarily in the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring New Mexico plays. Our focus since entering the play has been to strategically advance our position and prepare for future development by further coring up our footprint, progressing early delineation of our acreage, improving our cost structure and securing midstream solutions. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail. Other United States Our remaining properties in the United States primarily consist of our newly acquired acreage in the emerging Louisiana Austin Chalk play and outside operated assets in the Gulf of Mexico, including our 3.5% overriding royalty interest in the Ursa fields. During 2018 we acquired approximately 260,000 net acres in the Louisiana Austin Chalk play at a cost of less than $850 per acre. Additionally, in the fourth quarter 2018, we entered into an agreement to sell our working interest in the Droshky field, in the Gulf of Mexico, and as a result it is classified as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2018 . This transaction closed in the first quarter of 2019. During 2018 we closed on the sale of several non-core conventional properties, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail. International Segment We are engaged in oil and gas development and production across our international locations primarily in E.G. and U.K. We include the results of our LPG processing plant, gas liquefaction operations and methanol production operations in E.G. in our International segment. International Equatorial Guinea We own a 63% operated working interest under a production sharing contract in the Alba field and an 80% operated working interest in Block D, both of which are offshore E.G. Operational availability from our company-operated facilities averaged approximately 97% in 2018 . Equatorial Guinea Gas Processing We own a 52% interest in Alba Plant LLC, accounted for as an equity method investment, which operates an onshore LPG processing plant located on Bioko Island. Alba field natural gas, under a long-term contract at a fixed price per btu, is processed by the LPG plant. The LPG plant extracts secondary condensate and LPG from the natural gas stream and uses some of the remaining dry natural gas in its operations. We also own 60% of EGHoldings and 45% of AMPCO, both accounted for as equity method investments. EGHoldings operates a 3.7 mmta LNG production facility and AMPCO operates a methanol plant, both located on Bioko Island. These facilities allow us to further monetize natural gas production from the Alba field. The LNG production facility sells LNG under a 3.4 mmta sales and purchase agreement. Under the agreement, which runs through 2023, the purchaser takes delivery of the LNG on Bioko Island, with pricing linked principally to the Henry Hub index. Gross sales of LNG from this production facility 6 totaled approximately 3.5 mmta in 2018 . AMPCO had gross sales totaling approximately 1,000 mt in 2018 . Methanol production is sold to customers in Europe and the U.S. United Kingdom Our operated assets in the U.K. sector of the North Sea are the Brae area complex where we have a 42% working interest in the South, Central, North and West Brae fields, a 39% working interest in the East Brae field, and a 28% working interest in the nearby Braemar field. We own non-operated working interests in the Foinaven area complex, consisting of a 28% working interest in the main Foinaven field, a 47% working interest in East Foinaven and a 20% working interest in the T35 and T25 fields. Libya In the first quarter of 2018 , we closed on the sale of our subsidiary, Marathon Oil Libya Limited, which held our 16.33% non-operated interest in the Waha concessions in Libya. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail. Other International Kurdistan Region of Iraq We have a non-operated 15% working interest in the Atrush block located north-northwest of Erbil. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we entered into an agreement to sell our Kurdistan subsidiary, Marathon Oil KDV B.V., and as a result it is classified as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2018 . We expect this transaction to close in the first half of 2019 which will complete our full country exit from Kurdistan. Additionally during 2018, we entered into separate agreements to sell certain non-core properties in our International segment. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for information about these dispositions. Reserves Proved reserves are required to be disclosed by continent and by country if the proved reserves related to any geographic area, on an oil equivalent barrel basis, represent 15% or more of our total proved reserves. A geographic area can be an individual country, group of countries within a continent or a continent. Other International ("Other Int l"), includes the U.K. and the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. Approximately 86% of our proved reserves are located in OECD countries, with 84% located within the U.S. The following tables set forth estimated quantities of our total proved crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas reserves based upon SEC pricing for period ended December 31, 2018 .

In the case of undeveloped properties, an investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisition. Drilling title opinions are usually prepared before commencement of drilling operations. Our title to properties may be subject to burdens such as royalty, overriding royalty, carried, net profits, working and other similar interests and contractual arrangements customary in the industry. In addition, our interests may be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws or burdens such as net profits interests, liens related to operating agreements, development obligations or capital commitments under international production sharing contracts or exploration licenses.

(b) Primarily represents fixed prices under long-term contracts with Alba Plant LLC, AMPCO and/or EGHoldings, which are equity method investees. We include our share of income from each of these equity method investees in our International Segment. Marketing Our reportable operating segments include activities related to the marketing and transportation of substantially all of our crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas. These activities include the transportation of production to market centers, the sale of commodities to third parties and the storage of production. We balance our various sales, storage and transportation positions in order to aggregate volumes to satisfy transportation commitments and to achieve flexibility within product types and delivery points. Such activities can include the purchase of commodities from third parties for resale. Gross Delivery Commitments We have committed to deliver gross quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas to customers under a variety of contracts. As of December 31, 2018 , the contracts for fixed and determinable quantities were at variable, market-based pricing and related primarily to the following commitments: 2019 2020 2021 Thereafter Commitment Period Through Eagle Ford Crude and condensate (mbbld) 65 51 2020 Natural gas liquids (mbbld) 1 2020 Natural gas (mmcfd) 120 120 56 36 2022 Bakken Crude and condensate (mbbld) 10 10 10 5 - 10 2027 Natural gas (mmcfd) 3 3 3 3 - 25 2028 Northern Delaware Crude and condensate (mbbld) 21 19 2020 All of these contracts provide the options of delivering third-party volumes or paying a monetary shortfall penalty if production is inadequate to satisfy our commitment. In addition to the contracts discussed above, we have entered into numerous agreements for transportation and processing of our equity production. Some of these contracts have volumetric requirements which could require monetary shortfall penalties if our production is inadequate to meet the terms. 11 Competition Competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry and we compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies. We compete, in particular, in the exploration for and development of new reserves, acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties, the marketing and delivery of our production into worldwide commodity markets and for the labor and equipment required for exploration and development of those properties. Principal methods of competing include geological, geophysical, and engineering research and technology, experience and expertise, economic analysis in connection with portfolio management, and safely operating oil and gas producing properties. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for discussion of specific areas in which we compete and related risks. Environmental, Health and Safety Matters The Health, Environmental, Safety and Corporate Responsibility Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing our position on public issues, including environmental, health and safety matters. Our Corporate Health, Environment, Safety and Security organization has the responsibility to ensure that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that support and foster our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Committees comprised of certain of our officers review our overall performance associated with various environmental compliance programs. We also have a Corporate Emergency Response Team which oversees our response to any major environmental or other emergency incident involving us or any of our properties. Our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, health and safety at the national, state and local levels. These laws and their implementing regulations and other similar state and local laws and rules can impose certain operational controls for minimization of pollution or recordkeeping, monitoring and reporting requirements or other operational or siting constraints on our business, result in costs to remediate releases of regulated substances, including crude oil, into the environment, or require costs to remediate sites to which we sent regulated substances for disposal. In some cases, these laws can impose strict liability for the entire cost of clean-up on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others (such as prior owners or operators of our assets) or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. We have incurred and will continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. New laws have been enacted and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis and the costs of compliance with these new laws and regulations can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more defined. For a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Management Discussion and Analysis of Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies . Air and Climate Change Environmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies in the United States and other countries have focused considerable attention on the emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases and their potential role in climate change. Developments in greenhouse gas initiatives may affect us and other similarly situated companies operating in the oil and gas industry. As part of our commitment to environmental stewardship, we estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations. We are working to continuously improve the accuracy and completeness of these estimates. In addition, we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable and cost effective. Government entities and other groups have filed lawsuits in several states and other jurisdictions seeking to hold a wide variety of companies that produce fossil fuels liable for the alleged impacts of the greenhouse gas emissions attributable to those fuels. The lawsuits allege damages as a result of global warming and the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and abatement under various tort theories. Marathon Oil has been named as a defendant in several of these lawsuits, along with numerous other companies. Similar lawsuits may be filed in other jurisdictions. While the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the claims made against us are without merit and will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow. The EPA finalized a more stringent National Ambient Air Quality Standard ( NAAQS ) for ozone in October 2015. States that contain any areas designated as non-attainment, and any tribes that choose to do so, will be required to complete development of implementation plans in the 2020-2021 time frame. The EPA may in the future designate additional areas as non-attainment, including areas in which we operate, which may result in an increase in costs for emission controls and requirements for additional monitoring and testing, as well as a more cumbersome permitting process. Although there may be 12 an adverse financial impact (including compliance costs, potential permitting delays and increased regulatory requirements) associated with this revised regulation, the extent and magnitude of that impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the present uncertainty regarding any additional measures and how they will be implemented. The EPA's final rule has been judicially challenged by both industry and other interested parties, and the outcome of this litigation may also impact implementation and revisions to the rule. In November 2016, the Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) issued a final rule to further restrict venting and/or flaring of gas from facilities subject to BLM jurisdiction, and to modify certain royalty requirements. BLM issued a two-year stay of these requirements in December 2017. In September 2018, BLM published a final rule to rescind substantial portions of the rule. The rescission was challenged by multiple parties in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. If the judicial challenges to the rule are successful and the rule were to come back into effect, the requirements would result in additional costs of compliance as well as increased monitoring, recordkeeping and recording for some of our facilities. Hydraulic Fracturing Hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injecting water, sand and small volumes of chemicals into the wellbore to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock thousands of feet below the surface to facilitate higher flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. Our business uses this technique extensively throughout our operations. Hydraulic fracturing has been regulated at the state and local level through permitting and compliance requirements. Various state and local-level initiatives in regions with substantial shale resources have been or may be proposed or implemented to further regulate hydraulic fracturing practices, limit water withdrawals and water use, require disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents, restrict which additives may be used, or implement temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing. Water In 2014, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers published proposed regulations which expand the surface waters that are regulated under the federal Clean Water Act ( CWA ) and its various programs. While these regulations were finalized largely as proposed in 2015, the rule has been stayed by the courts pending a substantive decision on the merits. In December 2018, EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers issued a proposed rule that, if finalized, would amend the 2015 regulations to narrow the scope of federal CWA jurisdiction. If the new proposed rule is not finalized and the 2015 rule is ultimately implemented, the expansion of CWA jurisdiction will result in additional costs of compliance as well as increased monitoring, recordkeeping and recording for some of our facilities. For additional information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors . Concentrations of Credit Risk We are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by counterparties, a significant portion of which are concentrated in energy-related industries. The creditworthiness of customers and other counterparties is subject to continuing review, including the use of master netting agreements, where appropriate. In 2018 , sales to Valero Marketing and Supply and Flint Hills Resources and each of their respective affiliates, each accounted for approximately 11% of our total revenues. In 2017 , sales to Vitol and each of their respective affiliates accounted for approximately 10% of our total revenues. In 2016 , sales to Valero Marketing and Supply, Tesoro Petroleum, and Flint Hills Resources and each of their respective affiliates accounted for approximately 13% , 11% and 10% of our total revenues. Trademarks, Patents and Licenses We currently hold U.S. and foreign patents. Although in the aggregate our trademarks and patents are important to us, we do not regard any single trademark, patent, or group of related trademarks or patents as critical or essential to our business as a whole.

Item 1A. Risk Factors We are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. The following summarizes significant risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. When considering an investment in our securities, you should carefully consider the risk factors included below as well as those matters referenced in the foregoing pages under "Disclosures Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" and other information included and incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A substantial decline in crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas prices would reduce our operating results and cash flows and could adversely impact our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets. The markets for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future, causing prices to fluctuate widely. Our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas. Many of the factors influencing prices of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas are beyond our control. These factors include: worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas; the cost of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas; the ability of the members of OPEC and certain non-OPEC members, such as Russia, to agree to and maintain production controls; the production levels of non-OPEC countries, including production levels in the shale plays in the United States; the level of drilling, completion and production activities by other exploration and production companies, and variability therein, in response to market conditions; political instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions; changes in weather patterns and climate; natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes; the price and availability of alternative and competing forms of energy; the effect of conservation efforts; epidemics or pandemics; technological advances affecting energy consumption and energy supply; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and general economic conditions worldwide. The long-term effects of these and other factors on the prices of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas are uncertain. Historical declines in commodity prices have adversely affected our business by: reducing the amount of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas that we can produce economically; reducing our revenues, operating income and cash flows; causing us to reduce our capital expenditures, and delay or postpone some of our capital projects; 15 requiring us to impair the carrying value of our assets; reducing the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas; and increasing the costs of obtaining capital, such as equity and short- and long-term debt. Estimates of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas reserves depend on many factors and assumptions, including various assumptions that are based on conditions in existence as of the dates of the estimates. Any material changes in those conditions or other factors affecting those assumptions could impair the quantity and value of our reserves. The proved reserve information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been derived from engineering and geoscience estimates. Estimates of crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and our historical synthetic crude oil reserves were prepared, in accordance with SEC regulations, by our in-house teams of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals and were reviewed and approved by our Corporate Reserves Group and third-party consultants. Reserves were valued based on SEC pricing for the periods ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , as well as other conditions in existence at those dates. The table below provides the 2018 SEC pricing for certain benchmark prices: 2018 SEC Pricing WTI Crude oil (per bbl) $ 65.56 Henry Hub natural gas (per mmbtu) $ 3.05 Brent crude oil (per bbl) $ 72.70 Mont Belvieu NGLs (per bbl) $ 26.63 If annual SEC crude oil benchmark prices (see table above) were to decrease to approximately $45 per bbl, or 30% below average prices used to estimate 2018 proved reserves, we would not expect price related reserve revisions to have a material impact on proved reserve volumes. Future reserve revisions could also result from changes in capital funding, drilling plans and governmental regulation, among other things. Reserve estimation is a subjective process that involves estimating volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas that cannot be directly measured. Estimates of economically producible reserves and of future net cash flows depend on a number of variable factors and assumptions, including: location, size and shape of the accumulation as well as fluid, rock and producing characteristics of the accumulation; historical production from the area, compared with production from other analogous producing areas; the assumed impacts of regulation by governmental agencies; assumptions concerning future operating costs, taxes, development costs and workover and repair costs; and industry economic conditions, levels of cash flows from operations and other operating considerations. As a result, different petroleum engineers and geoscientists, each using industry-accepted geologic and engineering practices and scientific methods, may produce different estimates of proved reserves and future net cash flows based on the same available data. Because of the subjective nature of such reserve estimates, each of the following items may differ materially from the estimated amounts: the amount and timing of production; the revenues and costs associated with that production; and the amount and timing of future development expenditures. 16 If we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional reserves, our future crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas production would decline, thereby reducing our cash flows and results of operations and impairing our financial condition. The rate of production from crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted. Except to the extent we acquire interests in additional properties containing proved reserves, conduct successful exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies, optimize production performance or identify additional reservoirs not currently producing or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline materially as crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas are produced. Accordingly, to the extent we are not successful in replacing the crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas we produce, our future revenues will decline. Creating and maintaining an inventory of prospects for future production depends on many factors, including: obtaining rights to explore for, develop and produce crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas in promising areas; drilling success; the ability to complete projects timely and cost effectively; the ability to find or acquire additional proved reserves at acceptable costs; and the ability to fund such activity. Future exploration and drilling results are uncertain and involve substantial costs. Drilling for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive reservoirs. The costs of drilling, completing and operating wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including: unexpected drilling conditions; title problems; pressure or irregularities in formations; equipment failures or accidents; inflation in exploration and drilling costs; fires, explosions, blowouts or surface cratering; lack of, or disruption in, access to pipelines or other transportation methods; and shortages or delays in the availability of services or delivery of equipment. If crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas prices decrease, it could adversely affect the abilities of our counterparties to perform their obligations to us, including abandonment obligations, which could negatively impact our financial results. We often enter into arrangements to conduct certain business operations, such as oil and gas exploration and production, or transportation of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, with partners, co-working interest owners, and other counterparties in order to share risks associated with those operations. In addition, we market our products to a variety of purchasers. If commodity prices decrease, some of our counterparties may experience liquidity problems and may not be able to meet their financial and other obligations, including abandonment obligations, to us. The inability of our joint venture partners or co-working interest owners to fund their portion of the costs under our joint venture agreements and joint operating agreements, or the nonperformance by purchasers, contractors or other counterparties of their obligations to us, could negatively impact our operating results and cash flows. If we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs and in a timely manner, or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving drilling and completion activities, engineering, procurement and construction of facilities (including improvements and repairs to our existing facilities) could adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results. Delays in making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to supply certain products we produce. Such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: denial of or delay in receiving requisite regulatory approvals and/or permits; 17 unplanned increases in the cost of construction materials or labor; disruptions in transportation of components or construction materials; increased costs or operational delays resulting from shortages of water; adverse weather conditions, natural disasters or other events (such as equipment malfunctions, explosions, fires or spills) affecting our facilities, or those of vendors or suppliers; shortages of sufficiently skilled labor, or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages; market-related increases in a project debt or equity financing costs; and nonperformance by, or disputes with, vendors, suppliers, contractors or subcontractors. Any one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our capital projects. Our offshore operations involve special risks that could negatively impact us. Offshore operations present technological challenges and operating risks because of the marine environment. Activities in offshore operations may pose risks because of the physical distance to oilfield service infrastructure and service providers. Environmental remediation and other costs resulting from spills or releases may result in substantial liabilities. We may incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of compliance with and changes in environmental, health, safety and security laws and regulations, and, as a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Our businesses are subject to numerous laws, regulations and other requirements relating to the protection of the environment, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment such as the flaring of natural gas, waste management, pollution prevention, greenhouse gas emissions and the protection of endangered species as well as laws, regulations, and other requirements relating to public and employee safety and health and to facility security. We have incurred and may continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws, regulations, and other requirements. To the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products, our operating results will be adversely affected. The specific impact of these laws, regulations, and other requirements may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of operating facilities and production processes. We may also be required to make material expenditures to modify operations, install pollution control equipment, perform site clean-ups or curtail operations that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may become subject to liabilities that we currently do not anticipate in connection with new, amended or more stringent requirements, stricter interpretations of existing requirements or the future discovery of contamination. In addition, any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws, regulations, and other requirements could result in civil penalties or criminal fines and other enforcement actions against us. We believe it is likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the extent, causes of and responsibility for climate change will continue, with the potential for further regulations that could affect our operations. Our operations result in greenhouse gas emissions. Currently, various legislative or regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides) are in various phases of review, discussion or implementation in countries where we operate, including the U.S. and the European Union. Internationally, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change finalized an agreement among 195 nations at the 21st Conference of the Parties in Paris with an overarching goal of preventing global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius. The agreement includes provisions that every country take some action to lower emissions, but there is no legal requirement for how or by what amount emissions should be lowered. The EPA has also finalized regulations targeting new sources of methane emissions from the oil and gas industry. Finalization of new legislation, regulations or international agreements in the future could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities, capital expenditures to install new emission controls at our facilities, and costs to administer and manage any potential greenhouse gas emissions or carbon trading or tax programs. These costs and capital expenditures could be material. Although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs, reduce the demand for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, and create delays in our obtaining air pollution permits for new or modified facilities. The potential adoption of federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased compliance costs, operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and gas wells. Hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injecting water, sand, and small volumes of chemicals into the wellbore to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock thousands of feet below the surface to facilitate higher flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. Our business uses this technique extensively throughout our U.S. operations. Hydraulic fracturing has been regulated at the state and local level through permitting and compliance requirements. Various state and local-level initiatives in regions with substantial shale resources have been or may be proposed or implemented to further 18 regulate hydraulic fracturing practices, limit water withdrawals and water use, require disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents, restrict which additives may be used, or implement temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing. In 2015 the BLM issued a rule governing certain hydraulic fracturing practices on lands within their jurisdiction; however, this rule was rescinded in December 2017. This rescission is being judicially challenged before the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, including from the shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs which could increase costs of our operations and cause considerable delays in acquiring regulatory approvals to drill and complete wells. The potential adoption of federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives intended to address potential induced seismic activity in the areas in which we operate could result in increased compliance costs, operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and gas wells. State and federal regulatory agencies have focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and gas waste disposal and seismic activity. When caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. Separate and apart from the referenced potential connection between injection wells and seismicity, concerns have been raised that hydraulic fracturing activities may be correlated to anomalous seismic events. Marathon uses hydraulic fracturing techniques throughout its U.S. operations. While the scientific community and regulatory agencies at all levels are continuing to study the possible linkage between oil and gas activity and induced seismicity, some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations or guidance to mitigate potential causes of induced seismicity. For example, Oklahoma has taken numerous regulatory actions in response to concerns related to the operation of produced water disposal wells and induced seismicity, and has issued guidelines to operators in certain areas of the State curtailing injection of produced water due to seismic concerns. Marathon does not currently own or operate injection wells or contract for such services in these areas. Further, Oklahoma issued guidelines to operators for management of anomalous seismicity that may be related to hydraulic fracturing activities in the SCOOP/STACK area. In addition, a number of lawsuits have been filed in Oklahoma alleging damage from seismicity relating to disposal well operations. Marathon has not been named in any of those lawsuits. Increased seismicity in Oklahoma or other areas could result in additional regulation and restrictions on our operations and could lead to operational delays or increased operating costs. Additional regulation and attention given to induced seismicity could also lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas activities. Our business could be negatively impacted by cyberattacks targeting our computer and telecommunications systems and infrastructure, or targeting those of our third-party service providers. Our business, like other companies in the oil and gas industry, has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies, including technologies that are managed by third-party service providers on whom we rely to help us collect, host or process information. Such technologies are integrated into our business operations and used as a part of our production and distribution systems in the U.S. and abroad, including those systems used to transport production to market, to enable communications, and to provide a host of other support services for our business. Use of the internet and other public networks for communications, services, and storage, including "cloud" computing, exposes all users (including our business) to cybersecurity risks. While we and our third-party service providers commit resources to the design, implementation, and monitoring of our information systems, there is no guarantee that our security measures will provide absolute security. Despite these security measures, we may not be able to anticipate, detect, or prevent cyberattacks, particularly because the methodologies used by attackers change frequently or may not be recognized until launched, and because attackers are increasingly using techniques designed to circumvent controls and avoid detection. We and our third-party service providers may therefore be vulnerable to security events that are beyond our control, and we may be the target of cyber-attacks, as well as physical attacks, which could result in information security breaches and significant disruption to our business. Our information systems and related infrastructure have experienced attempted and actual minor breaches of our cybersecurity in the past, but we have not suffered any losses or breaches which had a material effect on our business, operations or reputation relating to such attacks; however, there is no assurance that we will not suffer such losses or breaches in the future. As cyberattacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to respond to cyberattacks, to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures, or to investigate and remediate any information 19 systems and related infrastructure security vulnerabilities. We may also be subject to regulatory investigations or litigation relating from cybersecurity issues. Our level of indebtedness may limit our liquidity and financial flexibility. As of December 31, 2018 , our total debt was $5.5 billion , with our next debt maturity in the amount of $600 million due in 2020. Our indebtedness could have important consequences to our business, including, but not limited to, the following: we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions; a portion of our cash flows from operating activities must be used to service our indebtedness and is not available for other purposes; our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our industry may be limited; a financial covenant in our Credit Agreement stipulates that our total debt to capitalization ratio will not exceed 65% as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, and if exceeded, may make additional borrowings more expensive and affect our ability to plan for and react to changes in the economy and our industry; we may be at a competitive disadvantage as compared to similar companies that have less debt; and additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or development activities, general corporate or other purposes may have higher costs and more restrictive covenants. We may incur additional debt in order to fund our capital expenditures, acquisitions or development activities, or for general corporate or other purposes. A higher level of indebtedness increases the risk that our financial flexibility may deteriorate. Our ability to meet our debt obligations and service our debt depends on future performance. General economic conditions, crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas prices, and financial, business and other factors will affect our operations and our future performance. Many of these factors are beyond our control and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt, and future working capital, borrowings and equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of debt obligations. A downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital, which could adversely affect our business. We receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the United States. Due to the volatility in crude oil and U.S. natural gas prices in recent years, credit rating agencies review companies in the energy industry periodically, including us. At December 31, 2018 , our corporate credit ratings were: Standard & Poor's Global Ratings Services BBB- (positive); Fitch Ratings BBB (stable); and Moody's Investor Services, Inc. Ba1 (positive). The credit rating process is contingent upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. A downgrade of our credit ratings could negatively impact our cost of capital and our ability to access the capital markets, increase the interest rate and fees we pay on our revolving credit facility, and may limit or reduce credit lines with our bank counterparties. We could also be required to post letters of credit or other forms of collateral for certain contractual obligations, which could increase our costs and decrease our liquidity or letter of credit capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility. Limitations on our ability to access capital could adversely impact the level of our capital spending budget, our ability to manage our debt maturities, or our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. Our commodity price risk management activities may prevent us from fully benefiting from commodity price increases and may expose us to other risks, including counterparty risk. Global commodity prices are volatile. In order to mitigate commodity price volatility and increase the predictability of cash flows related to the marketing of our crude oil and natural gas, we, from time to time, enter into crude oil and natural gas hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production. While hedging arrangements are intended to mitigate commodity price volatility, we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of price increases above the price levels of the derivative instruments used to manage price risk. In addition, our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to perform under the contracts. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk . Worldwide political and economic developments and changes in law or policy could adversely affect our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows. Local political and economic factors in global markets could have a material adverse effect on us. A total of 29% of our crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas related to continuing operations in 2018 was derived from production outside the U.S. and 16% of our proved reserves of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas as of December 31, 2018 were located outside the U.S. We are, therefore, subject to the political, geographic and economic risks and possible terrorist 20 activities or other armed conflict attendant to doing business within or outside of the U.S. There are many risks associated with operations in countries such as E.G., and the Kurdistan Region of Iraq including: changes in governmental policies relating to crude oil and condensate, NGLs or natural gas and taxation; other political, economic or diplomatic developments and international monetary fluctuations; political and economic instability, war, acts of terrorism, armed conflict and civil disturbances; the possibility that a government may seize our property with or without compensation, may attempt to renegotiate or revoke existing contractual arrangements or may impose additional taxes or royalty burdens; and fluctuating currency values, hard currency shortages and currency controls. Changes in the U.S. or global political and economic environment or any U.S. or global hostility or the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks, or other armed conflict, could adversely affect the economies of the U.S. and other developed countries. A lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects. These risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas. In addition, these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate. These risks could also cause damage to, or the inability to access production facilities or other operating assets and could limit our service and equipment providers from delivering items necessary for us to conduct our operations. Actions of governments through tax legislation or interpretations of tax law, and other changes in law, executive order and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability, both in the U.S. and abroad. The U.S. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries. These restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate in, or gain access to, opportunities in various countries and will continue to do so in the future. Changes in law could also adversely affect our results, including new regulations resulting in higher costs to transport our production by pipeline, rail car, truck or vessel or the adoption of government payment transparency regulations that could require us to disclose competitively sensitive commercial information or that could cause us to violate the non-disclosure laws of other countries. Our operations may be adversely affected by pipeline, rail and other transportation capacity constraints. The marketability of our production depends in part on the availability, proximity, and capacity of pipeline facilities, rail cars, trucks and vessels. If any pipelines, rail cars, trucks or vessels become unavailable, we would, to the extent possible, be required to find a suitable alternative to transport our crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, which could increase the costs and/or reduce the revenues we might obtain from the sale of our production. Both the cost and availability of pipelines, rail cars, trucks, or vessels to transport our crude oil could be adversely impacted by new and expected state or federal regulations relating to transportation of crude oil. If we acquire crude oil and natural gas properties, our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems, to accurately estimate reserves, production rates or costs, or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We typically seek the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas properties and leases. Although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is diligent and consistent with industry practices, reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor may they permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to fully assess possible deficiencies and potential problems. Even when problems with a property are identified, we often assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements. Moreover, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas (as previously discussed), actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties. Actual reserves, production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates. In addition, an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations, particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations. We operate in a highly competitive industry, and many of our competitors are larger and have available resources in excess of our own. The oil and gas industry is highly competitive, and many competitors, including major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, are larger and have substantially greater resources at their disposal than we do. We compete with these companies for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. We also compete with these companies for equipment and personnel, including petroleum engineers, geologists, geophysicists and other specialists, required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural 21 gas to end-users. Such competition can significantly increase costs and affect the availability of resources, which could provide our larger competitors a competitive advantage when acquiring equipment, leases and other properties. They may also be able to use their greater resources to attract and retain experienced personnel. Many of our major projects and operations are conducted jointly with other parties, which may decrease our ability to manage risk. We often enter into arrangements to conduct certain business operations, such as oil and gas exploration and production with other parties in order to share risks associated with those operations. However, these arrangements also may decrease our ability to manage risks and costs, particularly where we are not the operator. We could have limited influence over and control of the behaviors and performance of these operations. In addition, misconduct, fraud, noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations or improper activities by or on behalf of one or more of our partners or co-working interest owners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. Our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses. We do not insure against all potential losses and therefore we could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities and increased costs. Our United States and International operations are subject to unplanned occurrences, including blowouts, explosions, fires, loss of well control, spills, tornadoes, hurricanes and other adverse weather, tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or nuclear or other disasters, labor disputes and accidents. These same risks can be applied to the third-parties which transport our products from our facilities. A prolonged disruption in the ability of any pipelines, rail cars, trucks, or vessels to transport our production could contribute to a business interruption or increase costs. Our operations are also subject to the additional hazards of pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks. These hazards could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property and equipment, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses to us. Various hazards have adversely affected us in the past, and damages resulting from a catastrophic occurrence in the future involving us or any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially large claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities. We maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from operating hazards in amounts that we believe to be prudent. Uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating hazards could reduce the funds available to us for capital, exploration and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Historically, we have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage including at times resulting business interruption to our major onshore and offshore facilities, with significant self-insured retentions. In the future, we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for our insurance policies will change over time and could escalate. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. For example, due to historical hurricane activity, the availability of insurance coverage for windstorms has changed and, in some instances, it is uneconomical. As a result, our exposure to losses from future windstorm activity has increased. Litigation by private plaintiffs or government officials or entities could adversely affect our performance. We currently are defending litigation and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation in the future. The subject matter of such litigation may include releases of hazardous substances from our facilities, privacy laws, contract disputes, royalty disputes or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations. In some cases the plaintiff or plaintiffs seek alleged damages involving large classes of potential litigants, and may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances. If we are not able to successfully defend such claims, they may result in substantial liability. We do not have insurance covering all of these potential liabilities. In addition to substantial liability, litigation may also seek injunctive relief which could have an adverse effect on our future operations. For instance, government entities and other groups have filed lawsuits in several states seeking to hold a wide variety of companies that produce fossil fuels liable for the alleged impacts of the greenhouse gas emissions attributable to those fuels. The lawsuits allege damages as a result of global warming and the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and abatement under various tort theories. Marathon Oil has been named as a defendant in several of these lawsuits, along with numerous other companies. Similar lawsuits may be filed in other jurisdictions. The ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, and we could incur substantial legal costs associated with defending these and similar lawsuits in the future. In connection with our separation from MPC, MPC agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. However, there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that MPC ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations will not be impaired in the future. 22 Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and the Tax Sharing Agreement we entered into with MPC in connection with the spin-off, MPC agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. However, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that MPC agreed to retain or assume, and there can be no assurance that the indemnification from MPC will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that MPC will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. In addition, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from MPC any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. The spin-off could result in substantial tax liability. We obtained a private letter ruling from the IRS substantially to the effect that the distribution of shares of MPC common stock in the spin-off qualified as tax free to MPC, us and our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368 and related provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). If the factual assumptions or representations made in the request for the private letter ruling prove to have been inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, then we will not be able to rely on the ruling. Furthermore, the IRS does not rule on whether a distribution such as the spin-off satisfies certain requirements necessary to obtain tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code. Rather, the private letter ruling was based on representations by us that those requirements were satisfied, and any inaccuracy in those representations could invalidate the ruling. In connection with the spin-off, we also obtained an opinion of outside counsel, substantially to the effect that, the distribution of shares of MPC common stock in the spin-off qualified as tax free to MPC, us and our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368 and related provisions of the Code. The opinion relied on, among other things, the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by MPC and us which, if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, would jeopardize the conclusions reached by such counsel in its opinion. The opinion is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the IRS or the courts would not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail. If, notwithstanding receipt of the private letter ruling and opinion of counsel, the spin-off were determined not to qualify under Section 355 of the Code, each U.S. holder of our common stock who received shares of MPC common stock in the spin-off would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of MPC common stock received. That distribution would be taxable to each such stockholder as a dividend to the extent of our accumulated earnings and profits as of the effective date of the spin-off. For each such stockholder, any amount that exceeded those earnings and profits would be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such stockholder tax basis in its shares of our common stock with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain. We would be subject to tax as if we had sold all the outstanding shares of MPC common stock in a taxable sale for their fair market value and would recognize taxable gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such shares over our tax basis in such shares. Under the terms of the Tax Sharing Agreement we entered into with MPC in connection with the spin-off, MPC is generally responsible for any taxes imposed on MPC or us and our subsidiaries in the event that the spin-off and/or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment as a result of actions taken, or breaches of representations and warranties made in the Tax Sharing Agreement, by MPC or any of its affiliates. However, if the spin-off and/or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment because of actions or failures to act by us or any of our affiliates, we would be responsible for all such taxes. We may issue preferred stock whose terms could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of Marathon Oil common stock. Our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such preferences, powers and relative, participating, optional and other rights, including preferences over Marathon Oil common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our Board of Directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of Marathon Oil common stock. For example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 2. Properties The location and general character of our principal crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas properties and facilities, and other important physical properties have been described by segment under Item 1. Business . 23 Estimated net proved crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas reserves and the basis for estimating these reserves are set forth in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Supplementary Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities . Item 3. Legal Proceedings We are a defendant in a number of legal and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, royalty claims, contract claims, tax disputes and environmental claims. While the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 25 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of such legal and administrative proceedings. Environmental Proceedings The following is a summary of certain proceedings involving us that were pending or contemplated as of December 31, 2018 , under federal and state environmental laws. Government entities have filed lawsuits in several states seeking to hold a wide variety of companies that produce fossil fuels liable for the alleged impacts of the greenhouse gas emissions attributable to those fuels. The lawsuits allege damages as a result of global warming and the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and abatement under various tort theories. Marathon Oil has been named as a defendant in several of these lawsuits, along with numerous other companies. Similar lawsuits may be filed in other jurisdictions. While the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the claims made against us are without merit and will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow. As of December 31, 2018 , we have sites across the country where remediation is being sought under environmental statutes, both federal and state, or where private parties are seeking remediation through discussions or litigation. Based on currently available information the accrued amount to address the clean-up and remediation costs connected with these sites is not material. If our assumptions relating to these costs prove to be inaccurate, future expenditures may exceed our accrued amounts. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. 24 PART II Item 5.

Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and the other financial information found elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The following discussion includes forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties. See "Disclosures Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" (immediately prior to Part I) and Item 1A. Risk Factors . Each of our two reportable operating segments are organized by geographic location and managed according to the nature of the products and services offered. United States explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas in the United States; International explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas outside of the United States and produces and markets products manufactured from natural gas, such as LNG and methanol, in E.G. Executive Overview During 2018 , we continued our outstanding operational execution and capital efficiency across our multi-basin U.S. portfolio, maintained a strong balance sheet and delivered solid financial results. Total proved reserves were 1.3 billion boe and total assets were $21.3 billion at December 31, 2018. Additionally in 2018 , we closed on the sale of our subsidiary, Marathon Oil Libya Limited and entered into agreements to complete a full country exit in Kurdistan. Our 2018 financial and operating results highlighted below reflect our ongoing commitment to our core strategy of continuous corporate returns improvement, sustainable cash flow generation at conservative oil prices and the return of capital to shareholders. Key highlights include the following: Simplifying and concentrating our portfolio Early in 2018 we closed on the sale of our Libya subsidiary for proceeds of approximately $450 million resulting in a gain of $255 million and received $750 million in remaining proceeds from the sale of our Canadian business. During 2018 we entered into agreements for the sale of our interest in the non-operated Sarsang and Atrush blocks which will complete our full country exit from Kurdistan. We expect the remaining transaction for our subsidiary Marathon Oil KDV B.V., which holds our non-operated interest in the Atrush block, to close in the first half of 2019. In July 2018 we closed on the sale of non-core, non-operated conventional assets in the U.S. segment for a pre-tax gain of $32 million, including three in the Gulf of Mexico, further concentrating and simplifying our portfolio. In Northern Delaware we acquired 1,800 net acres in New Mexico for $105 million from the Bureau of Land Management lease sale, which is synergistic with our existing footprint in the resource play. Captured approximately 260,000 net acres in the emerging Louisiana Austin Chalk play at a cost of less than $850 per acre. Strengthened balance sheet and liquidity Returned additional capital to shareholders in 2018 by acquiring 36 million of common shares at a cost of $700 million , with $800 million of repurchase authorization remaining. Reduced estimated costs of our asset retirement obligations by $338 million primarily through accelerating our U.K. abandonment timing to capture favorable market conditions and through the disposition of Gulf of Mexico assets. Cash and cash equivalents increased approximately $900 million as a result of the sale of our Libya subsidiary and the receipt of the remaining proceeds from the sale of our Canadian business. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased by 63% , compared to the same period last year, to $ 3,234 million primarily as a result of increased price realizations and net sales volumes in our U.S. resource plays. Financial and operational results Total net sales volumes for the year were 420 mboed, including 298 mboed in the U.S. Our U.S. net sales volumes increased 64 mboed and our wells to sales increased 18% compared to 2017. Added proved reserves of 186 mmboe for a reserve replacement ratio from continuing operations of 125% . Our net income per share from continuing operations was $1.30 in 2018 as compared to a net loss per share of $0.97 last year. Included in the 2018 net income are: 27 An increase in revenues of approximately 39% compared to 2017, as a result of increased price realizations of 28% and a 27% increase in net sales volumes in the United States. Our net gain on disposal of assets increased in 2018 to $ 319 million due to the sale of our Libya subsidiary for $255 million . Production expense, taxes other than income and shipping, handling and other increased 18% , 63% and 33%, during 2018 as a result of an increase in net sales volumes across our U.S. resource plays. Exploration and impairment expenses decreased by $274 million to $364 million , year over year, primarily due to non-cash impairment charges on proved and unproved properties in 2017. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail. Outlook Capital Budget On February 13, 2019 we announced our total 2019 Capital Budget of $2.6 billion , which includes approximately $2.4 billion of development capital and approximately $200 million to fund resource play leasing and exploration ("REx"). Our $2.4 billion development capital budget is 95% dedicated to the four U.S. resource plays with approximately 60% allocated to the Eagle Ford and Bakken and approximately 40% allocated to Oklahoma and the Northern Delaware. Our 2019 Capital Budget is broken down by reportable segment in the table below: (In millions) Capital Budget United States (a) $ 2,525 International and corporate other (b) 75 Total Capital Budget $ 2,600 (a) Includes approximately $200 million of spend to fund REx. (b) International and corporate other includes our International segment and other corporate items. Operations Our net sales volumes increased 11% in 2018 primarily as a result of new wells to sales across all U.S. resource plays. The following table presents a summary of our sales volumes for each of our segments. Refer to the Results of Operations section for a price-volume analysis for each of the segments. Net Sales Volumes 2018 Increase (Decrease) 2017 Increase (Decrease) 2016 United States (mboed) 298 27 % 234 5 % 223 International (mboed) (a) 122 (16 )% 145 19 % 122 Total continuing operations (mboed) 420 11 % 379 10 % 345 (a) We closed on the sale of our Libya subsidiary in the first quarter of 2018.

United States Net sales volumes in the segment were higher during the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily as a result of new wells to sales across all U.S. resource plays. The following tables provide additional details regarding net sales volumes, sales mix and operational drilling activity for our significant operations within this segment: Net Sales Volumes 2018 Increase (Decrease) 2017 Increase (Decrease) 2016 Equivalent Barrels (mboed) Eagle Ford 108 7% 101 (4)% 105 Bakken 84 50% 56 4% 54 Oklahoma 74 37% 54 54% 35 Northern Delaware 20 233% 6 100% Other United States (a) 12 (29)% 17 (41)% 29 Total United States (mboed) 298 27% 234 5% 223 (a) Year ended December 31, 2018 includes decreases of 5 mboed, relating primarily to the disposition of certain assets in the Gulf of Mexico and conventional assets in Oklahoma in July 2018 and September 2017 and Colorado in October 2017. Additionally, year ended December 31, 2017 includes decreases of 14 mboed, consisting of the disposition of Wyoming and certain non-operated CO2 and waterflood assets in West Texas and New Mexico in 2016. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for information about these dispositions. 28 Sales Mix - U.S. Resource Plays - 2018 Eagle Ford Bakken Oklahoma Northern Delaware Total Crude oil and condensate 59% 85% 25% 58% 57% Natural gas liquids 21% 8% 28% 20% 20% Natural gas 20% 7% 47% 22% 23% Drilling Activity - U.S. Resource Plays 2018 2017 2016 Gross Operated Eagle Ford: Wells drilled to total depth 123 182 168 Wells brought to sales 149 157 168 Bakken: Wells drilled to total depth 78 90 3 Wells brought to sales 80 39 13 Oklahoma: Wells drilled to total depth 55 86 33 Wells brought to sales 57 73 28 Northern Delaware: Wells drilled to total depth 69 27 Wells brought to sales 52 18 Eagle Ford Our net sales volumes were 108 mboed in 2018 , which was 7% higher compared to 2017 . We brought 149 gross company-operated wells to sales in 2018 . In Atascosa County, we brought online 40 wells during 2018 with strong well results, demonstrating the strength of the extended core. During 2018, we generated significant cash flow, improved well productivity with annual oil growth of 7%, despite 5% fewer gross company-operated wells to sales. Bakken Our net sales volumes of 84 mboed in 2018 represented a 50% increase over the prior year of 56 mboed. We brought 80 gross company-operated wells to sales in 2018 with continued impressive well results. During 2018, we delivered best-in-basin well performance, significant cash flow, capital efficient annual oil growth of 53%, and successful core extension tests in the Ajax, Southern Hector and Elk Creek areas. During the fourth quarter we conducted a successful core extension test in the Ajax area of Dunn County, as the four-well Gloria pad achieved strong results at an average completed well cost of approximately $5 million. Oklahoma Our net sales volumes in 2018 increased by 37% from 2017 , with net sales volumes of 74 mboed. We brought 57 gross company-operated wells to sales in 2018. In 2018, we successfully transitioned to infill development in the over-pressured STACK Meramec and SCOOP Woodford, delivering competitive returns and predictable results at various spacing designs. Northern Delaware Our net sales volumes were 20 mboed in 2018 while bringing 52 gross company-operated wells to sales. We continue to make significant progress in improving efficiencies and midstream access for all products to protect and enhance margins. During the fourth quarter, we executed a comprehensive water management agreement covering the entire Red Hills prospect area, complementing a previously announced agreement in Eddy County. 29 International Net sales volumes in the segment were lower during the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to the sale of our subsidiary in Libya, planned maintenance activities and natural declines in E.G. The following table provides details regarding net sales volumes for our significant operations within this segment: Net Sales Volumes 2018 Increase (Decrease) 2017 Increase (Decrease) 2016 Equivalent Barrels (mboed) Equatorial Guinea 97 (11)% 109 7% 102 United Kingdom (a) 13 (7)% 14 (18)% 17 Libya 8 (60)% 20 567% 3 Other International 4 100% 2 100% Total International 122 (16)% 145 19% 122 Equity Method Investees LNG (mtd) 5,805 (10)% 6,423 9% 5,874 Methanol (mtd) 1,241 (10)% 1,374 1% 1,358 Condensate and LPG (boed) 13,034 (10)% 14,501 8% 13,430 (a) Includes natural gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale. Equatorial Guinea Net sales volumes in 2018 were lower than 2017 as a result of timing of liftings, natural field decline and planned maintenance activities during the year. United Kingdom Net sales volumes in 2018 were slightly lower than 2017 primarily due to unscheduled downtime at the non-operated Foinaven complex in the fourth quarter 2018. Libya During the first quarter of 2018 we closed on the sale of our subsidiary in Libya. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Market Conditions Crude oil and condensate and NGLs benchmarks increased in 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 . As a result, we experienced increased price realizations associated with those benchmarks. We continue to expect crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas benchmark prices to remain volatile based on global supply and demand, which will result in increases or decreases in our price realizations during 2019. See Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition Critical Accounting Estimates for further discussion of how declines in commodity prices could impact us. Additional detail on market conditions, including our average price realizations and benchmarks for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas relative to our operating segments, follows. 30 United States The following table presents our average price realizations and the related benchmarks for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 . 2018 Increase (Decrease) 2017 Increase (Decrease) 2016 Average Price Realizations (a) Crude oil and condensate (per bbl) (b) $ 63.11 28 % $ 49.35 28 % $ 38.57 Natural gas liquids (per bbl) 24.54 19 % 20.55 56 % 13.15 Natural gas (per mcf) (c) 2.65 (7 )% 2.84 19 % 2.38 Benchmarks WTI crude oil average of daily prices (per bbl) $ 64.90 28 % $ 50.85 17 % $ 43.47 LLS crude oil average of daily prices (per bbl) 70.04 30 % 54.04 20 % 45.02 Mont Belvieu NGLs (per bbl) (d) 28.63 20 % 23.76 37 % 17.40 Henry Hub natural gas settlement date average (per mmbtu) 3.09 (1 )% 3.11 26 % 2.46 (a) Excludes gains or losses on commodity derivative instruments.

United Kingdom Crude oil and condensate Generally sold in relation to the Brent crude benchmark. Equatorial Guinea Crude oil and condensate Alba Field liquids production is primarily condensate and generally sold in relation to the Brent crude benchmark. Alba Plant LLC processes the rich hydrocarbon gas which is supplied by the Alba Field under a fixed price long term contract. Alba Plant LLC extracts NGL and secondary condensate which is then sold by Alba Plant LLC at market prices, with our share of the revenue reflected in income from equity method investments on the consolidated statements of income. Natural gas liquids Wet gas is sold to Alba Plant LLC at a fixed-price term contract resulting in realized prices not fully tracking market price. Alba Plant LLC extracts NGLs, which are sold at market price, with our share of income from Alba Plant LLC being reflected in the income from equity method investments on the consolidated statements of income. 31 Natural gas - Dry natural gas is sold to EGHoldings and AMPCO at fixed-price long term contracts resulting in realized prices not fully tracking market price. We derive additional value from the equity investment in our downstream gas processing units EG LNG and AMPCO that market LNG and methanol at market prices. Consolidated Results of Operations: 2018 compared to 2017 Revenues from contracts with customers are presented by segment in the table below: Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2018 2017 Revenues from contracts with customers United States $ 4,886 $ 3,093 International 1,016 1,154 Segment revenues from contracts with customers $ 5,902 $ 4,247 Below is a price/volume analysis for each segment.

We have multiple crude oil and natural gas derivative contracts indexed to NYMEX WTI and Henry Hub. We record commodity derivative gains/losses as the index pricing and forward curves change each period. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Marketing revenues decreased $162 million in 2018 from 2017 . This decrease is the result of adopting the new revenue standard, ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers during the first quarter of 2018. As a result of this standard, we have changed our presentation of marketing revenues and marketing expenses from the historical gross presentation to a net presentation. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Income from equity method investments decreased $31 million primarily due to higher production costs and lower volumes and pricing at our E.G. LNG production facility. Our higher production costs and lower volumes were primarily driven by planned maintenance activities during the first quarter 2018. Net gain on disposal of assets increased $261 million in 2018 from 2017 . This increase was primarily related to the 2018 sale of our Libya subsidiary for a pre-tax gain of $255 million ; and also includes the sale of non-core assets in the Gulf of Mexico and our International segment during the current year. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for information about these dispositions. Other income increased $72 million in 2018 from 2017 primarily a result of the reduction of our U.K. asset retirement obligation during 2018. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for detail about our asset retirement obligation. Production expenses increased $126 million during 2018 from 2017 primarily due to higher sales volumes across our United States segment. Our United States segment increased $149 million primarily due to higher costs as a result of increased 32 sales volumes and new wells to sales in our developing Northern Delaware asset. International segment decreased $24 million primarily due to the sale of our subsidiary in Libya in the first quarter 2018. The following table provides production expense and production expense rates for each segment: (in millions/$ per boe) 2018 2017 Production Expense and Production Expense Rate Expense Rate Expense Rate United States $ 625 $ 5.75 $ 476 $ 5.57 International $ 215 $ 4.86 $ 239 $ 4.51 Marketing costs decreased $168 million in 2018 from 2017 . This decrease is the result of adopting the new revenue standard, ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers during the first quarter of 2018. As a result of this standard, we have changed our presentation of marketing revenues and marketing expenses from the historical gross presentation to a net presentation. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Shipping, handling and other operating expenses increased $144 million in 2018 from 2017 primarily as a result of increased sales volumes in our United States segment. Exploration expenses decreased $120 million during 2018 versus the comparable 2017 . The decrease was primarily due to lower unproved property impairments and dry well costs in certain non-core international properties in 2018 versus 2017. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for details of these items. The following table summarizes the components of exploration expenses: Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2018 2017 Exploration Expenses Unproved property impairments $ 208 $ 246 Dry well costs 47 77 Geological and geophysical 21 25 Other 13 61 Total exploration expenses $ 289 $ 409 Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $69 million in 2018 from 2017 primarily as a result of an increase of $206 million in the United States segment primarily due to higher sales volumes across all U.S. resource plays. Offsetting this higher expense was a decrease of $131 million in our International segment primarily due to the reduction of our estimated U.K. asset retirement costs. Additionally, lower sales volumes in E.G., asset sales in Libya and Kurdistan all contributed to the lower expense during 2018. Our segments apply the units-of-production method to the majority of their assets, including capitalized asset retirement costs; therefore, volumes have an impact on DD&A expense. The DD&A rate (expense per boe), which is impacted by field-level changes in reserves, capitalized costs and sales volumes, can also impact our DD&A expense. Our United States DD&A rate decreased in 2018 primarily due to increased proved developed reserves in our U.S. resource plays in late 2017; as well as reduced capitalized costs relating to the Gulf of Mexico impairment charge in 2017 and the subsequent sale of these assets in 2018 . The DD&A rate for International decreased with the reduction of our estimated U.K. asset retirement costs in the second half of 2018 and 2017. The following table provides DD&A rates for each segment: ($ per boe) 2018 2017 DD&A Rate United States $ 20.39 $ 23.51 International $ 4.44 $ 6.19 Impairments decreased $154 million in 2018 from 2017 . This decrease was primarily the result of the proved property impairments in the third quarter 2017 in certain non-core international properties and certain properties in the Gulf of Mexico. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 11 to the consolidated financial statement for detail of proved property impairments each year. Taxes other than income tend to increase or decrease in relation to revenue and sales volumes, primarily in the U.S. As U.S. sales volumes and revenues increased during 2018, this resulted in an increase of $116 million compared to 2017. Additionally, the State of Oklahoma approved an increase to the gross production tax from 2% to 5% on all existing and new wells for the first thirty-six months, effective July 1, 2018. The following table summarizes the components of taxes other than 33 income: Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2018 2017 Taxes other than income Production and severance $ 208 $ 121 Ad valorem 23 13 Other 68 49 Total taxes other than income $ 299 $ 183 General and administrative expenses increased $23 million in 2018 compared to 2017 . This was primarily the result of officer and non-officer compensation, including improved performance of stock-based performance units. Net interest and other decreased $44 million during 2018 compared to 2017 . This decrease was primarily due the redemption of $1.76 billion of debt during 2017, partially offset by the termination of our forward starting interest rate swaps in 2017, which resulted in a gain of $46 million . The components of net interest and other are detailed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements. Loss on early extinguishment of debt decreased $51 million in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to make-whole call provisions paid upon redemption of $1.76 billion in senior unsecured notes in 2017 . See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail. Provision (benefit) for income taxes reflects an effective tax rate from continuing operations of 23% and 83% for 2018 and 2017 . See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the effective income tax rate. Discontinued operations are presented net of tax. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for financial information concerning our discontinued operations. Segment Results: 2018 compared to 2017 Segment Income (Loss) Segment income (loss) represents income (loss) from continuing operations excluding certain items not allocated to operating segments, net of income taxes. A portion of our corporate and operations general and administrative support costs are not allocated to the operating segments. Gains or losses on dispositions, certain impairments, unrealized gains or losses on commodity derivative instruments, pension settlement losses, or other items (as determined by the CODM) are not allocated to operating segments. The following table reconciles segment income (loss) to net income (loss): Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2018 2017 United States $ 608 $ (148 ) International 473 374 Segment income (loss) 1,081 226 Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes (a) 15 (1,056 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations 1,096 (830 ) Income (loss) from discontinued operations (b) (4,893 ) Net income (loss) $ 1,096 $ (5,723 ) (a) See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail about items not allocated to segments. (b) We sold our Canadian business in the second quarter of 2017. The Canadian business is reflected as discontinued operations in 2017 . United States segment income increased $756 million after-tax in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to higher price realizations and an increase in net sales volumes, which resulted in increased revenues. This increase in revenue was partially offset by an increase in our net loss on commodity derivatives. Additionally, our increase in net sales volumes resulted in a corresponding increase to production expenses, DD&A, taxes other than income, and shipping, handling and other operating expenses which partially offset the increase to revenues. International segment income increased $99 million after-tax in 2018 compared to 2017 as a result of increased income in Other International and the U.K. primarily as a result of increased price realizations and an increase in Other International sales volumes. Lower expenses in 2018 were primarily driven by lower DD&A expense as a result of the decrease in estimated U.K. asset retirement costs, lower E.G. sales volumes and the sale of certain Other International properties. This was partially offset by lower income in Libya due to the 2018 sale of our Libya subsidiary (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information). Consolidated Results of Operations: 2017 compared to 2016 Revenues from contracts with customers are presented by segment in the table below: Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2017 2016 Revenues from contracts with customers United States $ 3,093 $ 2,331 International 1,154 665 Segment revenues from contracts with customers $ 4,247 $ 2,996 Below is a price/volume analysis for each segment. Refer to the preceding Operations and Market Conditions sections for additional detail related to our net sales volumes and average price realizations.

Net gain (loss) on commodity derivatives decreased $30 million in 2017 from 2016. We have multiple crude oil and natural gas derivative contracts indexed to NYMEX WTI and Henry Hub. We record commodity derivative gains/losses as the index pricing and forward curves change each period. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Marketing revenues decreased $78 million in 2017 from 2016 , primarily as a result of lower marketed volumes in the United States segment due to non-core asset dispositions. Marketing activities include the purchase of commodities from third parties for resale and serve to aggregate volumes in order to satisfy transportation commitments as well as to achieve flexibility within product types and delivery points. Since the volume of marketing activity is based on market dynamics, it can fluctuate from period to period. Income from equity method investments increased $81 million primarily due to higher price realizations from LPG at our Alba plant and methanol at our AMPCO methanol facility. Also contributing to the increase was improvement in net sales volumes primarily driven by the completion of the Alba field compression project in E.G. during the second half of 2016. Net gain on disposal of assets decreased $331 million in 2017 from 2016 . This decrease was primarily related to the sale of non-core assets in the first half of 2016 in Wyoming, West Texas and New Mexico, and the Gulf of Mexico. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for information about these dispositions. Other income increased $25 million in 2017 from 2016. This increase was primarily a result of a downward revision in U.K. estimated asset retirement costs as well as timing of abandonment activities in the U.K. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for detail about our asset retirement obligation. 34 Production expenses remained nearly flat during 2017 while our sales volumes from continuing operations increased. During 2017, our production expense rate (expense per boe) for United States was lower primarily due to the disposition of higher cost non-core assets in Wyoming. The International expense rate decreased in the year of 2017 primarily due to an increase in sales volumes in E.G. and Libya, combined with lower maintenance costs in E.G. ($ per boe) 2017 2016 Production Expense Rate Expense Rate Expense Rate United States $ 476 $ 5.57 $ 486 $ 5.96 International $ 239 $ 4.51 $ 234 $ 5.26 Marketing costs decreased $77 million in 2017 from the prior year, consistent with the decrease in marketing revenues discussed above. Shipping, handling, and other operating expenses decreased $53 million compared to 2016 which included the termination payment of our Gulf of Mexico deepwater drilling commitment in 2016. Exploration expenses increased $86 million in 2017 versus the comparable 2016 period, due primarily to charges taken as a result of lower forecasted long-term commodity prices and the anticipated sales of certain non-core properties in our International segment. In 2017, we recorded non-cash charges of $159 million comprised of $95 million in unproved property impairments in our International segment and $64 million dry well costs related to our Diaba License G4-223 in the Republic of Gabon. Additionally, our decision not to develop the Tchicuate offshore Block in the Republic of Gabon resulted in an increase to exploration expenses of $43 million during 2017. Unproved property impairments during 2016 primarily consist of non-cash charges related to our decision to not drill our remaining Gulf of Mexico leases. The following table summarizes the components of exploration expenses: Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2017 2016 Exploration Expenses Unproved property impairments $ 246 $ 195 Dry well costs 77 25 Geological and geophysical 25 5 Other 61 98 Total exploration expenses $ 409 $ 323 Exploration expense are also discussed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $216 million in 2017 from the prior year primarily as a result of an increase of $176 million in the United States due to a 5% increase in net sales volumes, and an increase in the DD&A rates within our U.S. resource plays. Also contributing to this higher expense was an increase of $52 million in our International segment resulting from increased sales volumes due to the completion and start-up of our E.G. Alba field compression project in mid-2016, and the resumption of sales volumes and production in Libya. Our segments apply the units-of-production method to the majority of their assets, including capitalized asset retirement costs; therefore, volumes have an impact on DD&A expense. The DD&A rate (expense per boe), which is impacted by field-level changes in sales volumes, reserves and capitalized costs, can also cause changes to our DD&A. The DD&A rate for United States increased primarily due to the sales volume mix between our U.S. resource plays, and the outside-operated Gunflint field achieving first production in mid-2016. Also contributing to the increase was a reduction to the Eagle Ford proved developed reserve base in the fourth quarter of 2016. The DD&A rate for our International segment remained relatively consistent with the 2016 rate. The following table provides DD&A rates for each segment. ($ per boe) 2017 2016 DD&A Rate United States $ 23.51 $ 22.49 International $ 6.19 $ 6.21 35 Impairments increased $162 million in 2017 from the comparable 2016 period. This increase was primarily consisting of $136 million of proved property impairments in certain non-core properties in our International segment as a result of our anticipated sales and lower forecasted long-term commodity prices. Additionally, included in proved property impairments was $89 million in 2017 and $67 million in 2016 , both relating to lower forecasted commodity prices in conventional properties in Oklahoma and the Gulf of Mexico. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 11 to the consolidated financial statement for additional detail. Taxes other than income includes production, severance and ad valorem taxes, primarily in the U.S., which tend to increase or decrease in relation to revenue and sales volumes. Taxes other than income increased $32 million in the current year as a result of increased revenue and sales volumes, and due to a reserve being established for non-income tax examinations relating to open tax years. The following table summarizes the components of taxes other than income: Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2017 2016 Taxes other than income Production and severance $ 121 $ 91 Ad valorem 13 23 Other 49 37 Total taxes other than income $ 183 $ 151 Net interest and other decreased $62 million during 2017 primarily as a result of the termination of our forward starting interest rate swaps, which resulted in a gain of $46 million . Additionally, during 2017 we reduced total long-term debt by approximately $1.75 billion which resulted in a reduction to our net interest and other. The components of net interest and other are detailed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. Loss on early extinguishment of debt increased $51 million in 2017 primarily due to make-whole call provisions of $46 million paid upon the redemption of $1.76 billion in senior unsecured notes. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail. Other net periodic benefit costs decreased $ 83 million primarily due to reduced pension settlement charges of $32 million in 2017 compared to $103 million in 2016 . Provision (benefit) for income taxes reflects an effective tax rate from continuing operations of 83% and 79% for 2017 and 2016 . In 2017, our tax expense was primarily a result of our full valuation allowance on our net federal deferred tax assets throughout 2017 and the effects of our foreign operations. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the effective income tax rate. Discontinued operations are presented net of tax. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for financial information concerning our discontinued operations. 36 Segment Results: 2017 compared to 2016 Segment Income (Loss) Segment income (loss) represents income (loss) from continuing operations excluding certain items not allocated to operating segments, net of income taxes. A portion of our corporate and operations general and administrative support costs are not allocated to the operating segments. Gains or losses on dispositions, certain impairments, unrealized gains or losses on commodity derivative instruments, pension settlement losses, or other items (as determined by the CODM) are not allocated to operating segments. The following table reconciles segment income (loss) to net income (loss): Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2017 2016 United States $ (148 ) $ (415 ) International 374 228 Segment income (loss) 226 (187 ) Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes (a) (1,056 ) (1,900 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations (830 ) (2,087 ) Income (loss) from discontinued operations (b) (4,893 ) (53 ) Net income (loss) $ (5,723 ) $ (2,140 ) (a) See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail about items not allocated to segments. (b) We sold our Canadian business in the second quarter of 2017. The Canadian business is reflected as discontinued operations in all periods presented. United States segment loss decreased $267 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to higher price realizations and higher sales volumes. Partially offsetting this revenue increase was an increase in DD&A and a decrease in the income tax benefit, as we did not realize a tax benefit on any net federal deferred tax assets generated in 2017 due to the full valuation allowance on net federal deferred tax assets in the prior year. International segment income increased $146 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to higher price realizations, and an increase in sales volumes in E.G. and Libya. This was partially offset by an increase in DD&A and income tax expense as a result of the increase in sales volumes. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, Cash Flows and Liquidity Commodity prices are the most significant factor impacting our operating cash flows and the amount of capital available to reinvest into the business. In 2018, we experienced an increase in operating cash flows primarily due to improvements in the commodity price environment with increased consolidated average crude oil and condensate price realizations of over 25% to $63.32 , and an increase to net sales volumes of 11% to 420 mboed. During 2018 we continued our cash flow growth with highlights that include: Cash and cash equivalents increased approximately $900 million to $1.5 billion at December 31, 2018 . Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased by 63% , compared to the same period last year, to $ 3,234 million . Used this additional cash provided by operating activities to return capital to shareholders by executing $700 million of share repurchases. Received $750 million in remaining proceeds from the sale of our Canadian business and $450 million in proceeds from the sale of our Libya subsidiary. Additionally these divestiture proceeds were used to capture additional acreage in our resource play leasing and exploration program of $369 million . At December 31, 2018 , we had approximately $4.9 billion of liquidity consisting of $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $3.4 billion available under our revolving credit facility. Additionally, during 2018 we extended the maturity date of our Credit Facility from May 28, 2021, to May 28, 2022. As previously discussed in our Outlook section, we are targeting a $2.6 billion Capital Budget for 2019 . We believe our current liquidity level, cash flow from operations and ability to access the capital markets provides us with the flexibility to fund our business throughout the different commodity price cycles. We will continue to evaluate the commodity price environment and our spending throughout 2019 . 37 Cash Flows The following table presents sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents from continuing operations for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 : Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2018 2017 2016 Sources of cash and cash equivalents Operating activities - continuing operations $ 3,234 $ 1,988 $ 901 Disposal of assets, net of cash transferred to the buyer 1,264 1,787 1,219 Common stock issuance 1,236 Borrowings 988 Other 93 68 56 Total sources of cash and cash equivalents $ 4,591 $ 4,831 $ 3,412 Uses of cash and cash equivalents Additions to property, plant and equipment $ (2,753 ) $ (1,974 ) $ (1,204 ) Additions to other assets (26 ) (25 ) Acquisitions, net of cash acquired (25 ) (1,891 ) (902 ) Purchases of common stock (713 ) (11 ) (6 ) Debt repayments (2,764 ) (1 ) Debt extinguishment costs (46 ) Dividends paid (169 ) (170 ) (162 ) Other (6 ) (5 ) (6 ) Total uses of cash and cash equivalents $ (3,692 ) $ (6,886 ) $ (2,281 ) Cash flows generated from operating activities in 2018 were 63% higher as both commodity price realizations and net sales volumes improved compared to 2017 . Consolidated average crude oil and condensate price realizations increased by over 25% and net sales volumes increased 11% during 2018 as compared to 2017 . Proceeds from the disposals of assets for 2018 are primarily related to our non-operated interest in Libya as well as the remaining proceeds from the sale of our Canadian business. Proceeds from the disposals of assets for 2017 is primarily the result of the disposal of our Canadian business, and in 2016 are primarily from the sale of our Wyoming upstream and midstream assets, as well as the sale of certain other non-operated CO2 and waterflood assets in West Texas and New Mexico. Disposition transactions are discussed in further detail in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. Issuance of common stock reflects net proceeds received in 2016 from our public sale of common stock. Borrowings in 2017 are a result of the issuance of $1 billion of 4.4% senior unsecured notes due in 2027. Financing transactions are discussed in further detail in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Additions to property, plant and equipment reflect a significant use of cash and cash equivalents. The following table shows capital expenditures related to continuing operations by segment and reconciles to additions to property, plant and equipment as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows: Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2018 2017 2016 United States (a) $ 2,620 $ 2,081 $ 936 International 39 42 82 Corporate 26 27 18 Total capital expenditures 2,685 2,150 1,036 Change in capital expenditure accrual 68 (176 ) 168 Total use of cash and cash equivalents for property, plant and equipment $ 2,753 $ 1,974 $ 1,204 (a) 2018 capital expenditures includes 1,800 net acres in New Mexico for $105 million acquired from the Bureau of Land Management lease sale. 38 Additions to other assets relates to deposits on our resource play leasing and exploration program. During 2018 our resource play leasing and exploration capital expenditures totaled $369 million , largely including costs within property, plant and equipment, other assets and acquisitions. These expenditures were more than fully funded through the divestiture proceeds received in 2018. During 2017, we closed on multiple Permian basin acquisitions for approximately $1.9 billion with cash on hand. Additionally, during 2016, we closed the Oklahoma STACK acquisition for a purchase price of $904 million , net of cash acquired. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information concerning acquisitions. In 2018, we acquired 36 million common shares at a cost of $700 million , excluding transaction fees and commissions, under our share repurchase program. Shares purchased were held as treasury stock. See Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. In December 2017, we redeemed $1 billion of 5.125% municipal revenue bonds due in 2037 in a refunding transaction. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2017, we used the net proceeds of the borrowing disclosed above plus existing cash on hand to redeem $1.76 billion in senior unsecured notes resulting in a recognized loss on early extinguishment of debt of $46 million , primarily due to make-whole call provisions. Financing transactions are discussed in further detail in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. During 2018 , 2017 and 2016, the Board of Directors approved a $0.05 per share quarterly dividend. See Capital Requirements below for additional information about the fourth quarter 2018 dividend. Liquidity and Capital Resources In October 2018, we extended the maturity date of our Credit Facility from May 28, 2021, to May 28, 2022. Fees on the unused commitment to the lenders, as well as the borrowing options under the Credit Facility, remain unaffected by the term extension. We retain the ability to request two one-year extensions and an option to increase the commitment amount by up to an additional $107 million , subject to the consent of any increasing lenders. The sub-facilities for swing-line loans and letters of credit remain unchanged allowing up to an aggregate amount of $100 million and $500 million, respectively. Our main sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, internally generated cash flow from operations, sales of non-core assets, capital market transactions, and our revolving Credit Facility. At December 31, 2018 , we had approximately $4.9 billion of liquidity consisting of $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $3.4 billion available under our revolving Credit Facility. Our working capital requirements are supported by these sources and we may draw on our revolving Credit Facility to meet short-term cash requirements, or issue debt or equity securities through the shelf registration statement discussed below as part of our longer-term liquidity and capital management program. Because of the alternatives available to us as discussed above, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity are adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements including our capital spending budgets, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities, and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies. General economic conditions, commodity prices, and financial, business and other factors could affect our operations and our ability to access the capital markets. Our corporate credit ratings as of December 31, 2018 are: Standard & Poor's Ratings Services BBB- (positive); Fitch Ratings BBB (stable); and Moody's Investor Services, Inc. Ba1 (positive). A downgrade in our credit ratings could increase our future cost of financing or limit our ability to access capital, and result in additional collateral requirements. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of how a further downgrade in our credit ratings could affect us. Additionally, in December of 2017, we redeemed $1 billion of 5.125% municipal revenue bonds due in 2037 in a refunding transaction that preserved our ability to remarket up to $1 billion of tax-exempt municipal bonds prior to 2037. We may incur additional debt in order to fund our capital expenditures, acquisitions or development activities, or for general corporate or other purposes. A higher level of indebtedness could increase the risk that our liquidity and financial flexibility deteriorates. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a further discussion of how our level of indebtedness could affect us. Capital Resources Credit Arrangements and Borrowings At December 31, 2018 , we had no borrowings against our revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2018 , we had $5.5 billion in long-term debt outstanding, with our next debt maturity in the amount of $600 million due in 2020. We do not have any triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an event of default in the case of a downgrade of our credit ratings. 39 Shelf Registration We have a universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC under which we, as a "well-known seasoned issuer" for purposes of SEC rules, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities. Asset Disposals We entered into an agreement to sell our subsidiary, Marathon Oil KDV B.V., which holds our 15% non-operated interest in the Atrush block in Kurdistan for proceeds of $63 million , before closing adjustments. Disposition transactions are discussed in further detail in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. Debt-To-Capital Ratio The Credit Facility includes a covenant requiring that our ratio of total debt to total capitalization not exceed 65% as of the last day of each fiscal quarter.

The remaining share repurchase authorization as of December 31, 2018 is $800 million . Other Expected Cash Outflows On January 30, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.05 per share for the fourth quarter of 2018 . The dividend is payable on March 11, 2019 to shareholders of record on February 20, 2019. We plan to make contributions of up to $50 million to our funded pension plans during 2019 . Cash contributions to be paid from our general assets for the unfunded pension and postretirement plans are expected to be approximately $5 million and $18 million in 2019 . 40 Contractual Cash Obligations The table below provides aggregated information on our consolidated obligations to make future payments under existing contracts as of December 31, 2018 .

(b) Oil and gas activities include contracts to acquire property, plant and equipment and commitments for oil and gas exploration such as costs related to contractually obligated exploratory work programs that are expensed immediately. (c) Service and materials contracts include contracts to purchase services such as utilities, supplies and various other maintenance and operating services. (d) Includes any drilling rigs and fracturing crews that are not considered lease obligations. (e) Primarily includes obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits including medical and life insurance. We have estimated projected funding requirements through 2027. Although unrecognized tax benefits are not a contractual obligation, they are presented in this table because they represent potential demands on our liquidity. (f) This table does not include the estimated discounted liability for dismantlement, abandonment and restoration costs of oil and gas properties of $1,145 million . See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. Transactions with Related Parties We own a 63% working interest in the Alba field offshore E.G. Onshore E.G., we own a 52% interest in an LPG processing plant, a 60% interest in an LNG production facility and a 45% interest in a methanol production plant, each through equity method investees. We sell our natural gas from the Alba field to these equity method investees as the feedstock for their production processes. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Off-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Although off-balance sheet arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes, we are not dependent on these arrangements to maintain our liquidity and capital resources, and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the off-balance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources. We will issue stand-alone letters of credit when required by a business partner. Such letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 aggregated $52 million , $89 million and $166 million . Most of the letters of credit are in support of obligations recorded in the consolidated balance sheet. For example, they are issued to counterparties to support firm transportation agreements and future abandonment liabilities. In 2018, we signed an agreement with a lessor to construct and lease a new build-to-suit office building in Houston, Texas. The new Houston office location is expected to be completed in 2021. The lessor and other participants are providing financing for up to $380 million, to fund the estimated project costs. As of December 31, 2018 project costs incurred totaled $45 million, primarily for land acquisition costs. The five-year lease term will commence once construction is substantially complete and the new Houston office is able to be occupied. At the end of the initial lease term, we can extend the term of the lease for an additional five years, subject to the approval of the participants; purchase the property subject to certain terms and conditions; remarket the property to an unrelated third party. As of December 31, 2018 we have recorded this agreement as an operating lease, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on operating leases. 41 Management Discussion and Analysis of Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies We have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes. We accrue for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated. As environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise, charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required. New or expanded environmental requirements, which could increase our environmental costs, may arise in the future. We strive to comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment, but as not all costs are fixed or presently determinable (even under existing legislation) and may be affected by future legislation or regulations, it is not possible to predict all of the ultimate costs of compliance, including remediation costs that may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed. For more information on environmental regulations that impact us, or could impact us, see Item 1. Business Environmental, Health and Safety Matters , Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 3. Legal Proceedings . Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods. Accounting estimates are considered to be critical if (1) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and (2) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. Estimated Quantities of Net Reserves We use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities. The successful efforts method inherently relies on the estimation of proved crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas reserves. The amount of estimated proved reserve volumes affect, among other things, whether certain costs are capitalized or expensed, the amount and timing of costs depreciated, depleted or amortized into net income and the presentation of supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities. In addition, the expected future cash flows to be generated by producing properties are used for testing impairment and the expected future taxable income available to realize deferred tax assets, also in part, rely on estimates of quantities of net reserves. Refer to the applicable sections below for further discussion of these accounting estimates. The estimation of quantities of net reserves is a highly technical process performed by our engineers and geoscientists for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, which is based upon several underlying assumptions. The reserve estimates may change as additional information becomes available and as contractual, operational, economic and political conditions change. We evaluate our reserves using drilling results, reservoir performance, seismic interpretation and future plans to develop acreage. Technologies used in proved reserves estimation includes statistical analysis of production performance, decline curve analysis, pressure and rate transient analysis, pressure gradient analysis, reservoir simulation and volumetric analysis. The observed statistical nature of production performance coupled with highly certain reservoir continuity or quality within the reliable technology areas and sufficient proved developed locations establish the reasonable certainty criteria required for booking proved reserves. The data for a given reservoir may also change over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. 42 Reserve estimates are based on an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices during the 12-month period, using the closing prices on the first day of each month, as defined by the SEC. The table below provides the 2018 SEC pricing for certain benchmark prices: 2018 SEC Pricing WTI Crude oil (per bbl) $ 65.56 Henry Hub natural gas (per mmbtu) $ 3.05 Brent crude oil (per bbl) $ 72.70 Mont Belvieu NGLs (per bbl) $ 26.63 When determining the December 31, 2018 proved reserves for each property, the benchmark prices listed above were adjusted using price differentials that account for property-specific quality and location differences. Estimates of future cash flows associated with proved reserves are based on actual costs of developing and producing proved reserves at the end of the year. If annual SEC crude oil benchmark prices (see table above) were to decrease to approximately $45 per bbl, or 30% below average prices used to estimate 2018 proved reserves, we would not expect price related reserve revisions to have a material impact on proved reserve volumes. For further discussion of risks associated with our estimation of proved reserves, see Part I. Item 1A Risk Factors . Depreciation and depletion of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas producing properties is determined by the units-of-production method and could change with revisions to estimated proved reserves. While revisions of previous reserve estimates have not historically been significant to the depreciation and depletion rates of our segments, any reduction in proved reserves, could result in an acceleration of future DD&A expense. The following table illustrates, on average, the sensitivity of each segment's units-of-production DD&A per boe and pretax income to a hypothetical 10% change in 2018 proved reserves based on 2018 production. Impact of a 10% Increase in Proved Reserves Impact of a 10% Decrease in Proved Reserves (In millions, except per boe) DD&A per boe Pretax Income DD&A per boe Pretax Income United States $ (1.85 ) $ 202 $ 2.27 $ (246 ) International $ (0.40 ) $ 18 $ 0.49 $ (22 ) Asset Retirement Obligations We have material legal, regulatory and contractual obligations to remove and dismantle long-lived assets and to restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations. A liability equal to the fair value of such obligations and a corresponding capitalized asset retirement cost are recognized on the balance sheet in the period in which the legal obligation is incurred and a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The capitalized asset retirement cost is depreciated using the units-of-production method or the straight line method (dependent on the underlying asset) and the discounted liability is accreted over the period until the obligation is satisfied, the impacts of which are recognized as DD&A in the consolidated statements of income. In many cases, the satisfaction and subsequent discharge of these liabilities is projected to occur many years, or even decades, into the future. Furthermore, the legal, regulatory and contractual requirements often do not provide specific guidance regarding removal practices and the criteria that must be fulfilled when the removal and/or restoration event actually occurs. Estimates of retirement costs are developed for each property based on numerous factors, such as the scope of the dismantlement, timing of settlement, interpretation of legal, regulatory and contractual requirements, type of production and processing structures, depth of water (if applicable), reservoir characteristics, depth of the reservoir, market demand for equipment, currently available dismantlement and restoration procedures and consultations with construction and engineering professionals. Currency exchange rates, inflation rates and credit-adjusted-risk-free interest rates are then applied to estimate the fair values of the obligations. To the extent these or other assumptions change after initial recognition of the liability, the fair value estimate is revised and the recognized liability adjusted, with a corresponding adjustment made to the related asset balance or income statement, as appropriate. Changes in estimated asset retirement obligations for late life assets could result in impairment or in the recognition of income. During 2018 we made revisions to these estimates and reduced our recognized liability by $204 million . This downward revision was primarily due to the acceleration of our U.K. abandonment activities to capture favorable market conditions and lower estimated abandonment costs. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures regarding our asset retirement obligation estimates. 43 An estimate of the sensitivity to net income if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practical because of the number of obligations that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of possible assumptions. Fair Value Estimates Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. There are three approaches for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities: the market approach, the income approach and the cost approach, each of which includes multiple valuation techniques. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach uses valuation techniques to measure fair value by converting future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, into a single present value, or range of present values, using current market expectations about those future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace the service capacity of an asset. This is often referred to as current replacement cost. The cost approach assumes that the fair value would not exceed what it would cost a market participant to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility, adjusted for obsolescence. The fair value accounting standards do not prescribe which valuation technique should be used when measuring fair value and do not prioritize among the techniques. These standards establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in applying the various valuation techniques. Inputs broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make pricing decisions, including assumptions about risk. Level 1 inputs are given the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy while Level 3 inputs are given the lowest priority. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: Level 1 Observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets as of the measurement date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 2 Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. These are inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date. Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data and may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management best estimate of fair value. Valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs are favored. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest priority level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities within the levels of the fair value hierarchy. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures regarding our fair value measurements. Significant uses of fair value measurements include: impairment assessments of long-lived assets; impairment assessments of goodwill; and recorded value of derivative instruments. The need to test long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment can be based on several indicators, including a significant reduction in prices of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, sustained declines in our common stock, reductions to our Capital Budget, unfavorable adjustments to reserves, significant changes in the expected timing of production, other changes to contracts or changes in the regulatory environment in which the property is located. Impairment Assessments of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets in use are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. For purposes of an impairment evaluation, long-lived assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified, which generally is field-by-field or, in certain instances, by logical grouping of assets if there is significant shared infrastructure or contractual terms that cause economic interdependency amongst separate, discrete fields. If the sum of the undiscounted estimated cash flows from the use of the asset group and its eventual disposition is less than the carrying value of an asset group, the carrying value is written down to the estimated fair value. During 2018 the anticipated sales of certain non-core proved properties in our International and United States segments triggered an assessment of certain of our long-lived assets related to oil and gas producing properties for impairment. We estimated the fair values using a market approach, based upon anticipated sales proceeds less costs to sell, and recognized impairments. As of December 31, 2018 our estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to our remaining long-lived assets significantly exceeded their carrying values in our core assets. Long-lived assets most at risk for future impairment had 44 an estimated carrying value of less than $50 million. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 11 and Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of impairments recorded in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 and the related fair value measurements. Fair value calculated for the purpose of testing our long-lived assets for impairment is estimated using the present value of expected future cash flows method and comparative market prices when appropriate. Significant judgment is involved in performing these fair value estimates since the results are based on forecasted assumptions. Significant assumptions include: Future crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas prices. Our estimates of future prices are based on our analysis of market supply and demand and consideration of market price indicators. Although these commodity prices may experience extreme volatility in any given year, we believe long-term industry prices are driven by global market supply and demand. To estimate supply, we consider numerous factors, including the worldwide resource base, depletion rates and OPEC production policies. We believe demand is largely driven by global economic factors, such as population and income growth, governmental policies and vehicle stocks. The prices we use in our fair value estimates are consistent with those used in our planning and capital investment reviews. There has been significant volatility in crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas prices and estimates of such future prices are inherently imprecise. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion on commodity prices. Estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas. Such quantities are based on a combination of proved reserves and risk-weighted probable reserves and resources such that the combined volumes represent the most likely expectation of recovery. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion on reserves. Expected timing of production. Production forecasts are the outcome of engineering studies which estimate reserves, as well as expected capital programs. The actual timing of the production could be different than the projection. Cash flows realized later in the projection period are less valuable than those realized earlier due to the time value of money. The expected timing of production that we use in our fair value estimates is consistent with that used in our planning and capital investment reviews. Discount rate commensurate with the risks involved. We apply a discount rate to our expected cash flows based on a variety of factors, including market and economic conditions, operational risk, regulatory risk and political risk. A higher discount rate decreases the net present value of cash flows. Future capital requirements. Our estimates of future capital requirements are based upon a combination of authorized spending and internal forecasts. We base our fair value estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonably likely to occur. An estimate of the sensitivity to changes in assumptions in our undiscounted cash flow calculations is not practicable, given the numerous assumptions (e.g. reserves, pace and timing of development plans, commodity prices, capital expenditures, operating costs, drilling and development costs, inflation and discount rates) that can materially affect our estimates. Unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions would likely be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions. For example, the impact of sustained reduced commodity prices on future undiscounted cash flows would likely be partially offset by lower costs. Impairment Assessments of Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or between annual tests when events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value may have been reduced below its carrying value. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. Our reporting units are the same as our reporting segments, of which only International includes goodwill. As of December 31, 2018 , our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of $ 97 million . Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions. We first assess the qualitative factors in order to determine whether the fair value of our International reporting unit is more likely than not less than its carrying amount. Certain qualitative factors used in our evaluation include, among other things, the results of the most recent quantitative assessment of the goodwill impairment test, macroeconomic conditions; industry and market conditions (including commodity prices and cost factors); overall financial performance; and other relevant entity-specific events. If, after considering these events and circumstances we determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the International reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative goodwill test is performed. The quantitative goodwill test is performed using a combination of market and income approaches. The market approach references observable inputs specific to us and our industry, such as the price of our common equity, our enterprise value, and valuation multiples of us and our peers from the investor analyst community. The income approach utilizes discounted cash flows, which are based on forecasted assumptions. Key assumptions to the income approach are the same as those described above regarding our impairment assessment of long lived assets and are consistent with those that management uses to make business decisions. 45 During the second quarter of 2018, we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill using the qualitative assessment. Our qualitative assessment considered the significant excess fair value over carrying value in our most recent step 1 test (second quarter 2017) and noted a general improvement in the qualitative factors above. After assessing the totality of the qualitative factors which could have a positive or negative impact on goodwill, our assessment did not indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value. As a result, we concluded that no impairment to goodwill was required for our International reporting unit. We believe the estimates and assumptions used in our impairment assessments are reasonable and based on available market information, but variations in such assumptions could result in materially different calculations of fair value and determinations of whether or not an impairment is indicated. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of goodwill. Derivatives We record all derivative instruments at fair value. Fair value measurements for all our derivative instruments are based on observable market-based inputs that are corroborated by market data and are discussed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. Additional information about derivatives and their valuation may be found in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk . Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in numerous taxing jurisdictions worldwide. Estimates of income taxes to be recorded involve interpretation of complex tax laws and assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our U.S. federal income taxes. Uncertainty exists regarding tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns which remain subject to examination, along with positions expected to be taken in future returns. We provide for unrecognized tax benefits, based on the technical merits, when it is more likely than not that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained upon examination. Adjustments are made to the uncertain tax positions when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit; court proceedings; changes in applicable tax laws, including tax case rulings and legislative guidance; or expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. We have recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured at enacted tax rates, for temporary differences between book basis and tax basis, tax credit carryforwards and operating loss carryforwards. In accordance with U.S. GAAP accounting standards, we routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets, to the expected realizable amount, by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In assessing the need for additional or adjustments to existing valuation allowances, we consider all available positive and negative evidence. Positive evidence includes reversals of temporary differences, forecasts of future taxable income, assessment of future business assumptions and applicable tax planning strategies that are prudent and feasible. Negative evidence includes losses in recent years as well as the forecasts of future income (loss) in the realizable period. In making our assessment regarding valuation allowances, we weight the evidence based on objectivity. We base our future taxable income estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonably likely to occur. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the estimation of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions and the assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our U.S. federal income taxes. Future operating conditions can be affected by numerous factors, including (i) future crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas prices, (ii) estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, (iii) expected timing of production, and (iv) future capital requirements. These assumptions are described in further detail above regarding our impairment assessment of long-lived assets. An estimate of the sensitivity to changes in assumptions resulting in future taxable income calculations is not practicable, given the numerous assumptions that can materially affect our estimates. Unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions would likely be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions. For example, the impact of sustained reduced commodity prices on future taxable income would likely be partially offset by lower capital expenditures. Based on the assumptions and judgments described above, as of December 31, 2018 , we reflect a valuation allowance in our consolidated balance sheet of $749 million against our gross deferred tax assets of $ 2.0 billion in various jurisdictions in which we operate. Our gross deferred tax assets consist primarily of federal U.S. operating loss carryforwards of $655 million , which will expire in 2035 - 2037, and $472 million in 2018 which can be carried forward indefinitely. Since December 31, 2016, we have maintained a full valuation allowance on our net federal deferred tax assets. If objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses are no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as forecasted projections of taxable income in future years, we would adjust the amount of the federal deferred tax assets considered realizable and reduce the provision for income taxes in the period of adjustment. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail. 46 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations Accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the following: the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; the expected long-term return on plan assets; the rate of future increases in compensation levels; and We develop our demographics and utilize the work of third-party actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations. We have selected different discount rates for our U.S. pension plans and our other U.S. postretirement benefit plans due to the different projected benefit payment patterns. In determining the assumed discount rates, our methods include a review of market yields on high-quality corporate debt and use of our third-party actuary's discount rate model. This model calculates an equivalent single discount rate for the projected benefit plan cash flows using a yield curve derived from bond yields. The yield curve represents a series of annualized individual spot discount rates from 0.5 to 99 years. The bonds used are rated AA or higher by a recognized rating agency, only non-callable bonds are included and outlier bonds (bonds that have a yield to maturity that significantly deviates from the average yield within each maturity grouping) are removed. Each issue is required to have at least $300 million par value outstanding. The constructed yield curve is based on those bonds representing the 50% highest yielding issuances within each defined maturity group. Of the assumptions used to measure obligations and estimated annual net periodic benefit cost as of December 31, 2018 the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit cost reported for the plans. The hypothetical impacts of a 0.25% change in the discount rates of 4.26% for our U.S. pension plans and 4.09% for our other U.S. postretirement benefit plans is summarized in the table below: Impact of a 0.25% Increase in Discount Rate Impact of a 0.25% Decrease in Discount Rate (In millions) Obligation Expense Obligation Expense U.S. pension plans $ (3 ) $ $ 3 $ Other U.S. postretirement benefit plans $ (1 ) $ $ 1 $ The asset rate of return assumption for the funded U.S. plan considers the plan's asset mix (currently targeted at approximately 55% equity and 45% other fixed income securities), past performance and other factors. Certain components of the asset mix are modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation, debt returns and stock yields. Decreasing the 6.50% asset rate of return assumption by 0.25% would not have a significant impact on our defined benefit pension expense. Compensation change assumptions are based on historical experience, anticipated future management actions and demographics of the benefit plans. Health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements includes detailed information about the assumptions used to calculate the components of our annual defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan expense, as well as the obligations and accumulated other comprehensive income reported on the consolidated balance sheets. Contingent Liabilities We accrue contingent liabilities for environmental remediation, tax deficiencies related to operating taxes, as well as tax disputes and litigation claims when such contingencies are probable and estimable. Actual costs can differ from estimates for many reasons. For instance, settlement costs for claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on responsibility and assessments of the amount of damages. Similarly, liabilities for environmental remediation may vary from estimates because of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation, additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination and improvements in technology. Our in-house legal counsel regularly assesses these contingent liabilities. In certain circumstances outside legal counsel is utilized. We generally record losses related to these types of contingencies as other operating expense or general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income, except for tax contingencies unrelated to income taxes, which are recorded as taxes other than income. For additional information on contingent liabilities, see Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Management Discussion and Analysis of Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies . 47 An estimate of the sensitivity to net income if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practical because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, in terms of both the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss. Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. 48 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and condensate, NGLs, and natural gas prices as the volatility of these prices continues to impact our industry. We expect commodity prices to remain volatile and unpredictable in the future, we are also exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates. We employ various strategies, including the use of financial derivative instruments, to manage the risks related to commodity price fluctuations. We are at risk for changes in the fair value of all of our derivative instruments; however, such risk should be mitigated by price changes related to the underlying commodity or financial transaction. While the use of derivative instruments could materially affect our results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods, we believe that the use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 14 and Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about the fair value measurement of our derivatives, the amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income and the related notional amounts. Commodity Price Risk Our strategy is to obtain competitive prices for our products and allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand. However, management will periodically protect prices on forecasted sales to support cash flow and liquidity, as deemed appropriate. We may use a variety of commodity derivative instruments, including futures, forwards, swaps and combinations of options, as part of an overall program to manage commodity price risk in our business. Our consolidated results for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 were impacted by crude oil and natural gas derivatives related to a portion of our forecasted United States sales. As of December 31, 2018 , we had various open commodity derivatives related to crude oil and natural gas with a net asset position of $127 million .

Our sensitivity to interest rate movements and corresponding changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt portfolio affects our results of operations and cash flows only when we elect to repurchase or otherwise retire fixed-rate debt at prices different than carrying value. Counterparty Risk We are also exposed to financial risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties. If commodity prices fall below current levels, some of our counterparties may experience liquidity problems and may not be able to meet their financial obligations to us. We review the creditworthiness of counterparties and use master netting agreements when appropriate. 49
