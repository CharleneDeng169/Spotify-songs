In comparison, we reported net income of $6.0 billion ($11.82 per diluted common share) on total net revenue of $28.1 billion for 2018 , and $2.0 billion ($3.49 per diluted common share) on total net revenue of $27.2 billion for 2017. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio as calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach was 12.2% and 11.2% as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. See MD&A Capital Management below for additional information. On June 27, 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.2 billion of shares of our common stock ( 2019 Stock Repurchase Program ) beginning in the third quarter of 2019 through the end of the second quarter of 2020. Through the end of 2019, we repurchased approximately $1.4 billion of shares of our common stock under the 2019 Stock Repurchase Program. See MD&A Capital Management Dividend Policy and Stock Purchases for additional information. On July 29, 2019, we announced the Cybersecurity Incident. For more information, see Part I Item 1. Business Overview Cybersecurity Incident and Note 18 Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others . Below are additional highlights of our performance in 2019 . These highlights are generally based on a comparison between the results of 2019 and 2018 , except as otherwise noted. The changes in our financial condition and credit performance are generally based on our financial condition and credit performance as of December 31, 2019 compared to our financial condition and credit performance as of December 31, 2018 . We provide a more detailed discussion of our financial performance in the sections following this Executive Summary and Business Outlook . 40 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Discussions of our performance in 2017 and comparisons between 2018 and 2017 can be found in Part II Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A ) of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. Total Company Performance Earnings: Our net income decreased by $469 million to $5.5 billion in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily driven by: higher non-interest expense due to continued investments in technology and infrastructure, expenses related to the Walmart partnership, and increased marketing expense; higher provision for credit losses largely due to credit deterioration in our commercial energy loan portfolio and an allowance release in our auto loan portfolio in 2018 ; and the net impact of the absence of significant activities that occurred in 2018, including gains from the sales of our exited businesses, a benefit related to a tax methodology change on rewards costs, an impairment charge as a result of repositioning our investment securities portfolio, and a legal reserve build. These drivers were partially offset by: higher net interest income due to higher yields on interest-earnings assets and gr owth in our loan portfolio, including the acquired Walmart portfolio, partially offset by higher interest expense from higher rates paid and growth in our deposit products ; and an increase in net interchange fees driven by higher purchase volume. Loans Held for Investment : Period-end loans held for investment increased by $19.9 billion to $265.8 billion as of December 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 primarily driven by growth in our domestic credit card loan portfolio, including the acquired Walmart portfolio, as well as growth in our commercial and auto loan portfolios . Average loans held for investment increased by $5.3 billion to $247.5 billion in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily driven by growth in our commercial, domestic credit card including the acquired Walmart portfolio, and auto loan portfolios, partially offset by the impact of lower loan balances from the sale of our consumer home loan portfolio. Net Charge-Off and Delinquency Metrics: Our net charge-off rate remained substantially flat at 2.53% in 2019 as the impact of lower loan balances from the sale of our consumer home loan portfolio was largely offset by growth in our domestic credit card loan portfolios, including the acquired Walmart portfolio. Our 30+ day delinquency rate decreased by 10 basis points to 3.74% as of December 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 primarily driven by the strong economy and stable underlying credit performance in our domestic credit card loan portfolio, partially offset by the impact of the acquired Walmart portfolio. Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses: Our allowance for loan and lease losses remained substantially flat at $7.2 billion as of December 31, 2019 as an allowance release in our domestic credit card loan portfolio largely due to the strong economy and stable underlying credit performance was offset by an allowance build due to credit deterioration in our commercial energy loan portfolio . Our allowance coverage ratio decreased by 23 basis points to 2.71% as of December 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 primarily driven by the strong economy and stable underlying credit performance in our domestic credit card loan portfolio and the impacts from partner loss sharing arrangements, offset by higher reserves in our commercial banking business . 41 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Business Outlook We discuss below our expectations as of the time this Report was filed regarding our total company performance and the performance of our business segments based on market conditions, the regulatory environment and our business strategies. The statements contained in this section are based on our current expectations regarding our outlook for our financial results and business strategies. Our expectations take into account, and should be read in conjunction with, our expectations regarding economic trends and analysis of our business as discussed in Part I Item 1. Business and Part II Item 7. MD&A in this Report. Certain statements are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results could differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements. Except as otherwise disclosed, forward-looking statements do not reflect: any change in current dividend or repurchase strategies; the effect of any acquisitions, divestitures or similar transactions that have not been previously disclosed; any changes in laws, regulations or regulatory interpretations, in each case after the date as of which such statements are made; or the potential impact on our business, operations and reputation from, and expenses and uncertainties associated with, the Cybersecurity Incident, other than the incremental costs related to the incident we expect to incur in 2020 which will be separately reported as an adjusting item as it relates to the Company financial results. See Part I Item 1. Business Forward-Looking Statements in this Report for more information on the forward-looking statements included in this Report and Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Report for factors that could materially influence our results. Total Company Expectations Marketing and Efficiency: We expect to achieve modest improvements in full-year operating efficiency ratio, net of adjustments, in 2020, with a bigger move down to 42% in 2021. We expect the operating efficiency ratio improvement to drive significant improvement in our total efficiency ratio by 2021. We expect marketing expense for full-year 2020 to be moderately higher than marketing expense for full-year 2019. Capital/Current Expected Credit Loss ( CECL ): We estimate that the adoption of the CECL model will increase our reserves for credit losses by approximately $2.9 billion and expect that the phased-in impact of adopting CECL will reduce our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio by 16 basis points in the first quarter of 2020. See MD&A Accounting Changes and Developments in this Report for additional information related to the CECL adoption impact. We expect the recently finalized Tailoring Rules will provide a tailwind to our capital reduction under stress and that we believe there is an opportunity for capital relief under the Stress Capital Buffer Proposed Rule. We expect when we opt-out of the requirement to include in regulatory capital certain elements of Accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) under the Tailoring Rules, our common equity Tier 1 ratio will decrease about 30 basis points. Business Segment Expectations Consumer Banking: We continue to expect that the annual auto net charge-off rate will increase gradually as the cycle plays out. 42 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The section below provides a comparative discussion of our consolidated financial performance for 2019 and 2018 . We provide a discussion of our business segment results in the following section, MD&A Business Segment Financial Performance . You should read this section together with our MD&A Executive Summary and Business Outlook , where we discuss trends and other factors that we expect will affect our future results of operations. Net Interest Income Net interest income represents the difference between the interest income, including certain fees, earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense incurred on our interest-bearing liabilities. Interest-earning assets include loans, investment securities and other interest-earning assets, while our interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing deposits, securitized debt obligations, senior and subordinated notes, other borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. Generally, we include in interest income any past due fees on loans that we deem collectible. Our net interest margin, based on our consolidated results, represents the difference between the yield on our interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities, including the notional impact of non-interest-bearing funding. We expect net interest income and our net interest margin to fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 43 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 1 below presents the average outstanding balance, interest income earned, interest expense incurred and average yield for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 for each major category of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Nonperforming loans are included in the average loan balances below.

(2) Some of our commercial loans generate tax-exempt income. Accordingly, we present our Commercial Banking interest income and yields on a taxable- equivalent basis, calculated using the federal statutory rate (21% for 2019 and 2018 and 35% for 2017) and state taxes where applicable, with offsetting reductions to the Other category. Taxable-equivalent adjustments included in the interest income and yield computations for our commercial loans totaled approximately $82 million for 2019 and 2018 and $129 million in 2017 , with corresponding reductions to the Other category. (3) Interest income/expense of Other represents the impact of hedge accounting of our loan portfolios and the offsetting reduction of the taxable-equivalent adjustments of our commercial loans as described above. ** Not meaningful. 44 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Net interest income increased by $465 million to $23.3 billion in 2019 compared to 2018 , primarily driven by higher yields on interest-earnings assets and gr owth in our loan portfolio, including the acquired Walmart portfolio, partially offset by higher interest expense from higher rates paid and growth in our deposit products . Net interest margin decreased by 4 basis points to 6.83% in 2019 compared to 2018 as higher rates on our retail deposits were largely offset by higher yields on interest-earning assets and growth in our loan portfolio. Table 2 displays the change in our net interest income between periods and the extent to which the variance is attributable to: changes in the volume of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities; or changes in the interest rates related to these assets and liabilities. Table 2 : Rate/Volume Analysis of Net Interest Income (1) 2019 vs. 2018 2018 vs. 2017 (Dollars in millions) Total Variance Volume Rate Total Variance Volume Rate Interest income: Loans: Credit card $ 740 $ 687 $ 53 $ 1,213 $ 977 $ 236 Consumer banking 178 (334 ) 512 (80 ) (647 ) 567 Commercial banking (2) 273 240 33 403 3 400 Other (3) (57 ) 50 (107 ) (196 ) (46 ) (150 ) Total loans, including loans held for sale 1,134 643 491 1,340 287 1,053 Investment securities 200 64 136 500 273 227 Cash equivalents and other interest-earning assets 3 28 (25 ) 114 69 45 Total interest income 1,337 735 602 1,954 629 1,325 Interest expense: Interest-bearing deposits 822 120 702 996 61 935 Securitized debt obligations 27 (26 ) 53 169 14 155 Senior and subordinated notes 34 (17 ) 51 394 98 296 Other borrowings and liabilities (11 ) (14 ) 3 (20 ) (56 ) 36 Total interest expense 872 63 809 1,539 117 1,422 Net interest income $ 465 $ 672 $ (207 ) $ 415 $ 512 $ (97 ) __________ (1) We calculate the change in interest income and interest expense separately for each item. The portion of interest income or interest expense attributable to both volume and rate is allocated proportionately when the calculation results in a positive value. When the portion of interest income or interest expense attributable to both volume and rate results in a negative value, the total amount is allocated to volume or rate, depending on which amount is positive. (2) Some of our commercial loans generate tax-exempt income. Accordingly, we present our Commercial Banking interest income and yields on a taxable- equivalent basis, calculated using the federal statutory rate (21% for 2019 and 2018 and 35% for 2017) and state taxes where applicable, with offsetting reductions to the Other category. (3) Interest income/expense of Other represents the impact of hedge accounting of our loan portfolios and the offsetting reduction of the taxable-equivalent adjustments of our commercial loans as described above. 45 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Non-Interest Income Table 3 displays the components of non-interest income for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . Table 3 : Non-Interest Income Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 2017 Interchange fees, net $ 3,179 $ 2,823 $ 2,573 Service charges and other customer-related fees 1,330 1,585 1,597 Net securities gains (losses) 26 (209 ) 65 Other non-interest income: (1) Mortgage banking revenue 165 661 201 Treasury and other investment income 193 49 126 Other 360 292 215 Total other non-interest income 718 1,002 542 Total non-interest income $ 5,253 $ 5,201 $ 4,777 ________ (1) Includes gains of $61 million and losses of $15 million on deferred compensation plan investments in 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Non-interest income remained relatively flat at $5.3 billion in 2019 as the increase in net interchange fees, driven by higher purchase volume, was largely offset by: the absence of the significant activities that occurred in 2018, including the gains from the sales of our exited businesses and the impairment charge as a result of repositioning our investment securities portfolio; and lower service charges and other customer-related fees. Provision for Credit Losses Our provision for credit losses in each period is driven by net charge-offs, changes to the allowance for loan and lease losses, and changes to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. We recorded a provision for credit losses of $6.2 billion , $5.9 billion and $7.6 billion in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The provision for credit losses as a percentage of net interest income was 26.7% , 25.6% and 33.6% in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Our p rovision for credit losses increased by $380 million to $6.2 billion in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily driven by credit deterioration in our commercial energy loan portfolio and an allowance release in our auto loan portfolio in 2018 . We provide additional information on the provision for credit losses and changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses within MD&A Credit Risk Profile , and Note 4 Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments . For information on the allowance methodology for each of our loan categories, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . 46 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Non-Interest Expense Table 4 displays the components of non-interest expense for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . Table 4 : Non-Interest Expense Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 2017 Salaries and associate benefits (1) $ 6,388 $ 5,727 $ 5,899 Occupancy and equipment 2,098 2,118 1,939 Marketing 2,274 2,174 1,670 Professional services 1,237 1,145 1,097 Communications and data processing 1,290 1,260 1,177 Amortization of intangibles 112 174 245 Other non-interest expense: Bankcard, regulatory and other fee assessments 362 490 626 Collections 400 413 364 Fraud losses 383 364 334 Other (2) 939 1,037 843 Total other non-interest expense 2,084 2,304 2,167 Total non-interest expense $ 15,483 $ 14,902 $ 14,194 _________ (1) Includes expenses of $61 million and benefits of $15 million related to our deferred compensation plan in 2019 and 2018 , respectively. These amounts have corresponding offsets in other non-interest income. (2) Includes $38 million of net Cybersecurity Incident expenses in 2019, consisting of $72 million of expenses and $34 million of insurance recoveries. Non-interest expense increased by $581 million to $15.5 billion in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to continued investments in technology and infrastructure, expenses related to the Walmart partnership, and increased marketing expenses, partially offset by the absence of a legal reserve build. Income Taxes We recorded income tax provisions of $1.3 billion ( 19.5% effective income tax rate), $1.3 billion (17.7% effective income tax rate) and $3.4 billion (61.5% effective income tax rate) in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations varies between periods due, in part, to the impact of the changes in tax credits, tax-exempt income, and non-deductible expenses relative to our pre-tax earnings. We recorded discrete tax benefits of $19 million in 2019, discrete tax benefits of $318 million in 2018 primarily driven by a benefit of $284 million related to a tax methodology change on rewards costs and discrete tax expenses of $1.7 billion in 2017 primarily consisting of the charges of $1.8 billion for the estimated impacts of the Tax Act. The increase in our effective tax rate in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in recorded discrete tax benefit, partially offset by higher tax credits and lower non-deductible expenses relative to our income. We provide additional information on items affecting our income taxes and effective tax rate in Note 15 Income Taxes . 47 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS ANALYSIS Total assets increased by $17.8 billion to $390.4 billion as of December 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 primarily driven by growth in our domestic credit card loan portfolio, including the acquired Walmart portfolio, as well as growth in our commercial and auto loan portfolios . Total liabilities increased by $11.5 billion to $332.4 billion as of December 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 primarily driven by deposit growth, partially offset by maturities of our short-term Federal Home Loan Banks ( FHLB ) advances. Stockholders equity increased by $6.3 billion to $58.0 billion as of December 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 primarily due to our net income of $5.5 billion , changes in accumulated other comprehensive income of $2.4 billion and the net issuance of preferred stock, partially offset by repurchases of common stock under the 2019 Stock Repurchase Program and dividend payments to our stockholders. The following is a discussion of material changes in the major components of our assets and liabilities during 2019 . Period-end balance sheet amounts may vary from average balance sheet amounts due to liquidity and balance sheet management activities that are intended to support the adequacy of capital while managing our liquidity requirements, our customers and our market risk exposure in accordance with our risk appetite. Investment Securities Our investment securities portfolio consists primarily of the following: U.S. Treasury securities; U.S. government-sponsored enterprise or agency ( Agency ) and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities ( RMBS ); Agency commercial mortgage-backed securities ( CMBS ); and other securities. Agency securities include Government National Mortgage Association ( Ginnie Mae ) guaranteed securities, Federal National Mortgage Association ( Fannie Mae ) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( Freddie Mac ) issued securities. The U.S. Treasury and Agency securities generally have high credit ratings and low credit risks, and our investments in U.S. Treasury and Agency securities represented 96% of our total investment securities portfolio, as of both December 31, 2019 and 2018 . On December 31, 2019, we transferred our entire portfolio of held to maturity securities to available for sale in consideration of changes to regulatory capital requirements under the Tailoring Rules. As a Category III institution, we are no longer required to include in regulatory capital certain elements of AOCI, including unrealized gains and losses from available for sale securities. The impact of this transfer and changes in interest rates increased the fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio by $33.1 billion to $79.2 billion as of December 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 . See MD&A Capital Management and Note 2 Investment Securities for more information.

We provide additional information on the composition of our loan portfolio and credit quality below in MD&A Credit Risk Profile , MD&A Consolidated Results of Operations and Note 3 Loans . Funding Sources Our primary source of funding comes from deposits, as they are a stable and relatively low cost source of funding. In addition to deposits, we also raise funding through the issuance of securitized debt obligations and other debt. Other debt primarily consists of senior and subordinated notes, FHLB advances secured by certain portions of our loan and securities portfolios, and federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. Table 7 provides the composition of our primary sources of funding as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 . Table 7 : Funding Sources Composition December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 (Dollars in millions) Amount % of Total Amount % of Total Deposits: Consumer Banking $ 213,099 67 % $ 198,607 64 % Commercial Banking 32,134 10 29,480 10 Other (1) 17,464 5 21,677 7 Total deposits 262,697 82 249,764 81 Securitized debt obligations 17,808 6 18,307 6 Other debt 37,889 12 40,598 13 Total funding sources $ 318,394 100 % $ 308,669 100 % __________ (1) Includes brokered deposits of $16.7 billion and $21.2 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Total deposits increased by $12.9 billion to $262.7 billion as of December 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 primarily driven by strong growth as a result of our national banking strategy in our Consumer Banking business. Securitized debt obligations decreased by $499 million to $17.8 billion as of December 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 primarily driven by net maturities in our credit card securitizations, partially offset by issuances in our auto securitizations. Other debt decreased by $2.7 billion to $37.9 billion as of December 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 primarily driven by maturities of our short-term FHLB advances. We provide additional information on our funding sources in MD&A Liquidity Risk Profile and Note 8 Deposits and Borrowings . 49 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent decreases or increases in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of future reversals of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management judgment that these future deductions are more likely than not to be realized. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of expected taxable income from all sources, including taxable income in carryback years, reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates. We use our historical experience and our short and long-range business forecasts to provide insight. Deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities and valuation allowances, were approximately $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2019 , a decrease of $425 million from December 31, 2018 . The decrease in our net deferred tax assets was primarily driven by the increase in the fair value of our investment securities portfolio. We recorded valuation allowances of $223 million and $245 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. We expect to fully realize the 2019 net deferred tax assets in future periods. If changes in circumstances lead us to change our judgment about our ability to realize deferred tax assets in future years, we will adjust our valuation allowances in the period that our change in judgment occurs and record a corresponding increase or charge to income. We provide additional information on income taxes in MD&A Consolidated Results of Operations and Note 15 Income Taxes . OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS In the ordinary course of business, we engage in certain activities that are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets, generally referred to as off-balance sheet arrangements. These activities typically involve transactions with unconsolidated variable interest entities ( VIEs ) as well as other arrangements, such as letters of credit, loan commitments and guarantees, to meet the financing needs of our customers and support their ongoing operations. We provide additional information regarding these types of activities in Note 5 Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations and Note 18 Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others . BUSINESS SEGMENT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE Our principal operations are organized for management reporting purposes into three major business segments, which are defined primarily based on the products and services provided or the types of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio, asset/liability management by our centralized Corporate Treasury group and residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate that is not assessed to our primary business segments, are included in the Other category. The results of our individual businesses, which we report on a continuing operations basis, reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources. We may periodically change our business segments or reclassify business segment results based on modifications to our management reporting methodologies and changes in organizational alignment. Our business segment results are intended to reflect each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. We use an internal management and reporting process to derive our business segment results. Our internal management and reporting process employs various allocation methodologies, including funds transfer pricing, to assign certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses directly or indirectly attributable to each business segment. Total interest income and non-interest income are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported. The net interest income of each segment reflects the results of our funds transfer pricing process, which is primarily based on a matched funding concept that takes into consideration market interest rates. Our funds transfer pricing process provides a funds credit for sources of funds, such as deposits generated by our Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking businesses, and a charge for the use of funds by each segment. The allocation process is unique to each business segment and acquired businesses. We regularly assess the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, which may result in the implementation of refinements or changes in future periods. We refer to the business segment results derived from our internal management accounting and reporting process as our managed presentation, which differs in some cases from our reported results prepared based on U.S. GAAP. There is no comprehensive 50 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to U.S. GAAP; therefore, the managed presentation of our business segment results may not be comparable to similar information provided by other financial services companies. In addition, our individual business segment results should not be used as a substitute for comparable results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We summarize our business segment results for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 and provide a comparative discussion of the results of 2019 and 2018 , as well as changes in our financial condition and credit performance metrics as of December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018 . We provide a reconciliation of our total business segment results to our reported consolidated results in Note 17 Business Segments and Revenue from Contracts with Customers . Business Segment Financial Performance Table 8 summarizes our business segment results, which we report based on revenue and income from continuing operations, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 . We provide information on the allocation methodologies used to derive our business segment results in Note 17 Business Segments and Revenue from Contracts with Customers .

(2) Net income (loss) for our business segments and the Other category is based on income from continuing operations, net of tax. (3) Some of our commercial investments generate tax-exempt income, tax credits or other tax benefits. Accordingly, we present our Commercial Banking revenue and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated using the federal statutory tax rate (21% for 2019 and 2018 and 35% for 2017) and state taxes where applicable, with offsetting reductions to the Other category. (4) In the first quarter of 2019, we made a change in how revenue is measured in our Commercial Banking business by revising the allocation of tax benefits on certain tax-advantaged investments. As such, prior period results have been recast to conform with the current period presentation. The result of this measurement change reduced the previously reported total net revenue in our Commercial Banking business by $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 , with an offsetting increase in the Other category. 51 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Credit Card Business The primary sources of revenue for our Credit Card business are net interest income, net interchange income and fees collected from customers. Expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating costs and marketing expenses. Our Credit Card business generated net income from continuing operations of $3.1 billion , $3.2 billion and $1.9 billion in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively.

The estimated uncollectible amount of billed finance charges and fees is reflected as a reduction in revenue and is not included in our provision for credit losses. Total net revenue was reduced by $1.4 billion , $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively, for the estimated uncollectible amount of billed finance charges and fees, and related losses. The finance charge and fee reserve totaled $462 million and $468 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. (2) Period-end loans held for investment and average loans held for investment include billed finance charges and fees, net of the estimated uncollectible amount. (3) Average yield on loans held for investment is calculated by dividing interest income for the period by average loans held for investment during the period. Interest income excludes various allocations including funds transfer pricing that assigns certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses attributable to each business segment. (4) Total net revenue margin is calculated by dividing total net revenue for the period by average loans held for investment during the period. Interest income also includes interest income on loans held for sale. (5) Within our credit card loan portfolio, only certain loans in our international card businesses are classified as nonperforming. See MD&A Nonperforming Loans and Other Nonperforming Assets for additional information. 52 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Key factors affecting the results of our Credit Card business for 2019 compared to 2018 , and changes in financial condition and credit performance between December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 include the following: Net Interest Income: Net interest income increased by $294 million to $14.5 billion in 2019 primarily driven by growth in our domestic credit card loan portfolio, including the acquired Walmart portfolio. Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income increased by $368 million to $3.9 billion in 2019 primarily due to an increase in net interchange fees driven by higher purchase volume. Provision for Credit Losses: The provision for credit losses remained substantially flat at $5.0 billion in 2019 as the allowance releases due to the strong economy and stable underlying credit performance and the sale of certain partnership receivables were largely offset by the allowance build related to the acquired Walmart portfolio. Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense increased by $729 million to $9.3 billion in 2019 primarily driven by continued investments in technology and infrastructure as well as expenses related to the Walmart partnership. Loans Held for Investment: Period-end loans held for investment increased by $11.9 billion to $128.2 billion as of December 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 and average loans held for investment increased by $4.4 billion to $114.2 billion in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to growth in our domestic credit card loan portfolio, including the acquired Walmart portfolio. Net Charge-Off and Delinquency Metrics: The net charge-off rate decreased by 11 basis points to 4.51% in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily driven by the impacts of the acquired Walmart portfolio, the strong economy and stable underlying credit performance in our domestic credit card loan portfolio. The 30+ day delinquency rate decreased by 10 basis points to 3.91% as of December 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 primarily due to the strong economy and stable underlying credit performance in our domestic credit card loan portfolio, partially offset by the impacts of the acquired Walmart portfolio. 53 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Domestic Card Business The Domestic Card business generated net income from continuing operations of $3.0 billion in both 2019 and 2018 and $1.7 billion in 2017 . In 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , the Domestic Card business accounted for greater than 90% of total net revenue of our Credit Card business.

The estimated uncollectible amount of billed finance charges and fees is reflected as a reduction in revenue and is not included in our net charge-offs. (2) Period-end loans held for investment and average loans held for investment include billed finance charges and fees, net of the estimated uncollectible amount. (3) Average yield on loans held for investment is calculated by dividing interest income for the period by average loans held for investment during the period. Interest income excludes various allocations including funds transfer pricing that assigns certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses attributable to each business segment. (4) Total net revenue margin is calculated by dividing total net revenue for the period by average loans held for investment during the period. Because our Domestic Card business accounts for the substantial majority of our Credit Card business, the key factors driving the results are similar to the key factors affecting our total Credit Card business. Net income for our Domestic Card business increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily driven by: an increase in net interchange fees due to higher purchase volume; and higher net interest income due to growth in our loan portfolio, including the acquired Walmart portfolio. These drivers were partially offset by continued investments in technology and infrastructure and expenses related to the Walmart partnership. 54 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Consumer Banking Business The primary sources of revenue for our Consumer Banking business are net interest income from loans and deposits, net interchange income and service charges and customer-related fees. Expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating costs and marketing expenses. Our Consumer Banking business generated net income from continuing operations of $1.8 billion in both 2019 and 2018 and $1.1 billion in 2017 .

Key factors affecting the results of our Consumer Banking business for 2019 compared to 2018 , and changes in financial condition and credit performance between December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 include the following: Net Interest Income: Net interest income increased by $183 million to $6.7 billion in 2019 primarily driven by higher yields and growth in our auto loan portfolio as well as higher deposit volumes in our Retail Banking business, partially offset by the reduction in net interest income from the sale of our consumer home loan portfolio. Consumer Banking loan yields increased by 83 basis points to 8.37% in 2019 compared to 2018 . The increase was primarily driven by changes in product mix due to the sale of our consumer home loan portfolio as well as originated yield improvements in our auto loan portfolio. Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income remained substantially flat at $643 million in 2019 . Provision for Credit Losses: The provision for credit losses increased by $100 million to $938 million in 2019 primarily driven by the allowance release in 2018 largely due to improvements in credit trends in our auto loan portfolio. Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense increased by $64 million to $4.1 billion in 2019 primarily driven by higher operating expenses due to growth in our auto loan portfolio and increased marketing expense associated with our national banking strategy, partially offset by lower operating expense due to the sale of our consumer home loan portfolio. Loans Held for Investment: Period-end loans held for investment increased by $3.9 billion to $63.1 billion as of December 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 due to growth in our auto loan portfolio. Average loans held for investment decreased by $4.2 billion to $60.7 billion in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to the sale of our consumer home loan portfolio, partially offset by growth in our auto loan portfolio. Deposits: Period-end deposits increased by $14.5 billion to $213.1 billion as of December 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 driven by strong growth as a result of our national banking strategy. Net Charge-Off and Delinquency Metrics: The net charge-off rate increased by 5 basis points to 1.56% in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily driven by lower loan balances due to the sale of our consumer home loan portfolio, partially offset by lower net charge-offs and growth in our auto loan portfolio. The 30+ day delinquency rate remained substantially flat at 7.34% as of December 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 as the impact of growth in our auto loan portfolio was largely offset by higher auto delinquency inventories. Commercial Banking Business The primary sources of revenue for our Commercial Banking business are net interest income from loans and deposits and non-interest income from customer fees and other products and services. Because our Commercial Banking business has loans and investments that generate tax-exempt income, tax credits or other tax benefits, we present the revenues on a taxable-equivalent basis.

Our reserve for unfunded lending commitments totaled $130 million , $118 million and $117 million as of December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. (4) Average yield on loans held for investment is calculated by dividing interest income for the period by average loans held for investment during the period. Interest income excludes various allocations including funds transfer pricing that assigns certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses attributable to each business segment.

The total nonperforming asset rate is calculated based on total nonperforming assets divided by the combined period-end total loans held for investment and other foreclosed assets. ** Not meaningful. Key factors affecting the results of our Commercial Banking business for 2019 compared to 2018 , and changes in financial condition and credit performance between December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 include the following: Net Interest Income: Net interest income decreased by $61 million to $2.0 billion in 2019 primarily driven by lower margin on loans and deposits, partially offset by growth across our commercial loan portfolios. Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income increased by $87 million to $831 million in 2019 primarily driven by higher revenue from our capital markets, treasury management products, and agency businesses. Provision for Credit Losses: Provision for credit losses increased by $223 million to $306 million in 2019 primarily driven by credit deterioration in our commercial energy loan portfolio. Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense increased by $45 million to $1.7 billion in 2019 primarily driven by higher operating expenses associated with continued investments in technology and other business initiatives. Loans Held for Investment: Period-end loans held for investment increased by $4.2 billion to $74.5 billion as of December 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 , and average loans held for investment increased by $5.2 billion to $72.5 billion in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily driven by growth across our commercial loan portfolios. Deposits: Period-end deposits increased by $2.7 billion to $32.1 billion as of December 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 primarily driven by new business growth. Net Charge-Off and Nonperforming Metrics: The net charge-off rate increased by 14 basis points to 0.22% in 2019 primarily driven by charge-offs in our commercial energy loan portfolio. The nonperforming loan rate increased by 16 basis points to 0.60% as of December 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 primarily driven by downgrades in our commercial energy loan portfolio. Other Category Other includes unallocated amounts related to our centralized Corporate Treasury group activities, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio, asset/liability management and certain capital management activities. Other also includes: unallocated corporate revenue and expenses that do not directly support the operations of the business segments or for which the business segments are not considered financially accountable in evaluating their performance, such as certain restructuring charges; offsets related to certain line-item reclassifications; residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate that is not assessed to our primary business segments ; and foreign exchange-rate fluctuations on foreign currency-denominated balances. 58 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 12 summarizes the financial results of our Other category for the periods indicated.

Net loss from continuing operations recorded in the Other category was $14 million in 2019 compared to net income of $228 million in 2018 , primarily driven by the net impact of the absence of significant activities that occurred in 2018, including gains from the sales of our exited businesses, a benefit related to a tax methodology change on rewards costs, an impairment charge as a result of repositioning our investment securities portfolio, and a legal reserve build. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make a number of judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses on the consolidated financial statements. Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We provide a summary of our significant accounting policies under Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . We have identified the following accounting estimates as critical because they require significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Our critical accounting policies and estimates are as follows: Loan loss reserves Asset impairment Fair value of financial instruments Customer rewards reserve We evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and update them as necessary, based on changing conditions. Management has discussed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 59 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Loan Loss Reserves We maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses that represents management estimate of incurred loan and lease losses inherent in our credit card, consumer banking and commercial banking loans held for investment as of each balance sheet date. We also separately reserve for contractually binding unfunded lending commitments. We build our allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments through the provision for credit losses, which is driven by charge-offs, changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses and changes in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The allowance for loan and lease losses was $7.2 billion as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. We have an established process, using analytical tools and management judgment, to determine our allowance for loan and lease losses. Establishing the allowance each quarter involves evaluating many factors including, but not limited to, historical loss and recovery experience, recent trends in delinquencies and charge-offs, risk ratings, the impact of bankruptcy filings, the value of collateral underlying secured loans, account seasoning, changes in our credit evaluation, underwriting and collection management policies, seasonality, credit bureau scores, general economic conditions, changes in the legal and regulatory environment and uncertainties in forecasting and modeling techniques used in estimating our allowance for loan and lease losses. Key factors that have a significant impact on our allowance for loan and lease losses include assumptions about employment levels, home prices and the valuation of commercial properties, automobiles and other collateral. We have a governance framework intended to ensure that our estimate of the allowance for loan and lease losses is appropriate. Our governance framework provides for oversight of methods, models, qualitative adjustments, process controls and results. At least quarterly, representatives from the Finance and Risk Management organizations review and assess our allowance methodologies, key assumptions and the appropriateness of the allowance for loan and lease losses. Groups independent of our estimation functions participate in the review and validation process. Tasks performed by these groups include periodic review of the rationale for and quantification of judgmental inputs and adjustments to results. We have a model policy, established by an independent Model Risk Office, which governs the validation of models and related supporting documentation to ensure the appropriate use of models for estimating credit losses. The Model Risk Office validates all models and requires ongoing monitoring of their performance. In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we review and assess our estimate of probable losses related to contractually binding unfunded lending commitments on a quarterly basis. The factors impacting our assessment generally align with those considered in our evaluation of the allowance for loan and lease losses for the Commercial Banking business. Changes to the reserve for losses on unfunded lending commitments are recorded through the provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of income and to other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Although we examine a variety of externally available data, as well as our internal loan performance data, to determine our allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments, our estimation process is subject to risks and uncertainties, including a reliance on historical loss and trend information that may not be representative of current conditions and indicative of future performance. Accordingly, our actual credit loss experience may not be in line with our expectations. We provide additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used in determining our allowance for loan and lease losses for each of our loan portfolio segments in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . We provide information on the components of our allowance, disaggregated by impairment methodology, and changes in our allowance in Note 4 Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments . Finance Charge and Fee Reserves Finance charges and fees on credit card loans are recorded in revenue when earned. Billed finance charges and fees on credit card loans are included in loans held for investment net of amounts that we consider uncollectible. Unbilled finance charges and fees on credit card loans are included in interest receivable. We continue to accrue finance charges and fees on credit card loans until the account is charged-off. When we do not expect full payment of billed finance charges and fees, we reduce the balance of our credit card loan receivables and revenue by the amount of finance charges and fees billed but not expected to be collected. Total net revenue was reduced by $1.4 billion , $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively, for the estimated uncollectible amount of billed finance charges and fees. The finance charge and fee reserve totaled $462 million and $468 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. 60 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents We review and assess the adequacy of the uncollectible finance charge and fee reserve on a quarterly basis. Our methodology for estimating the uncollectible portion of billed finance charges and fees is consistent with the methodology we use to estimate the allowance for incurred losses on the principal portion of our credit card loan receivables. Asset Impairment In addition to our loan portfolio, we review other assets for impairment on a regular basis in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. This process requires significant management judgment and involves various estimates and assumptions. Below we describe our process for assessing impairment of goodwill and the key estimates and assumptions involved in this process. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred in a business combination, plus the fair value of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Goodwill totaled $14.7 billion and $14.5 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. We did not recognize any goodwill impairment in 2019 and 2018 . See Note 6 Goodwill and Intangible Assets for additional information. We perform our goodwill impairment test annually on October 1 at a reporting unit level. We also are required to test goodwill for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate it is more-likely-than-not that an impairment may have occurred. We have four reporting units: Credit Card, Auto, Other Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The goodwill impairment test is a two-step process. The first step involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount, management must estimate the fair value of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit balance sheet based on applicable accounting guidance in order to measure the impairment. For the purpose of our goodwill impairment testing, we calculate the carrying amount of a reporting unit using an allocated capital approach based on each reporting unit specific regulatory capital requirements, economic capital requirements, and underlying risks. The carrying amount for a reporting unit is the sum of its respective capital requirements, goodwill and intangibles balances. We then compare the carrying amount to our total consolidated stockholders equity to assess the reasonableness of our methodology. The total carrying amount of our four reporting units was $50.5 billion , as compared to consolidated stockholder equity of $58.2 billion as of October 1, 2019. The $7.7 billion excess in consolidated stockholder equity was primarily attributable to capital allocated to our Other category and other future capital needs such as dividends, share buybacks or other strategic initiatives. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is a subjective process that requires the use of estimates and the exercise of significant judgment. We calculated the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow ( DCF ) calculation, a form of the income approach. This income approach calculation used projected cash flows based on each reporting unit internal forecast and the perpetuity growth method to calculate terminal values. Our DCF analysis required management to make estimates about future loan, deposit and revenue growth, as well as credit losses and capital rates. These cash flows and terminal values were then discounted using discount rates based on our external cost of capital with adjustments for the risk inherent in each reporting unit. The reasonableness of the DCF approach was assessed by reference to a market-based approach using comparable market multiples and recent market transactions where available. The results of the 2019 annual impairment test for the Credit Card, Auto, Other Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking reporting units indicated that the estimated fair values of these four reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying amounts. Assumptions used in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit are judgmental and inherently uncertain. A significant change in the economic conditions of a reporting unit, such as declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in capital requirements, deterioration of market conditions, adverse impacts of regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated cost of capital, could cause the estimated fair values of our reporting units to decline in the future, and increase the risk of a goodwill impairment in a future period. Fair Value Fair value, also referred to as an exit price, is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The fair value accounting guidance provides a 61 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents three-level fair value hierarchy for classifying financial instruments. This hierarchy is based on the markets in which the assets or liabilities trade and whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable. The fair value measurement of a financial asset or liability is assigned a level based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: Level 1: Valuation is based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Valuation is based on observable market-based inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3: Valuation is generated from techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. Valuation techniques include pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques. The degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted prices in active markets or observable market parameters. When quoted prices and observable data in active markets are not fully available, management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. Changes in market conditions, such as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities, may reduce the availability and reliability of quoted prices or observable data used to determine fair value. We have developed policies and procedures to determine when markets for our financial assets and liabilities are inactive if the level and volume of activity has declined significantly relative to normal conditions. If markets are determined to be inactive, it may be appropriate to adjust price quotes received. When significant adjustments are required to price quotes or inputs, it may be appropriate to utilize an estimate based primarily on unobservable inputs. Significant judgment may be required to determine whether certain financial instruments measured at fair value are classified as Level 2 or Level 3. In making this determination, we consider all available information that market participants use to measure the fair value of the financial instrument, including observable market data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs used. Based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category, judgments are made regarding the significance of the Level 3 inputs to the instruments fair value measurement in its entirety. If Level 3 inputs are considered significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3. The process for determining fair value using unobservable inputs is generally more subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and assumptions. We discuss changes in the valuation inputs and assumptions used in determining the fair value of our financial instruments, including the extent to which we have relied on significant unobservable inputs to estimate fair value and our process for corroborating these inputs, in Note 16 Fair Value Measurement . We have a governance framework and a number of key controls that are intended to ensure that our fair value measurements are appropriate and reliable. Our governance framework provides for independent oversight and segregation of duties. Our control processes include review and approval of new transaction types, price verification, and review of valuation judgments, methods, models, process controls and results. Groups independent of our trading and investing functions participate in the review and validation process. Tasks performed by these groups include periodic verification of fair value measurements to determine if assigned fair values are reasonable, including comparing prices from vendor pricing services to other available market information. Our Fair Value Committee ( FVC ), which includes representation from business areas, Risk Management and Finance, provides guidance and oversight to ensure an appropriate valuation control environment. The FVC regularly reviews and approves our fair valuations to ensure that our valuation practices are consistent with industry standards and adhere to regulatory and accounting guidance. We have a model policy, established by an independent Model Risk Office, which governs the validation of models and related supporting documentation to ensure the appropriate use of models for pricing and fair value measurements. The Model Risk Office validates all models and requires ongoing monitoring of their performance. The fair value governance process is set up in a manner that allows the Chairperson of the FVC to escalate valuation disputes that cannot be resolved by the FVC to a more senior committee called the Valuations Advisory Committee ( VAC ) for resolution. The VAC is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and includes other members of senior management. The VAC convenes to review escalated valuation disputes. 62 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Customer Rewards Reserve We offer products, primarily credit cards, which include programs that allow members to earn rewards based on account activity that can be redeemed for cash (primarily in the form of statement credits), gift cards, travel, or coverage of eligible charges. The amount of rewards that a customer earns varies based on the terms and conditions of the rewards program and product. The majority of our rewards do not expire and there is no limit on the amount of rewards an eligible card member can earn. Customer rewards costs, which we generally record as an offset to interchange income, are driven by various factors such as card member purchase volume, the terms and conditions of the rewards program, and rewards redemption cost. We establish a customer rewards reserve that reflects management estimate of rewards earned that are expected to be redeemed and the estimated redemption cost. We use financial models to estimate ultimate redemption rates of rewards earned to date by current card members based on historical redemption trends, current enrollee redemption behavior, card product type, year of program enrollment, enrollment tenure and card spend levels. Our current assumption is that the vast majority of all rewards earned will eventually be redeemed. We use a weighted-average redemption cost during the previous twelve months, adjusted as appropriate for recent changes in redemption costs, including the mix of rewards redeemed, to estimate future redemption costs. We continually evaluate our reserve and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns, changes to the terms and conditions of the rewards program and other factors. We recognized customer rewards expense of $4.9 billion , $4.4 billion and $3.7 billion in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Our customer rewards reserve, which is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, totaled $4.7 billion and $4.3 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. ACCOUNTING CHANGES AND DEVELOPMENTS Accounting Standards Issued but Not Adopted as of December 31, 2019 Standard Guidance Adoption Timing and Financial Statements Impacts Cloud Computing ASU No. 2018-15, Intangibles Goodwill and Other Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract Issued August 2018 Aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license). We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2020 using the prospective method of adoption. Our adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Goodwill Impairment Test Simplification ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment Issued January 2017 Eliminates the second step from the current goodwill impairment test. Under the current guidance, the first step compares a reporting unit carrying value to its fair value. If the carrying value exceeds fair value, an entity performs the second step, which assigns the reporting unit fair value to its assets and liabilities, including unrecognized assets and liabilities, in the same manner as required in purchase accounting. Under the new guidance, any impairment of a reporting unit goodwill is determined based on the amount by which the reporting unit carrying value exceeds its fair value, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2020 using the prospective method of adoption. Our adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 63 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Standard Guidance Adoption Timing and Financial Statements Impacts Current Expected Credit Loss ( CECL ) ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments Issued June 2016 Requires use of the current expected credit loss model that is based on expected losses (net of expected recoveries), rather than incurred losses, to determine our allowance for credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost, certain net investments in leases and certain off-balance sheet arrangements. Replaces current accounting for purchased credit-impaired ( PCI ) and impaired loans. Amends the other-than-temporary impairment model for available for sale debt securities to require that credit losses be recorded through an allowance approach, rather than through permanent write-downs for credit losses and subsequent accretion of positive changes through interest income over time. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2020, using the modified retrospective method of adoption. Prior to adopting this guidance, we completed evaluations of data requirements and necessary changes to our credit loss estimation methods, processes, systems and controls. We also completed model validations and multiple tests of our full end-to-end allowance processes. As a result of our adoption, we estimate an increase to our reserves for credit losses of $2.9 billion, an increase to our deferred tax assets of $698 million, and a decrease to our retained earnings of $2.2 billion. These amounts are subject to change as we finalize our adoption efforts. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for information on the accounting standards we adopted in 2019. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The level and composition of our capital are determined by multiple factors, including our consolidated regulatory capital requirements and internal risk-based capital assessments such as internal stress testing and economic capital. The level and composition of our capital may also be influenced by rating agency guidelines, subsidiary capital requirements, business environment, conditions in the financial markets and assessments of potential future losses due to adverse changes in our business and market environments. Capital Standards and Prompt Corrective Action We are subject to capital adequacy standards adopted by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ( Federal Reserve ), Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) (collectively, the Federal Banking Agencies ), including the capital rules that implemented the Basel III capital framework ( Basel III Capital Rule ) developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ( Basel Committee ). Moreover, the Banks, as insured depository institutions, are subject to Prompt Corrective Action ( PCA ) capital regulations. The Basel III Capital Rule includes the Basel III Standardized Approach and the Basel III Advanced Approaches. We entered parallel run under Basel III Advanced Approaches on January 1, 2015, during which we were required to calculate capital ratios under both the Basel III Standardized Approach and the Basel III Advanced Approaches, though we used the Standardized Approach for purposes of meeting regulatory capital requirements. In October 2019, the Federal Banking Agencies amended the Basel III Capital Rule to provide for tailored application of certain capital requirements across different categories of banking institutions ( Tailoring Rules ). As a bank holding company ( BHC ) with total consolidated assets of at least $250 billion that does not exceed any of the applicable risk-based thresholds, we are a Category III institution under the Tailoring Rules. As such, we are no longer subject to the Basel III Advanced Approaches and certain associated capital requirements, such as the requirement to include in regulatory capital certain elements of AOCI. In July 2019, the Federal Banking Agencies finalized certain changes in the Basel III Capital Rule for institutions not subject to the Basel III Advanced Approaches, including Capital One ( Capital Simplification Rule ). These changes, effective January 1, 2020, generally raise the threshold above which institutions subject to the Capital Simplification Rule must deduct certain assets from their common equity Tier 1 capital, including certain deferred tax assets, mortgage servicing assets, and investments in unconsolidated financial institutions. While the higher thresholds will not impact our current capital levels, in stress scenarios they may provide a benefit by enabling us to include more deferred tax assets in our common equity Tier 1 capital. All else equal, we anticipate that the Tailoring Rules and Capital Simplification Rule will, taken together, decrease our capital requirements. 64 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents The Basel III Capital Rule requires banking institutions to maintain a capital conservation buffer, composed of common equity Tier 1 capital, of 2.5% above the regulatory minimum ratios. In addition, Category III institutions, including the Company and the Banks, are subject to certain capital requirements formerly applicable only to Basel III Advanced Approaches banking organizations. Category III institutions are subject to a supplementary leverage ratio of 3.0% and their capital conservation buffer may be supplemented by an incremental countercyclical capital buffer of up to 2.5% composed of common equity Tier 1 capital and set at the discretion of the Federal Banking Agencies. As of December 31, 2019, the countercyclical capital buffer was zero percent in the United States. A determination to increase the countercyclical capital buffer generally would be effective twelve months after the announcement of such an increase, unless the Federal Banking Agencies set an earlier effective date. The Market Risk Rule requires institutions subject to the rule to adjust their risk-based capital ratios to reflect the market risk in their trading portfolios. As of December 31, 2019 , the Company and CONA are subject to the Market Risk Rule. See MD&A Market Risk Profile below for additional information. In December 2018, the Federal Banking Agencies revised the Basel III Capital Rule to identify which credit loss allowances under the CECL model are eligible for inclusion in regulatory capital and to provide banking organizations the option to phase in over a three-year transition period ending January 1, 2023 the day-one adverse effects on regulatory capital that may result from the adoption of the CECL model ( CECL Transition Election ). The CECL model became applicable to us as of January 1, 2020 and we intend to make the CECL Transition Election effective in the first quarter of 2020. The minimum capital requirement plus capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer for common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios is 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5%, respectively, for the Company and the Banks. A common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio, or total capital ratio below the applicable regulatory minimum ratio plus the applicable capital conservation buffer and the applicable countercyclical buffer (if set to an amount greater than zero percent) might restrict a bank ability to distribute capital and make discretionary bonus payments. The Company exceeded the minimum capital requirements and each of the Banks exceeded the minimum regulatory requirements and were well capitalized under PCA requirements as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. For the description of the regulatory capital rules we are subject to, see Part I Item 1. Business Supervision and Regulation . 65 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents On December 31, 2019, we transferred our entire portfolio of held to maturity securities to available for sale in consideration of changes to regulatory capital requirements under the Tailoring Rules, which no longer require Category III institutions to include in regulatory capital certain elements of AOCI, including unrealized gains and losses from available for sale securities. On the date of transfer, these securities had a fair value of $33.2 billion , including pre-tax unrealized gains of $1.2 billion recognized in AOCI ($888 million after-tax). Inclusive of this transfer, the AOCI associated with our available for sale securities portfolio increased our common equity Tier 1 ratio by approximately 30 basis points as of December 31, 2019, see MD&A Executive Summary and Business Outlook for more information.

As a result of this non-objection to our capital plan, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.2 billion of shares of our common stock beginning in the third quarter of 2019 through the end of the second quarter of 2020. The Board of Directors also authorized the dividend on our common stock of $0.40 per share in each quarter in 2019. For the description of the regulatory capital planning rules we are subject to, see Part I Item 1. Business Supervision and Regulation . Equity Offerings and Transactions On September 11, 2019, we issued 60,000,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of Fixed Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series I, $0.01 par value, with a liquidation preference of $25 per depositary share ( Series I Preferred Stock ). The net proceeds of the offering of Series I Preferred Stock were approximately $1.5 billion, after deducting underwriting commissions and offering expenses. Dividends on the Series I Preferred Stock are payable quarterly in arrears at a rate of 5.00% per annum. On December 2, 2019, we redeemed all outstanding shares of our Fixed Rate 6.25% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock Series C and Fixed Rate 6.70% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock Series D. The redemption reduced our net income available to common shareholders by $31 million in the fourth quarter and full year of 2019. On January 31, 2020, we issued 50,000,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of Fixed Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series J, $0.01 par value, with a liquidation preference of $25 per depositary share ( Series J Preferred Stock ). The net proceeds of the offering of Series J Preferred Stock were approximately $1.2 billion, after deducting underwriting commissions and offering expenses. Dividends on the Series J Preferred Stock are payable quarterly in arrears at a rate of 4.80% per annum. 67 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents On January 31, 2020, we announced that we will redeem all outstanding shares of our Fixed Rate 6.00% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock Series B on March 2, 2020. The redemption will reduce our net income available to common stockholders by approximately $20 million in the first quarter of 2020. Dividend Policy and Stock Purchases For the year ended December 31, 2019 , we declared and paid common stock dividends of $757 million , or $1.60 per share, and preferred stock dividends of $282 million . The following table summarizes the dividends paid per share on our various preferred stock series in each quarter of 2019 .

The declaration and payment of dividends to our stockholders, as well as the amount thereof, are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, capital levels, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors. As a BHC, our ability to pay dividends is largely dependent upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries. Regulatory restrictions exist that limit the ability of the Banks to transfer funds to our BHC. As of December 31, 2019 , funds available for dividend payments from COBNA and CONA were $3.3 billion and $4.7 billion , respectively. There can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends to stockholders. Consistent with our 2019 Stock Repurchase Program which was announced on June 27, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.2 billion of shares of common stock beginning in the third quarter of 2019 through the end of the second quarter of 2020. Through the end of 2019, we repurchased approximately $1.4 billion of shares of our common stock under the 2019 Stock Repurchase Program. The timing and exact amount of any future common stock repurchases will depend on various factors, including regulatory approval, market conditions, opportunities for growth, our capital position and the amount of retained earnings. Our stock repurchase program does not include specific price targets, may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including utilizing Rule 10b5-1 programs, and may be suspended at any time. For additional information on dividends and stock repurchases, see Part I Item 1. Business Supervision and Regulation Dividends, Stock Repurchases and Transfers of Funds . 68 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents RISK MANAGEMENT Risk Management Framework Our Risk Management Framework (the Framework ) sets consistent expectations for risk management across the Company. It also sets expectations for our Three Lines of Defense model, which defines the roles, responsibilities and accountabilities for taking and managing risk across the Company. Accountability for overseeing an effective Framework resides with our Board of Directors either directly or through its committees. The First Line of Defense consists of any line of business or function that is accountable for risk taking and is responsible for: (i) engaging in activities designed to generate revenue or reduce expenses; (ii) providing operational support or servicing to any business function for the delivery of products or services to customers; or (iii) providing technology services in direct support of first line business areas. Each line of business or first line function is responsible for managing the risks associated with their activities, including identifying, assessing, measuring, monitoring, controlling, and reporting the risks within its business activities, consistent with the risk framework. The Second Line of Defense consists of two types of functions: Independent Risk Management ( IRM ) and Support Functions. IRM oversees risk-taking activities and assesses risks and issues independent from the first line of defense. Support Functions are centers of specialized expertise (e.g., Human Resources, Accounting, Legal) that provide support services to the Company. The Third Line of Defense is comprised of the Internal Audit and Credit Review functions. The third line provides independent and objective assurance to senior management and to the Board of Directors that the first and second lines of defense have systems and governance processes which are well-designed and working as intended, and that the Framework is appropriate for our size, complexity and risk profile. Our Framework consists of the following nine elements: Governance and Accountability Strategy and Risk Alignment Risk Identification Assessment, Measurement and Response Monitoring and Testing Aggregation, Reporting and Escalation Capital and Liquidity Management (including Stress Testing) Risk Data and Enabling Technology Culture and Talent Management Governance and Accountability This element of the Framework sets the foundation for the methods for governing risk taking and the interactions within and among our three lines of defense. We established a risk governance structure and accountabilities to effectively and consistently oversee the management of risks across the Company. Our Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and management establish the tone at the top regarding the culture of the Company, including management of risk. Management reinforces expectations at the various levels of the organization. 69 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Strategy and Risk Alignment Our strategy is informed by and aligned with risk appetite, from development to execution. The Chief Executive Officer develops the strategy with input from the first, second, and third lines of defense, as well as the Board of Directors. The strategic planning process should consider relevant changes to the Company overall risk profile. Our Board of Directors approves a Risk Appetite Statement for the Company to set forth the high-level principles that govern risk taking at the Company. The Risk Appetite Statement defines the Board of Directors tolerance for certain risk outcomes at an enterprise level and enables senior management to manage and report within these boundaries. This Risk Appetite Statement is also supported by risk category specific risk appetite statements as well as metrics and, where appropriate, Board Limits and Board Notification Thresholds. Risk Identification The first line of defense and certain Support Functions, where appropriate, are expected to identify new and emerging risks across the relevant risk categories associated with their business activities and objectives, in consultation with IRM. Risk identification also must be informed by major changes in infrastructure or organization, introduction of new products and services, acquisitions of businesses, or substantial changes in the internal or external environment. IRM and certain Support Functions, where appropriate, provide effective challenge in the risk identification process. IRM is also responsible for identifying our material aggregate risks on an ongoing basis. Assessment, Measurement and Response Management is responsible for assessing risks associated with our activities. Risks identified should be assessed to understand the severity of each risk and likelihood of occurrence under both normal and stressful conditions, as appropriate. Risk severity is measured through modeling and other quantitative estimation approaches, as well as qualitative approaches, based on management judgment. As part of the risk assessment process, the first and second lines of defense also evaluate the effectiveness of the existing control environment and mitigation strategies. Management is responsible for determining the appropriate risk response. Risks may be mitigated, accepted, transferred, or avoided. Actions taken to respond to the risk may include implementing new controls, enhancing existing controls, developing additional mitigation strategies to reduce the impact of the risk, and/or monitoring the risk. Monitoring and Testing Management periodically monitors risks to evaluate and measure how the risk is affecting our strategy and business objectives, in alignment with risk appetite. The scope and frequency of monitoring activities depends on the results of relevant risk assessments, as well as specific business risk operations and activities. The first line of defense is responsible for evaluating the effectiveness of risk management practices and controls through testing and other activities. IRM and Support Functions, as appropriate, assess the first line of defense evaluation of risk management, which may include conducting effective challenge, performing independent monitoring, or conducting risk or control validations. The third line of defense provides independent assurance for first and second line risk management practices and controls to provide assurance. Aggregation, Reporting and Escalation Risk aggregation supports strategic decision making and risk management practices through collectively reporting risks across different levels of the Company and providing a comprehensive view of performance against risk appetite. Material risks, emerging risks, aggregate risks, risk appetite metrics, and other measures across all risk categories are reported to the appropriate governance forum no less than quarterly. Material risks are reported to the Board of Directors and senior management committees no less than quarterly. Capital and Liquidity Management (including Stress Testing) Our capital management processes are linked to its risk management practices, including the enterprise-wide identification, assessment, and measurement of risks to ensure that all relevant risks are incorporated in the assessment of the Company's capital 70 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents adequacy. We use identified risks to inform key aspects of the Company capital planning, including the development of stress scenarios, the assessment of the adequacy of post-stress capital levels, and the appropriateness of potential capital actions considering the Company capital objectives. We quantify capital needs through stress testing, regulatory capital, economic capital, and assessments of market considerations. In assessing its capital adequacy, we identify how and where our material risks are accounted for within the capital planning process. Monitoring and escalation processes exist for key capital thresholds and metrics to continuously monitor capital adequacy. Risk Data and Enabling Technology Risk data and technology provides the basis for risk reporting and is used in decision making and to monitor and review changes to our risk profile. There is a core Governance, Risk Management and Compliance system which is used as the system of record for risks, controls, issues, and events for our risk categories and supports the analysis, aggregation, and reporting capabilities across the categories. Culture and Talent Management The Framework must be supported with the right culture, talent, and skills to enable effective risk management across the Company. Every associate at the Company is responsible for risk management; however, associates with specific risk management skills and expertise within the first, second, and third lines of defense are critical to ensure appropriate risk management across the enterprise. Risk Categories We apply our Framework to protect the Company from the eight major categories of risk that we are exposed to through our business activities. Our eight major categories of risk are: Major Categories of Risk Compliance The risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from violations of laws, rules, or regulations. Compliance risk can also arise from nonconformance with prescribed practices, internal policies and procedures, contractual obligations, or ethical standards that reinforce those laws, rules, or regulations Credit The risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from an obligor failure to meet the terms of any contract with the Company or otherwise perform as agreed Legal The risk of material adverse impact due to new and changed laws and regulations; interpretations of law; drafting, interpretation, and enforceability of contracts; adverse decisions or consequences arising from litigation or regulatory actions; the establishment, management, and governance of the legal entity structure; and the failure to seek or follow appropriate legal counsel when needed Liquidity The risk that the Company will not be able to meet its future financial obligations as they come due, or invest in future asset growth because of an inability to obtain funds at a reasonable price within a reasonable time Market The risk that an institution earnings or the economic value of equity could be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or other market factors Operational The risk of loss, capital impairment, adverse customer experience, or reputational impact resulting from failure to comply with policies and procedures, failed internal processes or systems, or from external events Reputation The risk to market value, recruitment and retention of talented associates and maintenance of a loyal customer base due to the negative perceptions of our internal and external constituents regarding our business strategies and activities Strategic The risk of a material impact on current or anticipated earnings, capital, franchise, or enterprise value arising from the Company competitive and market position and evolving forces in the industry that can affect that position; lack of responsiveness to these conditions; strategic decisions to change the Company scale, market position, or operating model; or, failure to appropriately consider implementation risks inherent in the Company strategy 71 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents We provide an overview of how we manage our eight major categories of risk below. Compliance Risk Management We recognize that compliance requirements for financial institutions are increasingly complex and that there are heightened expectations from our regulators and our customers. In response, we continuously evaluate the regulatory environment and proactively adjust our compliance program to fully address these expectations. Our Compliance Management Program establishes expectations for determining compliance requirements, assessing the risk of new product offerings, creating appropriate controls and training to address requirements, monitoring for control performance, and independently testing for adherence to compliance requirements. The program also establishes regular compliance reporting to senior business leaders, the executive committee and the Board of Directors. The Chief Compliance Officer is responsible for establishing and overseeing our Compliance Management Program. Business areas incorporate compliance requirements and controls into their business policies, standards, processes and procedures. They regularly monitor and report on the efficacy of their compliance controls and our Corporate Compliance team periodically independently tests to validate the effectiveness of business controls. Credit Risk Management We recognize that we are exposed to cyclical changes in credit quality. Consequently, we try to ensure our credit portfolio is resilient to economic downturns. Our most important tool in this endeavor is sound underwriting. In unsecured consumer loan underwriting, we generally assume that loans will be subject to an environment in which losses are higher than those prevailing at the time of underwriting. In commercial underwriting, we generally require strong cash flow, collateral, covenants and guarantees. In addition to sound underwriting, we continually monitor our portfolio and take steps to collect or work out distressed loans. The Chief Risk Officer, in conjunction with the Consumer and Commercial Chief Credit Officers, is responsible for establishing credit risk policies and procedures, including underwriting and hold guidelines and credit approval authority, and monitoring credit exposure and performance of our lending related transactions. Our Consumer and Commercial Chief Credit Officers are responsible for evaluating the risk implications of credit strategy and the oversight of credit for both the existing portfolio and any new credit investments. They also have formal approval authority for various types and levels of credit decisions, including individual commercial loan transactions. Division Presidents within each segment are responsible for managing the credit risk within their divisions and maintaining processes to control credit risk and comply with credit policies and guidelines. In addition, the Chief Risk Officer establishes policies, delegates approval authority and monitors performance for non-loan credit exposure entered into with financial counterparties or through the purchase of credit sensitive securities in our investment portfolio. Our credit policies establish standards in five areas: customer selection, underwriting, monitoring, remediation and portfolio management. The standards in each area provide a framework comprising specific objectives and control processes. These standards are supported by detailed policies and procedures for each component of the credit process. Starting with customer selection, our goal is to generally provide credit on terms that generate above hurdle returns. We use a number of quantitative and qualitative factors to manage credit risk, including setting credit risk limits and guidelines for each of our lines of business. We monitor performance relative to these guidelines and report results and any required mitigating actions to appropriate senior management committees and our Board of Directors. Legal Risk Management The General Counsel provides legal evaluation and advice to the Company and business areas and to risk management functions such as Compliance and Internal Audit. This evaluation and advice is based on an assessment of the internal business area practices and activities and of the controls the business has in place to mitigate risks. Liquidity Risk Management We manage liquidity risk by applying our Liquidity Adequacy Framework (the Liquidity Framework ). The Liquidity Framework uses internal and regulatory stress testing and the evaluation of other balance sheet metrics to confirm that we maintain a fortified balance sheet that is resilient to uncertainties that may arise as a consequence of systemic, idiosyncratic, or combined liquidity events. We continuously monitor market and economic conditions to evaluate emerging stress conditions and to develop appropriate action plans in accordance with our Contingency Funding Plan and our Recovery Plan, which include the Company policies, 72 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents procedures and action plans for managing liquidity stress events. The Liquidity Framework enables us to manage our liquidity risk in accordance with regulatory requirements. Additionally, the Liquidity Framework establishes governing principles that apply to the management of liquidity risk. We use these principles to monitor, measure and report liquidity risk; to develop funding and investment strategies that enable us to maintain an adequate level of liquidity to support our businesses and satisfy regulatory requirements; and to protect us from a broad range of liquidity events should they arise. The Chief Risk Officer, in conjunction with the Chief Market and Liquidity Risk Officer, is responsible for the establishment of liquidity risk management policies and standards for governance and monitoring of liquidity risk at a corporate level. We assess liquidity strength by evaluating several different balance sheet metrics under severe stress scenarios to ensure we can withstand significant funding degradation through idiosyncratic, systemic, and combined liquidity stress scenarios. Management reports liquidity metrics to appropriate senior management committees and our Board of Directors no less than quarterly. We seek to mitigate liquidity risk strategically and tactically. From a strategic perspective, we have acquired and built deposit gathering businesses and actively monitor our funding concentration. From a tactical perspective, we have accumulated a sizable liquidity reserve comprised of cash and cash equivalents, high-quality, unencumbered securities and committed collateralized credit lines. We also continue to maintain access to secured and unsecured debt markets through regular issuance. This combination of stable and diversified funding sources and our stockpile of liquidity reserves enable us to maintain confidence in our liquidity position. Market Risk Management The Chief Financial Officer and the Chief Risk Officer are responsible for the establishment of market risk management policies and standards for the governance and monitoring of market risk at a corporate level. Market risk is inherent from the financial instruments associated with our business operations and activities including loans, deposits, securities, short-term borrowings, long-term debt and derivatives. We manage market risk exposure, which is principally driven by balance sheet interest rate risk, centrally and establish quantitative risk limits to monitor and control our exposure. We recognize that interest rate and foreign exchange risk is present in our business due to the nature of our assets and liabilities. Banks typically manage the trade-off between near-term earnings volatility and market value volatility by targeting moderate levels of each. In addition to using industry accepted techniques to analyze and measure interest rate and foreign exchange risk, we perform sensitivity analysis to identify our risk exposures under a broad range of scenarios. Investment securities and derivatives are the main levers for the management of interest rate risk. In addition, we also use derivatives to manage our foreign exchange risk. The market risk positions for the Company and each of the Banks are calculated separately and in aggregate, and analyzed against pre-established limits. Results are reported to the Asset Liability Committee monthly and to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors no less than quarterly. Management is authorized to utilize financial instruments as outlined in our policy to actively manage market risk exposure. Operational Risk Management We recognize the criticality of managing operational risk on both a strategic and day-to-day basis and that there are heightened expectations from our regulators and our customers. We have implemented appropriate operational risk management policies, standards, processes and controls to enable the delivery of high quality and consistent customer experiences and to achieve business objectives in a controlled manner. The Chief Operational Risk Officer is responsible for establishing and overseeing our Operational Risk Management Program. In accordance with Basel III Advanced Approaches requirements, the program establishes practices for assessing the operational risk profile and executing key control processes for operational risks. These risks include topics such as internal and external fraud, cyber and technology risk, data management, model risk, third party management, and business continuity. Operational Risk Management enforces these practices and delivers reporting of operational risk results to senior business leaders, the executive committee and the Board of Directors. 73 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Reputation Risk Management We recognize that reputation risk is of particular concern for financial institutions and, increasingly, technology companies, in the current environment. Areas of concern have expanded to include company policies, practices and values and, with the growing use of social and digital platforms, public corporations face a new level of scrutiny and channels for activism and advocacy. The heightened expectations of internal and external stakeholders have made corporate culture, values and conduct pressure points for individuals and advocates voicing concerns or seeking change. We manage both strategic and tactical reputation issues and build our relationships with government officials, media, community and consumer advocates, customers and other constituencies to help strengthen the reputations of both our Company and industry. Our actions include implementing pro-customer practices in our business and serving low to moderate income communities in our market area consistent with a quality bank and an innovative technology leader. The Executive Vice President of External Affairs is responsible for managing our overall reputation risk program. Day-to-day activities are controlled by the frameworks set forth in our Reputation Risk Management Policy and other risk management policies. Strategic Risk Management We monitor external market and industry developments to identify potential areas of strategic opportunity or risk. These items provide input for development of the Company strategy led by the Chief Executive Officer and other senior executives. Through the ongoing development and vetting of the corporate strategy, the Chief Risk Officer identifies and assesses risks associated with the strategy across all risk categories and monitors them throughout the year. CREDIT RISK PROFILE Our loan portfolio accounts for the substantial majority of our credit risk exposure. Our lending activities are governed under our credit policy and are subject to independent review and approval. Below we provide information about the composition of our loan portfolio, key concentrations and credit performance metrics. We also engage in certain non-lending activities that may give rise to credit and counterparty settlement risk, including purchasing securities for our investment securities portfolio, entering into derivative transactions to manage our market risk exposure and to accommodate customers, extending short-term advances on syndication activity including bridge financing transactions we have underwritten, depositing certain operational cash balances in other financial institutions, executing certain foreign exchange transactions and extending customer overdrafts. We provide additional information related to our investment securities portfolio under MD&A Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis Investment Securities and credit risk related to derivative transactions in Note 9 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities . Primary Loan Products We provide a variety of lending products. Our primary loan products include credit cards, auto loans and commercial lending products. We sold all of our consumer home loan portfolio and the related servicing during 2018. Credit cards: We originate both prime and subprime credit cards through a variety of channels. Our credit cards generally have variable interest rates. Credit card accounts are primarily underwritten using an automated underwriting system based on predictive models that we have developed. The underwriting criteria, which are customized for individual products and marketing programs, are established based on an analysis of the net present value of expected revenues, expenses and losses, subject to further analysis using a variety of stress conditions. Underwriting decisions are generally based on credit bureau information, including payment history, debt burden and credit scores, such as FICO scores, and on other factors, such as applicant income. We maintain a credit card securitization program and selectively sell charged-off credit card loans. Auto: We originate both prime and subprime auto loans through a network of auto dealers and direct marketing. Our auto loans generally have fixed interest rates and loan terms of 75 months or less, but can go up to 84 months. Loan size limits are customized by program and are generally less than $75,000. Similar to credit card accounts, the underwriting criteria are customized for individual products and marketing programs and based on analysis of net present value of expected revenues, expenses and losses, subject to maintaining resilience under a variety of stress conditions. Underwriting decisions are generally based on an applicant income, estimated net disposable income, and credit bureau information including FICO scores, along with collateral characteristics such as loan-to-value ( LTV ) ratio. We maintain an auto securitization program. 74 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Commercial: We offer a range of commercial lending products, including loans secured by commercial real estate and loans to middle market commercial and industrial companies. Our commercial loans may have a fixed or variable interest rate; however, the majority of our commercial loans have variable rates. Our underwriting standards require an analysis of the borrower financial condition and prospects, as well as an assessment of the industry in which the borrower operates. Where relevant, we evaluate and appraise underlying collateral and guarantees. We maintain underwriting guidelines and limits for major types of borrowers and loan products that specify, where applicable, guidelines for debt service coverage, leverage, LTV ratio and standard covenants and conditions. We assign a risk rating and establish a monitoring schedule for loans based on the risk profile of the borrower, industry segment, source of repayment, the underlying collateral and guarantees, if any, and current market conditions. Although we generally retain the commercial loans we underwrite, we may syndicate positions for risk mitigation purposes, including bridge financing transactions we have underwritten. In addition, we originate and service multifamily commercial real estate loans which are sold to government-sponsored enterprises. Portfolio Composition and Maturity Profile of Loans Held for Investment Our loan portfolio consists of loans held for investment, including loans held in our consolidated trusts, and loans held for sale.

Trends in delinquency rates are the key credit quality indicator for our credit card and retail banking loan portfolios as changes in delinquency rates can provide an early warning of changes in potential future credit losses. The key indicator we monitor when assessing the credit quality and risk of our auto loan portfolio is borrower credit scores as they provide insight into the borrower risk profile, which is an indication of potential future credit losses. The key credit quality indicator for our commercial loan portfolios is our internal risk ratings as we generally classify loans that have been delinquent for an extended period of time and other loans with significant risk of loss as nonperforming. In addition to these credit quality indicators, we also manage and monitor other credit quality metrics such as level of nonperforming loans and net charge-offs rates. We underwrite most consumer loans using proprietary models, which typically include credit bureau data, such as borrower credit scores, application information and, where applicable, collateral and deal structure data. We continuously adjust our management of credit lines and collection strategies based on customer behavior and risk profile changes. We also use borrower credit scores for subprime classification, for competitive benchmarking and, in some cases, to drive product segmentation decisions. 78 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 22 provides details on the credit scores of our domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 .

Domestic card credit scores generally represent FICO scores. These scores are obtained from one of the major credit bureaus at origination and are refreshed monthly thereafter. We approximate non-FICO credit scores to comparable FICO scores for consistency purposes. Balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 660 or below category. (2) Percentages represent period-end loans held for investment in each credit score category. Auto credit scores generally represent average FICO scores obtained from three credit bureaus at the time of application and are not refreshed thereafter. Balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 620 or below category. We present information in the section below on the credit performance of our loan portfolio, including the key metrics we use in tracking changes in the credit quality of our loan portfolio. See Note 3 Loans in this Report for additional credit quality information, and see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for information on our accounting policies for delinquent and nonperforming loans, charge-offs and troubled debt restructurings ( TDRs ) for each of our loan categories. Delinquency Rates We consider the entire balance of an account to be delinquent if the minimum required payment is not received by the customer due date, measured at each balance sheet date. Our 30+ day delinquency metrics include all loans held for investment that are 30 or more days past due, whereas our 30+ day performing delinquency metrics include loans that are 30 or more days past due but are currently classified as performing and accruing interest. The 30+ day delinquency and 30+ day performing delinquency metrics are the same for domestic credit card loans, as we continue to classify these loans as performing until the account is charged off, typically when the account is 180 days past due. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for information on our policies for classifying loans as nonperforming for each of our loan categories.

These loans consist primarily of credit card accounts between 90 days and 179 days past due. As permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, we continue to accrue interest and fees on domestic credit card loans through the date of charge-off, which is typically in the period the account becomes 180 days past due. While domestic credit card loans typically remain on accrual status until the loan is charged off, we reduce the balance of our credit card receivables by the amount of finance charges and fees billed but not expected to be collected and exclude this amount from revenue.

Interest income foregone related to nonperforming loans was $60 million and $53 million in 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Foregone interest income represents the amount of interest income in excess of recognized interest income that would have been recorded during the period for nonperforming loans as of the end of the period had the loans performed according to their contractual terms. (2) Nonperforming loan rates are calculated based on nonperforming loans for each category divided by period-end total loans held for investment for each respective category, including PCI loans as applicable. (3) Excluding the impact of domestic credit card loans, nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans held for investment was 0.67% and 0.59% as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. (4) The denominators used in calculating nonperforming asset rates consist of total loans held for investment and other nonperforming assets. 82 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Net Charge-Offs Net charge-offs consist of the unpaid principal balance of loans held for investment that we determine to be uncollectible, net of recovered amounts. We charge off loans as a reduction to the allowance for loan and lease losses when we determine the loan is uncollectible and record subsequent recoveries of previously charged-off amounts as increases to the allowance for loan and lease losses. Uncollectible finance charges and fees are reversed through revenue and certain fraud losses are recorded in other non-interest expense. Generally, costs to recover charged-off loans are recorded as collection expenses as incurred and included in our consolidated statements of income as a component of other non-interest expense. Our charge-off policy for loans varies based on the loan type. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for information on our charge-off policy for each of our loan categories. Table 27 presents our net charge-off amounts and rates, by portfolio segment, in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 .

Table 28 presents our recorded investment of loans modified in TDRs as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , which excludes loan modifications that do not meet the definition of a TDR, and PCI loans, which we track and report separately.

The effective interest rate in effect immediately prior to the loan modification is used as the effective interest rate for purposes of measuring impairment using the present value of expected cash flows. If the customer does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan agreement may revert to its original payment terms, generally resulting in any loan outstanding reflected in the appropriate delinquency category and charged off in accordance with our standard charge-off policy. In our Consumer Banking business, the majority of our loans modified in TDRs receive an extension, an interest rate reduction or principal reduction, or a combination of these concessions. In addition, TDRs also occur in connection with bankruptcy of the borrower. In certain bankruptcy discharges, the loan is written down to the collateral value and the charged-off amount is reported as principal reduction. Impairment is determined using the present value of expected cash flows or a collateral evaluation for certain auto loans where the collateral value is lower than the recorded investment. In our Commercial Banking business, the majority of loans modified in TDRs receive an extension, with a portion of these loans receiving an interest rate reduction or a gross balance reduction. The impairment on modified commercial loans is generally determined based on the underlying collateral value. We provide additional information on modified loans accounted for as TDRs, including the performance of those loans subsequent to modification, in Note 3 Loans . Impaired Loans A loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due from the borrower in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan. Generally, we report loans as impaired based on the method for measuring impairment in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. Loans defined as individually impaired include larger-balance commercial nonperforming loans and TDRs. Loans held for sale are not reported as impaired. Impaired loans also exclude PCI loans, which are accounted for based on expected cash flows because this accounting methodology takes into consideration future credit losses expected to be incurred. 84 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Impaired loans totaled $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. These amounts include TDRs of $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. We provide additional information on our impaired loans, including the allowance for loan and lease losses established for these loans, in Note 3 Loans and Note 4 Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments . Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments Our allowance for loan and lease losses represents management best estimate of incurred loan and lease credit losses inherent to our held for investment portfolio as of each balance sheet date. The allowance for loan and lease losses is increased through the provision for credit losses and reduced by net charge-offs. We provide additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used in determining our allowance for loan and lease losses under Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . Table 29 presents changes in our allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments for 2019 and 2018 , and details by portfolio segment for the provision for credit losses, charge-offs and recoveries. 85 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 29 : Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments Activity Credit Card Consumer Banking (Dollars in millions) Domestic Card International Card Businesses Total Credit Card Auto Home Loan Retail Banking Total Consumer Banking Commercial Banking Other (1) Total Allowance for loan and lease losses: Balance as of December 31, 2017 $ 5,273 $ 375 $ 5,648 $ 1,119 $ 58 $ 65 $ 1,242 $ 611 $ 1 $ 7,502 Charge-offs (6,152 ) (505 ) (6,657 ) (1,746 ) (86 ) (1,832 ) (119 ) (7 ) (8,615 ) Recoveries (2) 1,370 218 1,588 834 1 16 851 63 1 2,503 Net charge-offs (4,782 ) (287 ) (5,069 ) (912 ) 1 (70 ) (981 ) (56 ) (6 ) (6,112 ) Provision (benefit) for loan and lease losses 4,653 331 4,984 783 (6 ) 64 841 82 (49 ) 5,858 Allowance build (release) for loan and lease losses (129 ) 44 (85 ) (129 ) (5 ) (6 ) (140 ) 26 (55 ) (254 ) Other changes (1)(3) (28 ) (28 ) (53 ) (1 ) (54 ) 54 (28 ) Balance as of December 31, 2018 5,144 391 5,535 990 58 1,048 637 7,220 Reserve for unfunded lending commitments: Balance as of December 31, 2017 7 7 117 124 Provision (benefit) for losses on unfunded lending commitments (3 ) (3 ) 1 (2 ) Balance as of December 31, 2018 4 4 118 122 Combined allowance and reserve as of December 31, 2018 $ 5,144 $ 391 $ 5,535 $ 990 $ $ 62 $ 1,052 $ 755 $ $ 7,342 Allowance for loan and lease losses: Balance as of December 31, 2018 $ 5,144 $ 391 $ 5,535 $ 990 $ $ 58 $ 1,048 $ 637 $ $ 7,220 Charge-offs (6,189 ) (522 ) (6,711 ) (1,829 ) (88 ) (1,917 ) (181 ) (8,809 ) Recoveries (2) 1,371 191 1,562 953 17 970 25 2,557 Net charge-offs (4,818 ) (331 ) (5,149 ) (876 ) (71 ) (947 ) (156 ) (6,252 ) Provision for loan and lease losses 4,671 321 4,992 870 67 937 294 6,223 Allowance build (release) for loan and lease losses (147 ) (10 ) (157 ) (6 ) (4 ) (10 ) 138 (29 ) Other changes (3) 17 17 17 Balance as of December 31, 2019 4,997 398 5,395 984 54 1,038 775 7,208 Reserve for unfunded lending commitments: Balance as of December 31, 2018 4 4 118 122 Provision for losses on unfunded lending commitments 1 1 12 13 Balance as of December 31, 2019 5 5 130 135 Combined allowance and reserve as of December 31, 2019 $ 4,997 $ 398 $ 5,395 $ 984 $ $ 59 $ 1,043 $ 905 $ $ 7,343 __________ (1) In 2018, we sold all of our consumer home loan portfolio and recognized a gain of approximately $499 million in the Other category, including a benefit for credit losses of $46 million. (2) The amount and timing of recoveries is impacted by our collection strategies, which are based on customer behavior and risk profile and include direct customer communications, repossession of collateral, the periodic sale of charged-off loans as well as additional strategies, such as litigation. (3) Represents foreign currency translation adjustments and the net impact of loan transfers and sales where applicable. 86 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Allowance coverage ratios are calculated based on the allowance for loan and lease losses for each specified portfolio segment divided by period-end loans held for investment within the specified loan category. Table 30 presents the allowance coverage ratios as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 . Table 30 : Allowance Coverage Ratios December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 (Dollars in millions) Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Amount (1) Allowance Coverage Ratio Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Amount (1) Allowance Coverage Ratio Credit Card $ 5,395 $ 5,009 107.70 % $ 5,535 $ 4,668 118.56 % Consumer banking 1,038 4,627 22.42 1,048 4,360 24.04 Commercial banking 775 448 173.20 637 312 204.25 Total $ 7,208 265,809 2.71 $ 7,220 245,899 2.94 __________ (1) Represents period-end 30+ day delinquent loans for our credit card and consumer banking loan portfolios, nonperforming loans for our commercial banking loan portfolio and total loans held for investment for the total ratio . Our allowance for loan and lease losses remains substantially flat at $7.2 billion as an allowance release in our domestic credit card loan portfolio largely due to the strong economy and stable underlying credit performance was offset by an allowance build due to credit deterioration in our commercial energy loan portfolio . Our allowance coverage ratio decreased by 23 basis points to 2.71% as of December 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 primarily driven by the strong economy and stable underlying credit performance in our domestic credit card loan portfolio and the impacts from partner loss sharing arrangements, offset by higher reserves in our commercial banking business . LIQUIDITY RISK PROFILE We have established liquidity practices that are intended to ensure that we have sufficient asset-based liquidity to cover our funding requirements and maintain adequate reserves to withstand the potential impact of deposit attrition or diminished liquidity in the funding markets. In addition to our cash position, we maintain reserves in the form of investment securities and certain loans that are either readily-marketable or pledgeable. Table 31 below presents the composition of our liquidity reserves as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 . Table 31 : Liquidity Reserves (Dollars in millions) December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Cash and cash equivalents $ 13,407 $ 13,186 Investment securities portfolio: Investment securities available for sale, at fair value 79,213 46,150 Investment securities held to maturity, at fair value 36,619 Total investment securities portfolio 79,213 82,769 FHLB borrowing capacity secured by loans 10,835 10,003 Outstanding FHLB advances and letters of credit secured by loans (7,210 ) (9,726 ) Investment securities encumbered for Public Funds and others (5,688 ) (6,631 ) Total liquidity reserves $ 90,557 $ 89,601 Our liquidity reserves increased by $956 million to $90.6 billion as of December 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 primarily driven by a decrease in our FHLB advances outstanding. See MD&A Risk Management for additional information on our management of liquidity risk. 87 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Liquidity Coverage Ratio We are subject to the Liquidity Coverage Ratio Rule ( LCR Rule ) as implemented by the Federal Reserve and OCC. The LCR Rule requires us to calculate our LCR daily. It also requires the Company to publicly disclose, on a quarterly basis, its LCR, certain related quantitative liquidity metrics, and a qualitative discussion of its LCR. Our average LCR during the fourth quarter of 2019 exceeded the LCR Rule requirement of 100%. The calculation and the underlying components are based on our interpretations, expectations and assumptions of relevant regulations, as well as interpretations provided by our regulators, and are subject to change based on changes to future regulations and interpretations. Under the Tailoring Rules, we are subject to a reduced LCR requirement, which we do not expect will have a significant impact on the Company publicly disclosed LCR. See Part I Item 1. Business Supervision and Regulation for additional information. Borrowing Capacity We maintain a shelf registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) so that we may periodically offer and sell an indeterminate aggregate amount of senior or subordinated debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock, purchase contracts, warrants and units. There is no limit under this shelf registration to the amount or number of such securities that we may offer and sell, subject to market conditions. In addition, we also maintain a shelf registration that allows us to periodically offer and sell up to $25 billion of securitized debt obligations from our credit card loan securitization trust and a shelf registration that allows us to periodically offer and sell up to $20 billion from our auto loan securitization trusts. In addition to our issuance capacity under the shelf registration statements, we also have access to FHLB advances and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The ability to borrow utilizing these sources is based on membership status and the amount is dependent upon the Banks ability to post collateral. As of December 31, 2019 , we pledged both loans and securities to FHLB to secure a maximum borrowing capacity of $18.7 billion , of which $11.5 billion was still available to us to borrow. Our FHLB membership is supported by our investment in FHLB stock of $328 million and $415 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, which was determined in part based on our outstanding advances. As of December 31, 2019 , we pledged loans to secure a borrowing capacity of $5.3 billion under the Federal Reserve Discount Window. Our membership with the Federal Reserve is supported by our investment in Federal Reserve stock, which totaled $1.3 billion as of both December 31, 2019 and 2018 . Funding Our primary source of funding comes from deposits, as they are a stable and relatively low cost source of funding. In addition to deposits, we raise funding through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, securitized debt obligations, federal funds purchased, securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, and FHLB advances secured by certain portions of our loan and securities portfolios. A key objective in our use of these markets is to maintain access to a diversified mix of wholesale funding sources. See MD&A Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis Funding Sources Composition for additional information on our primary sources of funding. 88 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Deposits Table 32 provides a comparison of average balances, interest expense and average deposit interest rates for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 .

In addition, we may utilize short-term and long-term FHLB advances secured by certain of our investment securities, multifamily real estate loans, and commercial real estate loans. Our short-term borrowings include those borrowings with an original contractual maturity of one year or less and do not include the current portion of long-term debt. The short-term borrowings, which consist of short-term FHLB advances and federal funds purchased, securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, decreased by $2.1 billion to $7.3 billion as of December 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 driven by maturities of our short-term FHLB advances. 89 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Our long-term debt, which primarily consists of securitized debt obligations, senior and subordinated notes, and long-term FHLB advances, decreased by $1.1 billion to $48.4 billion as of December 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 driven by maturities exceeding issuances. We provide more information on our securitization activity in Note 5 Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations . The following table summarizes issuances of securitized debt obligations, senior and subordinated notes, and FHLB advances and their respective maturities or redemptions for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 .

Credit Ratings Our credit ratings impact our ability to access capital markets and our borrowing costs. Rating agencies base their ratings on numerous factors, including liquidity, capital adequacy, asset quality, quality of earnings and the probability of systemic support. Significant changes in these factors could result in different ratings. Table 35 provides a summary of the credit ratings for the senior unsecured long-term debt of Capital One Financial Corporation, COBNA and CONA as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 .

Contractual Obligations In the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments that affect our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. Our future cash outflows primarily relate to deposits, borrowings and operating leases. Table 36 summarizes, by remaining contractual maturity, our significant contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2019 . The actual timing and amounts of future cash payments may differ from the amounts presented below due to a number of factors, such as discretionary debt repurchases. Table 36 excludes short-term obligations such as trade payables, commitments to fund certain equity investments, obligations for pension and post-retirement benefit plans, and representation and warranty reserves, which are discussed in more detail in Note 5 Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations , Note 14 Employee Benefit Plans and Note 18 Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others . 90 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 36 : Contractual Obligations December 31, 2019 (Dollars in millions) Up to 1 Year > 1 Years to 3 Years > 3 Years to 5 Years > 5 Years Total Interest-bearing time deposits (1)(2) $ 28,186 $ 12,887 $ 3,775 $ 110 $ 44,958 Securitized debt obligations (2) 5,433 8,549 2,256 1,570 17,808 Other debt: Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase 314 314 Senior and subordinated notes 4,398 9,046 8,707 8,321 30,472 Other borrowings (3) 7,022 40 23 18 7,103 Total other debt (2) 11,734 9,086 8,730 8,339 37,889 Operating leases 310 535 437 782 2,064 Purchase obligations (4) 470 769 553 400 2,192 Total $ 46,133 $ 31,826 $ 15,751 $ 11,201 $ 104,911 __________ (1) Includes only those interest-bearing deposits which have a contractual maturity date. (2) These amounts represent the carrying value of the obligations and do not include amounts related to contractual interest obligations. Total contractual interest obligations were approximately $4.1 billion as of December 31, 2019 , and represent forecasted net interest payments based on interest rates as of December 31, 2019 . These forecasts use the contractual maturity date of each liability and include the impact of hedge accounting where applicable. (3) Other borrowings primarily consists of FHLB advances.

Purchase obligations are included through the termination date of the agreements even if the contract is renewable. MARKET RISK PROFILE Market risk is the risk of economic loss in the value of our financial instruments due to changes in market factors. Our primary market risk exposures include interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and commodity pricing risk. We are exposed to market risk primarily from the following operations and activities: Traditional banking activities of deposit gathering and lending; Asset/liability management activities including the management of investment securities, short-term and long-term borrowings and derivatives; Foreign operations in the U.K. and Canada within our Credit Card business; and Customer accommodation activities within our Commercial Banking business. We have enterprise-wide risk management policies and limits, approved by our Board of Directors, which govern our market risk management activities. Our objective is to manage our exposure to market risk in accordance with these policies and limits based on prevailing market conditions and long-term expectations. We provide additional information below about our primary sources of market risk, our market risk management strategies and the measures that we use to evaluate these exposures. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk represents exposure to financial instruments whose values vary with the level or volatility of interest rates. We are exposed to interest rate risk primarily from the differences in the timing between the maturities or re-pricing of assets and liabilities. We manage our interest rate risk primarily by entering into interest rate swaps and other derivative instruments, including caps, floors, options, futures and forward contracts. We use various industry standard market risk measurement techniques and analyses to measure, assess and manage the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and our economic value of equity and changes in foreign exchange rates on our non-dollar-denominated funding and non-dollar equity investments in foreign operations. 91 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Net Interest Income Sensitivity Our net interest income sensitivity measure estimates the impact on our projected 12-month baseline interest rate-sensitive revenue resulting from movements in interest rates. Interest rate-sensitive revenue consists of net interest income and certain components of other non-interest income significantly impacted by movements in interest rates, including changes in the fair value of freestanding interest rate derivatives. In addition to our existing assets and liabilities, we incorporate expected future business growth assumptions, such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, and plans for projected changes in our funding mix in our baseline forecast. In measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our projected interest rate-sensitive revenue, we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates detailed in Table 37 below. At the current level of interest rates, our interest rate sensitive revenue is expected to increase modestly in higher rate scenarios and decrease modestly in lower rate scenarios. Economic Value of Equity Our economic value of equity sensitivity measure estimates the impact on the net present value of our assets and liabilities, including derivative exposures, resulting from movements in interest rates. Our economic value of equity sensitivity measure is calculated based on our existing assets and liabilities, including derivatives, and does not incorporate business growth assumptions or projected balance sheet changes. Key assumptions used in the calculation include projecting rate sensitive prepayments for mortgage securities, loans and other assets, term structure modeling of interest rates, discount spreads, and deposit volume and pricing assumptions. In measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our economic value of equity, we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates detailed in Table 37 below. Our current economic value of equity sensitivity profile demonstrates that our economic value of equity generally decreases as interest rates decrease from the current levels. Table 37 shows the estimated percentage impact on our projected baseline net interest income and economic value of equity calculated under the methodology described above as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 . In instances where a declining interest rate scenario would result in a rate less than 0%, we assume a rate of 0% for that scenario. Table 37 : Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Estimated impact on projected baseline net interest income: +200 basis points 1.8 % (0.8 )% +100 basis points 1.3 (0.2 ) +50 basis points 1.1 0.0 50 basis points (0.5 ) (0.3 ) 100 basis points (1.7 ) (1.0 ) Estimated impact on economic value of equity: +200 basis points (3.6 ) (7.1 ) +100 basis points 0.5 (2.9 ) +50 basis points 0.8 (1.2 ) 50 basis points (2.4 ) 0.2 100 basis points (6.6 ) (0.8 ) In addition to these industry standard measures, we also consider the potential impact of alternative interest rate scenarios, such as stressed rate shocks as well as steepening and flattening yield curve scenarios in our internal interest rate risk management decisions. Limitations of Market Risk Measures The interest rate risk models that we use in deriving these measures incorporate contractual information, internally-developed assumptions and proprietary modeling methodologies, which project borrower and depositor behavior patterns in certain interest rate environments. Other market inputs, such as interest rates, market prices and interest rate volatility, are also critical components of our interest rate risk measures. We regularly evaluate, update and enhance these assumptions, models and analytical tools as we believe appropriate to reflect our best assessment of the market environment and the expected behavior patterns of our existing assets and liabilities. 92 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents There are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates. The sensitivity analysis described above contemplates only certain movements in interest rates and is performed at a particular point in time based on the existing balance sheet and, in some cases, expected future business growth and funding mix assumptions. The strategic actions that management may take to manage our balance sheet may differ significantly from our projections, which could cause our actual earnings and economic value of equity sensitivities to differ substantially from the above sensitivity analysis. For further information on our interest rate exposures, see Note 9 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities . Foreign Exchange Risk Foreign exchange risk represents exposure to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in other currencies. We are exposed to foreign exchange risk primarily from the intercompany funding denominated in the pound sterling ( GBP ) and the Canadian dollar ( CAD ) that we provide to our businesses in the U.K. and Canada and net equity investments in those businesses. We are also exposed to foreign exchange risk due to changes in the dollar-denominated value of future earnings and cash flows from our foreign operations and from our Euro ( EUR )-denominated borrowings. Our non-dollar denominated intercompany funding and EUR-denominated borrowings expose our earnings to foreign exchange transaction risk. We manage these transaction risks by using forward foreign currency derivatives and cross-currency swaps to hedge our exposures. We measure our foreign exchange transaction risk exposures by applying a 1% U.S. dollar appreciation shock against the value of the non-dollar denominated intercompany funding and EUR-denominated borrowings and their related hedges, which shows the impact to our earnings from foreign exchange risk. Our intercompany funding outstanding was 761 million GBP and 756 million GBP as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, and 6.6 billion CAD and 6.5 billion CAD as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Our EUR-denominated borrowings outstanding were 1.2 billion EUR as of December 31, 2019 . Our non-dollar equity investments in foreign operations expose our balance sheet to translation risk in AOCI and our capital ratios. We manage our AOCI exposure by entering into foreign currency derivatives designated as net investment hedges. We measure these exposures by applying a 30% U.S. dollar appreciation shock, which we believe approximates a significant adverse shock over a one-year time horizon, against the value of the net equity invested in our foreign operations related net investment hedges where applicable. Our gross equity exposures in our U.K. and Canadian operations were 1.6 billion GBP as of both December 31, 2019 and 2018 , and 1.4 billion CAD and 1.2 billion CAD as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. As a result of our derivative management activities, we believe our net exposure to foreign exchange risk is minimal. Risk related to Customer Accommodation Derivatives We offer interest rate, commodity and foreign currency derivatives as an accommodation to our customers within our Commercial Banking business. We offset the majority of the market risk of these customer accommodation derivatives by entering into offsetting derivatives transactions with other counterparties. We use value-at-risk ( VaR ) as the primary method to measure the market risk in our customer accommodation derivative activities on a daily basis. VaR is a statistical risk measure used to estimate the potential loss from movements observed in the recent market environment. We employ an historical simulation approach using the most recent 500 business days and use a 99 percent confidence level and a holding period of one business day. As a result of offsetting our customer exposures with other counterparties, we believe that our net exposure to market risk in our customer accommodation derivatives is minimal. For further information on our risk related to customer accommodation derivatives, see Note 9 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities . London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) Transition On July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, the regulator for the administration of LIBOR, announced that LIBOR would be transitioned as an interest rate benchmark and that it will no longer compel banks to contribute LIBOR data beyond December 31, 2021. It is unclear what rate or rates may develop as accepted alternatives to LIBOR, or what the effect of any such changes may have on the markets for LIBOR-based financial instruments. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York established the Alternative Reference Rates Committee ( ARRC ), a group of private market participants and ex-officio members representing banking and financial sector regulators. ARRC has recommended the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ( SOFR ) as the preferred alternative rate for certain U.S. dollar derivative and cash instruments. We have exposures to LIBOR, including loans, derivative contracts, unsecured debt, securitizations, vendor agreements and other instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. To facilitate an orderly transition from LIBOR, 93 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents we have established a company-wide, cross-functional initiative to oversee and manage our transition away from LIBOR and other Interbank Offered Rates ( IBORs ) to alternative reference rates. We have made progress on our transition efforts as we: implemented a robust governance framework and transition planning; completed initial assessment of exposures in products, legal contracts, systems, models and processes; included LIBOR transition language ( fallback language ) for new legal contracts/agreements; and issued our first debt security with a SOFR-based floating rate component in January 2020. We also continue to focus our transition efforts on: reviewing existing legal contracts/agreements and assessing fallback language impacts; monitoring of our LIBOR exposure; assessing internal operational readiness and risk management; implementing necessary updates to our infrastructure including systems, models, valuation tools and processes; engaging with our clients, industry working groups, and regulators; and monitoring developments associated with LIBOR alternatives and industry practices related to LIBOR-indexed instruments.

Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the Company Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Capital One internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that the Company receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 , based on the framework in 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ), commonly referred to as the 2013 Framework. Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2019 , the Company internal control over financial reporting was effective based on the criteria established by COSO in the 2013 Framework. Additionally, based upon management assessment, the Company determined that there were no material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 . The effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 , has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their accompanying report, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 . /s/ RICHARD D. FAIRBANK Richard D. Fairbank Chair, Chief Executive Officer and President /s/ R. SCOTT BLACKLEY R. Scott Blackley Chief Financial Officer February 20, 2020 110 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Capital One Financial Corporation: Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited Capital One Financial Corporation internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control- Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Capital One Financial Corporation (the Company ) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of Capital One Financial Corporation as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes, and our report dated February 20, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Tysons, Virginia February 20, 2020 111 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Capital One Financial Corporation: Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Capital One Financial Corporation (the Company ) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 20, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 112 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Allowance for loan and lease losses - Credit Card and Consumer Banking Description of the Matter At December 31, 2019, the Company allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL or allowance) for the credit card and consumer banking portfolios was $5.4 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively. As more fully described in Note 1 and Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements, the ALLL represents management best estimate of incurred loan and lease losses in the held for investment (HFI) loan portfolios as of the balance sheet date and is comprised of two elements. The first is quantitative and involves the use of complex econometric statistical loss forecasting models tailored to each portfolio based on, among other things, historical loss and recovery experience, recent trends in delinquencies and charge-offs, underwriting and collection management policies, seasonality, the value of collateral underlying secured loans, and general economic conditions. The second is qualitative and involves factors that represent management judgment of the imprecision and risks inherent in the processes not lending themselves to empirical derivation. Auditing the allowance for the credit card and consumer banking portfolios was especially challenging and highly judgmental due to the significant complexity of the loss forecasting models used in the quantitative element and the significant judgment required in establishing the qualitative element. The qualitative element requires management to make significant judgments regarding the imprecision and risk inherent in the process and assumptions used in establishing the allowance, including modeling assumption and adjustment risks, probable internal and external events, and uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment and how that impacts losses. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the internal controls over the ALLL process, including, among others, controls over the development, operation, and monitoring of loss forecasting models and management review controls over key assumptions and qualitative judgments used in reviewing the final credit card and consumer banking allowance results. Our tests of controls included observation of certain of management quarterly ALLL governance meetings, at which key management judgments, qualitative adjustments, and final ALLL results are subjected to critical challenge by management groups independent of the ALLL calculation. We involved EY specialists in testing management credit card and consumer banking econometric statistical loss forecasting models including evaluating model methodology, model performance and testing key modeling assumptions as well as model governance controls. We compared actual loss history with prior forecasts at a disaggregated loan portfolio level to evaluate the reasonableness of management consumer forecasts (e.g., look-back analysis). We performed quarterly sensitivity analysis on the ALLL, charge-off and delinquency rates, and coverage ratios used within each segment of the credit card and consumer banking allowance. Our audit response also included specific substantive tests of management process to measure credit card and consumer banking qualitative factors. We compared calculations to external consumer market benchmarks and industry peer data and compared qualitative factors to prior periods and prior economic cycles. We also evaluated if the credit card and consumer banking allowance qualitative factors were applied based on a comprehensive framework and that all available information was considered, well-documented, and consistently applied. 113 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Goodwill Impairment Assessment Description of the Matter At December 31, 2019, the Company goodwill was $14.7 billion recorded across four reporting units. As discussed in Note 1 and Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. Management uses a discounted cash flow analysis (DCF) to calculate the fair value of its reporting units. Auditing of the annual goodwill impairment test was especially challenging, complex, and highly judgmental due to the significant estimation required in determining the fair value of the reporting units. The fair value estimate is sensitive to significant assumptions including prospective financial information (PFI) and market discount rates. These PFI assumptions require management to make judgments about future loan and deposit growth, revenue and expenses, credit losses, and capital rates. Management utilizes a financial forecasting process to estimate the PFI and an estimation process to determine the appropriate discount rates. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit Our audit procedures related to the goodwill impairment assessment included, among others, testing the design and operating effectiveness of controls over the Company PFI forecasting process and management impairment assessment process, including controls over the estimation of discount rates. To test the appropriateness of management assessment process, we assessed the goodwill impairment methodology and involved EY valuation specialists to assist in the testing of the significant assumptions, including testing the Company estimate of discount rates, and evaluating the reasonableness of total fair value through comparison to the Company market capitalization and analysis of the resulting premium to applicable market transactions. We evaluated certain of management assumptions with historical performance (e.g., trend analysis), current industry and economic trends, changes in the Company strategies, and the customer base or product mix. We also evaluated the consistency of the PFI by comparing the projections to other analyses used within the organization and inquiries performed of senior management regarding strategic plans within each reporting unit. We compared prior year forecasts to current year actual performance. We performed sensitivity analyses related to the significant assumptions to evaluate the change in the fair value of the reporting units resulting from changes in the assumptions. We also recalculated the reconciliation of the fair value of all reporting units to the market capitalization of the Company and then assessed the resulting premium. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company auditor since 1994.

Capital One Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company ) offer a broad array of financial products and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients through digital channels, branches, Caf and other distribution channels. As of December 31, 2019 , our principal subsidiaries included: Capital One Bank (USA), National Association ( COBNA ), which offers credit and debit card products, other lending products and deposit products; and Capital One, National Association ( CONA ), which offers a broad spectrum of banking products and financial services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients. The Company is hereafter collectively referred to as we, us or our. COBNA and CONA are collectively referred to as the Banks. We also offer products outside of the United States of America ( U.S. ) principally through Capital One (Europe) plc ( COEP ), an indirect subsidiary of COBNA organized and located in the United Kingdom ( U.K. ), and through a branch of COBNA in Canada. COEP has authority, among other things, to provide credit card loans. Our branch of COBNA in Canada also has the authority to provide credit card loans. Our principal operations are organized for management reporting purposes into three major business segments, which are defined primarily based on the products and services provided or the types of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. We provide details on our business segments, the integration of recent acquisitions, if any, into our business segments and the allocation methodologies and accounting policies used to derive our business segment results in Note 17 Business Segments and Revenue from Contracts with Customers . Basis of Presentation and Use of Estimates The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ( U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and in the related disclosures. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. While management makes its best judgments, actual amounts or results could differ from these estimates. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Capital One Financial Corporation and all other entities in which we have a controlling financial interest. We determine whether we have a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity ( VOE ) or a variable interest entity ( VIE ). All significant intercompany account balances and transactions have been eliminated. Voting Interest Entities VOEs are entities that have sufficient equity and provide the equity investors voting rights that give them the power to make significant decisions relating to the entity operations. Since a controlling financial interest in an entity is typically obtained through ownership of a majority voting interest, we consolidate our majority-owned subsidiaries and other voting interest entities in which we hold, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting rights or where we exercise control through other contractual rights. Investments in which we do not hold a controlling financial interest but have significant influence over the entity financial and operating decisions (generally defined as owning a voting interest of 20% to 50%) are accounted for under the equity method. If we own less than 20% of a voting interest entity, we measure equity investments at fair value with changes in fair value recorded 120 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS through net income, except those that do not have a readily determinable fair value (for which a measurement alternative is applied). We report equity investments in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets and include our share of income or loss and dividends from those investments in other non-interest income in our consolidated statements of income. Variable Interest Entities VIEs are entities that, by design, either (i) lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties; or (ii) have equity investors that do not have the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity operations through voting rights, or do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses, or do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. The entity that is deemed the primary beneficiary of a VIE is required to consolidate the VIE. An entity is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE if that entity has both (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE economic performance; and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. In determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE, we consider both qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the nature, size and form of our involvement with the VIE, such as our role in establishing the VIE and our ongoing rights and responsibilities; our economic interests, including debt and equity investments, servicing fees and other arrangements deemed to be variable interests in the VIE; the design of the VIE, including the capitalization structure, subordination of interests, payment priority, relative share of interests held across various classes within the VIE capital structure and the reasons why the interests are held by us. We perform on-going reassessments to evaluate whether changes in an entity capital structure or changes in the nature of our involvement with the entity result in a change to the VIE designation or a change to our consolidation conclusion. See Note 5 Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations for further details. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits and other short-term investments, all of which, if applicable, have stated maturities of three months or less when acquired. Securities Resale and Repurchase Agreements Securities purchased under resale agreements and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, principally U.S. government and agency obligations, are not accounted for as sales but as collateralized financing transactions and recorded at the amounts at which the securities were acquired or sold, plus accrued interest. We continually monitor the market value of these securities and deliver additional collateral to or obtain additional collateral from counterparties, as appropriate. See Note 8 Deposits and Borrowings for further details. Investment Securities Our investment portfolio consists primarily of the following: U.S. Treasury securities; U.S. government-sponsored enterprise or agency ( Agency ) and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities ( RMBS ); Agency commercial mortgage-backed securities ( CMBS ); and other securities. The accounting and measurement framework for our investment securities differs depending on the security classification. We classify securities as available for sale or held to maturity based on our investment strategy and management assessment of our intent and ability to hold the securities until maturity. Securities that we may sell prior to maturity in response to changes in our investment strategy, liquidity needs, interest rate risk profile or for other reasons are classified as available for sale. Securities that we have the intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held to maturity. We report securities available for sale on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses recorded, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ). We report securities held to maturity on our consolidated balance sheets at carrying value, which generally equals amortized cost. Amortized cost reflects historical cost adjusted for amortization of premiums, accretion of discounts and any previously recorded impairments. Investment securities transferred into the held to maturity category from the available for sale category are recorded at fair value at the date of transfer. Any unrealized gains or losses at the transfer date are thereafter included in AOCI. Such unrealized gains or losses are accreted over the remaining life of the security and are expected to offset the amortization of the related premium or discount created upon the investment securities transfer into the held to maturity category, with no expected impact on future net income. 121 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Unamortized premiums, discounts and other basis adjustments are recognized in interest income over the contractual lives of the securities using the effective interest method. We record purchases and sales of investment securities on a trade date basis. Realized gains or losses from the sale of debt securities are computed using the first in first out method of identification, and are included in non-interest income in our consolidated statements of income. If we intend to sell an available for sale security in an unrealized loss position or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, the entire difference between the amortized cost basis of the security and its fair value is recognized in our consolidated statements of income. We regularly evaluate our securities whose fair values have declined below amortized cost to assess whether the decline in fair value represents an other than temporary impairment ( OTTI ). We discuss our assessment and accounting for OTTI in Note 2 Investment Securities . We discuss the techniques we use in determining the fair value of our investment securities in Note 16 Fair Value Measurement . Our investment portfolio also includes certain acquired debt securities that were deemed to be credit impaired at the acquisition date, and therefore are accounted for in accordance with accounting guidance for purchased credit-impaired ( PCI ) loans and debt securities. These securities are recorded at fair value at the acquisition date using the estimated cash flows we expect to collect discounted by the prevailing market interest rate. The difference between the contractually required payments due and the undiscounted cash flows we expect to collect at acquisition, considering the impact of prepayments, is referred to as the nonaccretable difference. The nonaccretable difference reflects estimated future credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the security, and is recorded as a discount to the related debt security on our consolidated balance sheet. The excess of the undiscounted cash flows expected to be collected over the estimated fair value of credit-impaired debt securities at acquisition is referred to as the accretable yield, which is accreted into interest income using an effective yield method over the remaining life of the security. Further decreases in expected cash flows attributable to credit result in the recognition of OTTI. Significant increases in expected cash flows are recognized prospectively over the remaining life of the security as an adjustment to the accretable yield. See the Loans Acquired section of this Note for further discussion of accounting guidance for PCI loans and debt securities. Loans Our loan portfolio consists of loans held for investment, including loans underlying our consolidated securitization trusts, and loans held for sale, and is divided into three portfolio segments: credit card, consumer banking and commercial banking loans. Credit card loans consist of domestic and international credit card loans. Consumer banking loans consist of auto and retail banking loans. Commercial banking loans consist of commercial and multifamily real estate as well as commercial and industrial loans. Loan Classification Upon origination or purchase, we classify loans as held for investment or held for sale based on our investment strategy and management intent and ability with regard to the loans, which may change over time. The accounting and measurement framework for loans differs depending on the loan classification, whether we elect the fair value option, whether the loans are originated or purchased and whether purchased loans are considered credit-impaired at the date of acquisition. The presentation within the consolidated statements of cash flows is based on management intent at acquisition or origination. Cash flows related to loans held for investment are included in cash flows from investing activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows. Cash flows related to loans held for sale are included in cash flows from operating activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows. Loans Held for Investment Loans that we have the ability and intent to hold for the foreseeable future and loans associated with consolidated securitization transactions are classified as held for investment. Loans classified as held for investment, except PCI loans described below, are reported at their amortized cost, which is the outstanding principal balance, adjusted for any unearned income, unamortized deferred fees and costs, unamortized premiums and discounts and charge-offs. Credit card loans also include billed finance charges and fees, net of the estimated uncollectible amount. Interest income is recognized on performing loans held for investment on an accrual basis. We defer loan origination fees and direct loan origination costs on originated loans, premiums and discounts on purchased loans and loan commitment fees. We recognize these amounts in interest income as yield adjustments over the life of the loan and/or commitment period using the effective interest method. For credit card loans, loan origination fees and direct loan origination costs are amortized on a straight- 122 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS line basis over a 12 -month period. Loans held for investment are subject to our allowance for loan and lease losses methodology described below under Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses. Loans Held for Sale Loans purchased or originated with the intent to sell or for which we do not have the ability and intent to hold for the foreseeable future are classified as held for sale. Multifamily commercial real estate loans originated with the intent to sell to government-sponsored enterprises are accounted for under the fair value option. We elect the fair value option on these loans as part of our management of interest rate risk with corresponding forward sale commitments. Loan origination fees and direct loan origination costs are recognized as incurred and are reported in other non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income. Interest income is calculated based on the loan's stated rate of interest and is reported in interest income in the consolidated statements of income. Fair value adjustments are recorded in other non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income. All other loans classified as held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. Loan origination fees, direct loan origination costs and any discounts and premiums are deferred until the loan is sold and are then recognized as part of the total gain or loss on sale. The fair value of these loans is determined on an aggregate portfolio basis for each loan type. Fair value adjustments are recorded in other non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income. If a loan is transferred from held for investment to held for sale, then on the transfer date, any decline in fair value related to credit is recorded as a charge-off. Subsequent to transfer, we report write-downs or recoveries in fair value up to the carrying value at the date of transfer and realized gains or losses on loans held for sale in our consolidated statements of income as a component of other non-interest income. We calculate the gain or loss on loan sales as the difference between the proceeds received and the carrying value of the loans sold, net of the fair value of any residual interests retained. Loans Acquired All purchased loans, including loans transferred in a business combination, are initially recorded at fair value, which includes consideration of expected future losses, as of the date of the acquisition. To determine the fair value of loans at acquisition, we estimate discounted contractual cash flows due using an observable market rate of interest, when available, adjusted for factors that a market participant would consider in determining fair value. In determining fair value, contractual cash flows are adjusted to include prepayment estimates based upon trends in default rates and loss severities. The difference between the fair value and the contractual cash flows is recorded as a loan discount or premium at acquisition. Subsequent to acquisition, the loans are classified and accounted for as either held for investment or held for sale based on management ability and intent with regard to the loans. Loans held for investment are subject to our allowance for loan and lease losses methodology described below under Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses. We account for purchased loans under the accounting guidance for purchased credit-impaired loans and debt securities, which is based upon expected cash flows, if the purchased loans have a discount attributable, at least in part, to credit deterioration and they are not specifically scoped out of the guidance. We refer to these purchased loans that are subsequently accounted for based on expected cash flows to be collected as PCI loans. Other purchased loans that do not meet the criteria described above or are specifically scoped out of this guidance are accounted for based on contractual cash flows. Loans Acquired and Accounted for Based on Expected Cash Flows For PCI loans, the excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the estimated fair value of purchased loans is referred to as the accretable yield. This amount is not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets, but is accreted into interest income over the life of the loan, or pool of loans, using the effective interest method. The difference between total contractual payments on the loans and all expected cash flows represents the nonaccretable difference or the amount of principal and interest not considered collectible. We may aggregate loans acquired in the same fiscal quarter into one or more pools if the loans have common risk characteristics. A pool is then accounted for as a single asset, with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate fair value and expected cash flows. Subsequent to acquisition, changes in the estimated cash flows expected to be collected may result in changes in the accretable yield and nonaccretable difference or reclassifications from the nonaccretable difference to the accretable yield. Decreases in 123 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS expected cash flows resulting from credit deterioration subsequent to acquisition will generally result in an impairment charge recognized in our provision for credit losses and an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses. Significant increases in the cash flows expected to be collected would first reduce any previously recorded allowance for loan and lease losses. The excess over the recorded allowance for loan and lease losses would result in a reclassification to the accretable yield from the nonaccretable difference and an increase in interest income recognized over the remaining life of the loan or pool of loans. Disposals of loans in the form of sales to third parties, receipt of payment in full or in part by the borrower, and foreclosure of the collateral, result in removal of the loan from the PCI loans portfolio. See Note 3 Loans for additional information. Loan Modifications and Restructurings As part of our loss mitigation efforts, we may provide modifications to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty to improve the long-term collectability of the loan and to avoid the need for foreclosure or repossession of collateral, if any. A loan modification in which a concession is granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty is accounted for and reported as a troubled debt restructuring ( TDR ). Our loan modifications typically include an extension of the loan term, a reduction in the interest rate, a reduction in the loan balance, or a combination of these concessions. We describe our accounting for and measurement of impairment on TDR loans below under Impaired Loans. See Note 3 Loans for additional information on our loan modifications and restructurings. Delinquent and Nonperforming Loans The entire balance of a loan is considered contractually delinquent if the minimum required payment is not received by the first statement cycle date equal to or following the due date specified on the customer billing statement. Delinquency is reported on loans that are 30 or more days past due. Interest and fees continue to accrue on past due loans until the date the loan is placed on nonaccrual status, if applicable. We generally place loans on nonaccrual status when we believe the collectability of interest and principal is not reasonably assured. Nonperforming loans generally include loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status. We do not report loans classified as held for sale as nonperforming. Our policies for classifying loans as nonperforming, by loan category, are as follows: Credit card loans: As permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council ( FFIEC ), our policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being classified as nonperforming, as these loans are generally charged off in the period the account becomes 180 days past due. Consistent with industry conventions, we generally continue to accrue interest and fees on delinquent credit card loans until the loans are charged-off. Consumer banking loans: We classify consumer banking loans as nonperforming when we determine that the collectability of all interest and principal on the loan is not reasonably assured, generally when the loan becomes 90 days past due. Commercial banking loans : We classify commercial banking loans as nonperforming as of the date we determine that the collectability of all interest and principal on the loan is not reasonably assured. Modified loans and troubled debt restructurings: Modified loans, including TDRs, that are current at the time of the restructuring remain on accrual status if there is demonstrated performance prior to the restructuring and continued performance under the modified terms is expected. Otherwise, the modified loan is classified as nonperforming. PCI loans: PCI loans are not classified as delinquent or nonperforming. Interest and fees accrued but not collected as of the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status are reversed against earnings. In addition, the amortization of net deferred loan fees is suspended. Interest and fee income is subsequently recognized only upon the receipt of cash payments. However, if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of loan principal, cash received is generally applied against the principal balance of the loan. Nonaccrual loans are generally returned to accrual status when all principal and interest is current and repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is reasonably assured, or when the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection and collectability is no longer doubtful. 124 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Impaired Loans A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due from the borrower in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan. Generally, we report loans as impaired based on the method for measuring impairment in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. Loans held for sale are not reported as impaired, as these loans are recorded at either fair value (if we elect the fair value option) or at the lower of cost or fair value. Impaired loans also exclude PCI loans, as these loans are accounted for based on expected cash flows at acquisition because this accounting methodology takes into consideration future credit losses. Loans defined as individually impaired, based on applicable accounting guidance, include larger-balance nonperforming loans and TDR loans. Loans modified in a TDR continue to be reported as impaired until maturity. Our policies for identifying loans as individually impaired, by loan category, are as follows: Credit card loans: Credit card loans that have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring are identified and accounted for as individually impaired. Consumer banking loans: Consumer loans that have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring are identified and accounted for as individually impaired. Commercial banking loans: Commercial loans classified as nonperforming and commercial loans that have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring are reported as individually impaired. The majority of individually impaired loans are evaluated for an asset-specific allowance. We generally measure impairment and the related asset-specific allowance for individually impaired loans based on the difference between the recorded investment of the loan and the present value of the expected future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate of the loan at the time of modification. If the loan is collateral dependent, we measure impairment based upon the fair value of the underlying collateral, which we determine based on the current fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs. Loans are identified as collateral dependent if we believe the collateral will be the primary source of repayment. Charge-Offs We charge off loans as a reduction to the allowance for loan and lease losses when we determine the loan is uncollectible and we record subsequent recoveries of previously charged off amounts as an increase to the allowance for loan and lease losses. We exclude accrued and unpaid finance charges and fees and certain fraud losses from charge-offs. Costs to recover charged-off loans are recorded as collection expense and included in our consolidated statements of income as a component of other non-interest expense as incurred. Our charge-off time frames by loan type are presented below. Credit card loans: We generally charge off credit card loans in the period the account becomes 180 days past due. We charge off delinquent credit card loans for which revolving privileges have been revoked as part of loan workouts when the account becomes 120 days past due. Credit card loans in bankruptcy are generally charged-off by the end of the month following 30 days after the receipt of a complete bankruptcy notification from the bankruptcy court. Credit card loans of deceased account holders are generally charged off 5 days after receipt of notification. Consumer banking loans: We generally charge off consumer banking loans at the earlier of the date when the account is a specified number of days past due or upon repossession of the underlying collateral. Our charge-off period for auto loans is 120 days past due. Small business banking loans generally charge off at 120 days past due based on the date unpaid principal loan amounts are deemed uncollectible. Auto loans that have not been previously charged off where the borrower has filed for bankruptcy and the loan has not been reaffirmed charge off in the period that the loan is 60 days from the bankruptcy notification date, regardless of delinquency status. Auto loans that have not been previously charged off and have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy are charged off at the end of the month in which the bankruptcy discharge occurs. Remaining consumer loans generally are charged off within 40 days of receipt of notification from the bankruptcy court. Consumer loans of deceased account holders are charged off by the end of the month following 60 days of receipt of notification. Commercial banking loans: We charge off commercial loans in the period we determine that the unpaid principal loan amounts are uncollectible. 125 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PCI loans: We do not record charge-offs on PCI loans that are meeting or exceeding our performance expectations as of the date of acquisition, as the fair values of these loans already reflect a discount for expected future credit losses. We record charge-offs on PCI loans only if actual losses exceed estimated credit losses incorporated into the fair value recorded at acquisition. Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses We maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses ( allowance ) that represents management best estimate of incurred loan and lease losses inherent in our loans held for investment portfolio as of each balance sheet date. The provision for credit losses reflects credit losses we believe have been incurred and will eventually be recognized over time in our charge-offs. Charge-offs of uncollectible amounts are deducted from the allowance and subsequent recoveries are added back. Management performs a quarterly analysis of our loan portfolio to determine if impairment has occurred and to assess the adequacy of the allowance based on historical and current trends as well as other factors affecting credit losses. We apply documented systematic methodologies to separately calculate the allowance for our credit card, consumer banking and commercial banking loan portfolios. Our allowance for loan and lease losses consists of three components that are allocated to cover the estimated probable losses in each loan portfolio based on the results of our detailed review and loan impairment assessment process: (i) a component for loans collectively evaluated for impairment; (ii) an asset-specific component for individually impaired loans; and (iii) a component related to PCI loans that have experienced significant decreases in expected cash flows subsequent to acquisition. Each of our allowance components is supplemented by an amount that represents management qualitative judgment of the imprecision and risks inherent in the processes and assumptions used in establishing the allowance. Management judgment involves an assessment of subjective factors, such as process risk, modeling assumption and adjustment risks, and probable internal and external events that will likely impact losses. Our credit card and consumer banking loan portfolios consist of smaller-balance, homogeneous loans. The consumer banking loan portfolio is divided into two primary portfolio segments: auto loans and retail banking loans. The credit card and consumer banking loan portfolios are further divided by our business units into groups based on common risk characteristics, such as origination year, contract type, interest rate, credit bureau score and geography, which are collectively evaluated for impairment. The commercial banking loan portfolio is primarily composed of larger-balance, non-homogeneous loans. These loans are subject to individual reviews that result in internal risk ratings. In assessing the risk rating of a particular loan, among the factors we consider are the financial condition of the borrower, geography, collateral performance, historical loss experience and industry-specific information that management believes is relevant in determining the occurrence of a loss event and measuring impairment. These factors are based on an evaluation of historical and current information, and involve subjective assessment and interpretation. Emphasizing one factor over another or considering additional factors could impact the risk rating assigned to that loan. The component of the allowance related to credit card and consumer banking loans that we collectively evaluate for impairment is based on a statistical calculation, which is supplemented by management judgment as described above. Because of the homogeneous nature of our consumer banking loan portfolios, the allowance is based on the aggregated portfolio segment evaluations. The allowance is established through a process that begins with estimates of incurred losses in each pool based upon various statistical analyses. Loss forecast models are utilized to estimate probable losses incurred and consider several portfolio indicators including, but not limited to, historical loss experience, account seasoning, the value of collateral underlying secured loans, estimated foreclosures or defaults based on observable trends, delinquencies, bankruptcy filings, unemployment, credit bureau scores and general economic and business trends. Management believes these factors are relevant in estimating probable losses incurred and also considers an evaluation of overall portfolio credit quality based on indicators such as changes in our credit evaluation, underwriting and collection management policies, the effect of other external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements, general economic conditions and business trends, and uncertainties in forecasting and modeling techniques used in estimating our allowance. We update our credit card and consumer banking loss forecast models and portfolio indicators on a quarterly basis to incorporate information reflective of the current economic environment. The component of the allowance for commercial banking loans that we collectively evaluate for impairment is based on our historical loss experience for loans with similar risk characteristics and consideration of the current credit quality of the portfolio, which is supplemented by management judgment as described above. We apply internal risk ratings to commercial banking loans, which we use to assess credit quality and derive a total loss estimate based on an estimated probability of default ( default rate ) and loss given default ( loss severity ). Management may also apply judgment to adjust the loss factors derived, taking into consideration both quantitative and qualitative factors, including general economic conditions, industry-specific and geographic 126 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS trends, portfolio concentrations, trends in internal credit quality indicators, and current and past underwriting standards that have occurred but are not yet reflected in the historical data underlying our loss estimates. The asset-specific component of the allowance covers smaller-balance homogeneous credit card and consumer banking loans whose terms have been modified in a TDR and larger-balance nonperforming, non-homogeneous commercial banking loans. As discussed above under Impaired Loans, we generally measure the asset-specific component of the allowance based on the difference between the recorded investment of individually impaired loans and the present value of expected future cash flows. The asset-specific component of the allowance for smaller-balance impaired loans is calculated on a pool basis using historical loss experience for the respective class of assets. The asset-specific component of the allowance for larger-balance impaired loans is individually calculated for each loan. Key considerations in determining the allowance include the borrower overall financial condition, resources and payment history, prospects for support from financially responsible guarantors, and when applicable, the estimated realizable value of any collateral. Applicable accounting guidance prohibits the carry over or creation of valuation allowances in the initial accounting for impaired loans acquired. See Note 3 Loans for information on loan portfolios associated with acquisitions. In addition to the allowance, we also estimate probable losses related to contractually binding unfunded lending commitments. The provision for unfunded lending commitments is included in the provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of income and the related reserve is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Unfunded lending commitments are subject to individual reviews and are analyzed and segregated by risk according to our internal risk rating scale, which we use to assess credit quality and derive a total loss estimate. We assess these risk classifications, taking into consideration both quantitative and qualitative factors, including historical loss experience, utilization assumptions, current economic conditions, performance trends within specific portfolio segments and other pertinent information to estimate the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments in future periods. See Note 4 Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments for additional information. Securitization of Loans Our loan securitization activities primarily involve the securitization of credit card and auto loans, which provides a source of funding for us. See Note 5 Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations for additional details. Loan securitization involves the transfer of a pool of loan receivables from our portfolio to a trust. The trust then sells an undivided interest in the pool of loan receivables to third-party investors through the issuance of debt securities and transfers the proceeds from the debt issuance to us as consideration for the loan receivables transferred. The debt securities are collateralized by the loan receivables transferred from our portfolio. We remove loans from our consolidated balance sheets when securitizations qualify as sales to non-consolidated VIEs, recognize assets retained and liabilities assumed at fair value and record a gain or loss on the transferred loans. Alternatively, when the transfer does not qualify as a sale but instead is considered a secured borrowing, the assets will remain on our consolidated balance sheets with an offsetting liability recognized for the amount of proceeds received. 127 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Premises, Equipment and Leases Premises and Equipment Premises and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Land is carried at cost. We capitalize direct costs incurred during the application development stage of internally developed software projects. Depreciation and amortization expenses are calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Useful lives for premises and equipment are estimated as follows: Premises and Equipment Useful Lives Buildings and improvements 5-39 years Furniture and equipment 3-10 years Computer software 3 years Leasehold improvements Lesser of the useful life or the remaining lease term Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred and gains or losses upon disposition are recognized in our consolidated statements of income as realized. See Note 7 Premises, Equipment and Leases for additional information. Leases Lease classification is determined at inception for all lease transactions with an initial term greater than one year. Operating leases are included as right-of-use ( ROU ) assets within other assets, and operating lease liabilities are classified as other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in premises and equipment, and other borrowings on our consolidated balance sheets. Our operating lease expense is included in occupancy and equipment within non-interest expense in our consolidated statements of income. Lease expense for minimum lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. See Note 7 Premises, Equipment and Leases for additional information. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition price of an acquired business over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and is assigned to one or more reporting units at the date of acquisition. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment, or a business unit that is one level below an operating segment. We have four reporting units: Credit Card, Auto, Other Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or more frequently if adverse circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. These indicators could include a sustained, significant decline in the Company stock price, a decline in expected future cash flows, significant disposition activity, a significant adverse change in the economic or business environment, and the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group, among others. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized on either an accelerated or straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives and are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. See Note 6 Goodwill and Intangible Assets for additional informatio n. Mortgage Servicing Rights Mortgage servicing rights ( MSRs ) are initially recorded at fair value when mortgage loans are sold or securitized in the secondary market and the right to service these loans is retained for a fee. Commercial MSRs are subsequently accounted for under the amortization method. We evaluate for impairment as of each reporting date and recognize any impairment in other non-interest income. See Note 6 Goodwill and Intangible Assets for additional information. Foreclosed Property and Repossessed Assets Foreclosed property and repossessed assets obtained through our lending activities typically include commercial real estate or personal property, such as automobiles, and are recorded at net realizable value. For foreclosed property and repossessed assets, we generally reclassify the loan to repossessed assets upon repossession of the property in satisfaction of the loan. Net realizable 128 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS value is the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less estimated selling costs and is based on appraisals, when available. Subsequent to initial recognition, foreclosed property and repossessed assets are recorded at the lower of our initial cost basis or net realizable value, which is routinely monitored and updated. Any changes in net realizable value and gains or losses realized from disposition of the property are recorded in other non-interest expense. See Note 16 Fair Value Measurement for details. Restricted Equity Investments We have investments in Federal Home Loan Banks ( FHLB ) stock and in the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ( Federal Reserve ) stock. These investments, which are included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets, are not marketable, are carried at cost, and if there is any indicator of impairment are reviewed for impairment. Litigation In accordance with the current accounting standards for loss contingencies, we establish reserves for litigation-related matters, including mortgage representation and warranty related matters, that arise from the ordinary course of our business activities when it is probable that a loss associated with a claim or proceeding has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Professional service fees, including lawyers and experts fees, expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency are expensed as services are provided. See Note 18 Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others for additional information. Customer Rewards Reserve We offer products, primarily credit cards, which include programs that allow members to earn rewards based on account activity that can be redeemed for cash (primarily in the form of statement credits), gift cards, travel, or covering eligible charges. The amount of reward that a customer earns varies based on the terms and conditions of the rewards program and product. When rewards are earned by a customer, rewards expense is generally recorded as an offset to interchange income, with a corresponding increase to the customer rewards reserve. The customer rewards reserve is computed based on the estimated future cost of earned rewards that are expected to be redeemed and is reduced as rewards are redeemed. In estimating the customer rewards reserve, we consider historical redemption and spending behavior, as well as the terms and conditions of the current rewards programs, among other factors. We expect the vast majority of all rewards earned will eventually be redeemed. The customer rewards reserve, which is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, totaled $ 4.7 billion and $ 4.3 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Revenue Recognition Interest Income and Fees Interest income and fees on loans and investment securities are recognized based on the contractual provisions of the underlying arrangements. Loan origination fees and costs and premiums and discounts on loans held for investment are deferred and generally amortized into interest income as yield adjustments over the contractual life and/or commitment period using the effective interest method. Costs deferred include direct origination costs such as bounties paid to third parties for new accounts and incentives paid to our network of auto dealers for loan referrals. In certain circumstances, we elect to factor prepayment estimates into the calculation of the constant effective yield necessary to apply the interest method. Prepayment estimates are based on historical prepayment data, existing and forecasted interest rates, and economic data. For credit card loans, loan origination fees and direct loan origination costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over a 12 -month period. Unamortized premiums, discounts and other basis adjustments on investment securities are recognized in interest income over the contractual lives of the securities using the effective interest method. Finance charges and fees on credit card loans are recorded in revenue when earned. Billed finance charges and fees on credit card loans are included in loan receivables net of amounts that we consider uncollectible. Unbilled finance charges and fees on credit card loans are included in interest receivable on our consolidated balance sheets. Annual membership fees are classified as service charges and other customer-related fees on our consolidated statements of income and are deferred and amortized into income over 12 months on a straight-line basis. We continue to accrue finance charges and fees on credit card loans until the account is 129 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS charged-off. Our methodology for estimating the uncollectible portion of billed finance charges and fees is consistent with the methodology we use to estimate the allowance for incurred principal losses on our credit card loan receivables. Interchange Income Interchange income represents fees for standing ready to authorize and providing settlement on credit and debit card transactions processed through the MasterCard ( MasterCard ) and Visa ( Visa ) interchange networks. The levels and structure of interchange rates are set by MasterCard and Visa and can vary based on cardholder purchase volumes, among other factors. We recognize interchange income upon settlement with the interchange networks. See Note 17 Business Segments and Revenue from Contracts with Customers for additional details. Card Partnership Agreements We have contractual agreements with certain retailers and other partners to provide lending and other services to mutual customers. We primarily issue private-label and cobrand credit card loans to these customers over the term of the partnership agreements, which typically range from two years to ten years . Certain partners assist in or perform marketing activities on our behalf and promote our products and services to their customers. As compensation for providing these services, we often pay royalties, bounties or other special bonuses to these partners. Depending upon the nature of the payments, they are recorded as a reduction of revenue, marketing expenses or other operating expenses. Credit card partnership agreements may also provide for profit or revenue sharing which are presented as a reduction of the related revenue line item when owed to the partner. When a partner agrees to share a portion of the credit losses associated with the partnership, we must determine whether to report the sharing of losses on a gross or net basis in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate the contractual provisions for the loss share payments and applicable accounting guidance to determine how to present the impact of the partnership agreement in our consolidated financial statements. Our consolidated net income is the same regardless of how revenue and loss sharing arrangements are reported. When loss sharing amounts due from partners are presented on a net basis, they are recorded as a reduction to our provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of income and reduce the charge-off amounts that we report. The allowance for loan and lease losses attributable to these portfolios is also reduced by the expected reimbursements from these partners for loss sharing amounts. See Note 4 Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments for additional information related to our loss sharing arrangements. For loss sharing arrangements presented on a gross basis, any loss share payments due from the partner are recorded as a part of revenue, and the allowance for loan and lease losses is not reduced by the expected loss share reimbursements but rather, an indemnification asset is recorded. Collaborative Arrangements A collaborative arrangement is a contractual arrangement that involves a joint operating activity between two or more parties that are active participants in the activity. These parties are exposed to significant risks and rewards based upon the economic success of the joint operating activity. We assess each of our partnership agreements with profit, revenue or loss sharing payments to determine if a collaborative arrangement exists and, if so, how revenue generated from third parties, costs incurred and transactions between participants in the collaborative arrangement should be accounted for and reported on our consolidated financial statements. We currently have one partnership agreement that meets the definition of a collaborative agreement. We share a fixed percentage of revenues, consisting of finance charges and late fees, with the partner, and the partner is required to reimburse us for a fixed percentage of credit losses incurred. Revenues and losses related to the partner credit card program and partnership agreement are reported on a net basis in our consolidated financial statements. Revenue sharing amounts attributable to the partner are recorded as an offset against total net revenue in our consolidated statements of income. Interest income was reduced by $ 1.0 billion , $ 1.3 billion and $ 1.2 billion in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively, for amounts earned by the partner, as part of the partnership agreement. The impact of all of our loss sharing arrangements that are presented on a net basis is included in Note 4 Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments . 130 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Stock-Based Compensation We are authorized to issue stock based compensation to employees and directors in various forms, primarily as restricted stock units, performance share units, and stock options. In addition, we also issue cash equity units and cash-settled restricted stock units which are not counted against the common shares reserved for issuance or available for issuance because they are settled in cash. For awards settled in shares, we generally recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the award requisite service period based on the fair value of the award at the grant date. If an award settled in shares contains a performance condition with graded vesting, we recognize compensation expense using the accelerated attribution method. Equity units and restricted stock units that are cash-settled are accounted for as liability awards which results in quarterly expense fluctuations based on changes in our stock price through the date that the awards are settled. Awards that continue to vest after retirement are expensed over the shorter of the time period between the grant date and the final vesting period or between the grant date and when the participant becomes retirement eligible. Awards to participants who are retirement eligible at the grant date are subject to immediate expense recognition. Stock-based compensation expense is included in salaries and associate benefits in the consolidated statements of income. Stock-based compensation expense for equity classified stock options is based on the grant date fair value, which is estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Significant judgment is required when determining the inputs into the fair value model. For awards other than stock options, the fair value of stock-based compensation used in determining compensation expense will generally equal the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. Certain share-settled awards have discretionary vesting conditions which result in the remeasurement of these awards at fair value each reporting period and the potential for compensation expense to fluctuate with changes in our stock price. See Note 13 Stock-Based Compensation Plans for additional details. Marketing Expenses Marketing expense includes the cost of our various promotional efforts to attract and retain customers such as advertising, promotional materials, and certain customer incentives. We expense marketing costs as incurred. Income Taxes We recognize the current and deferred tax consequences of all transactions that have been recognized in the financial statements using the provisions of the enacted tax laws. Current income tax expense represents our estimated taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period and includes income tax expense related to our uncertain tax positions, as well as tax-related interest and penalties. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. We record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We record the effect of remeasuring deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates or laws as a component of income tax expense related to continuing operations for the period in which the change is enacted. We subsequently release income tax effects stranded in AOCI using a portfolio approach. Income tax benefits are recognized when, based on their technical merits, they are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. The amount recognized is the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. See Note 15 Income Taxes for additional details. Earnings Per Share Earnings per share is calculated and reported under the two-class method. The two-class method is an earnings allocation method under which earnings per share is calculated for each class of common stock and participating security considering both dividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings as if all such earnings had been distributed during the period. We have unvested share-based payment awards which have a right to receive nonforfeitable dividends. These share-based payment awards are deemed to be participating securities. We calculate basic earnings per share by dividing net income, after deducting dividends on preferred stock and participating securities as well as undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities, by the average number of common shares outstanding during the period, net of any treasury shares. We calculate diluted earnings per share in a similar manner after consideration of the potential dilutive effect of common stock equivalents on the average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Common stock equivalents include warrants, stock options, restricted stock awards and units, and performance 131 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS share awards and units. Common stock equivalents are calculated based upon the treasury stock method using an average market price of common shares during the period. Dilution is not considered when a net loss is reported. Common stock equivalents that have an antidilutive effect are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share. See Note 12 Earnings Per Common Share for additional details. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities All derivative financial instruments, whether designated for hedge accounting or not, are reported at their fair value on our consolidated balance sheets as either assets or liabilities, with consideration of legally enforceable master netting arrangements that allow us to net settle positive and negative positions and offset cash collateral with the same counterparty. We report net derivatives in a gain position, or derivative assets, on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other assets. We report net derivatives in a loss position, or derivative liabilities, on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other liabilities. See Note 9 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities for additional details. Fair Value Fair value, also referred to as an exit price, is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The fair value accounting guidance provides a three-level fair value hierarchy for classifying financial instruments. This hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable. Fair value measurement of a financial asset or liability is assigned to a level based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: Level 1: Valuation is based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Valuation is based on observable market-based inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3: Valuation is generated from techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. Valuation techniques include pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques. The accounting guidance for fair value requires that we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in determining fair value. The accounting guidance also provides for the irrevocable option to elect, on a contract-by-contract basis, to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value at inception of the contract and record any subsequent changes to fair value in the consolidated statements of income. See Note 16 Fair Value Measurement for additional information. Accounting for Acquisitions We account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method, tangible and intangible identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date, with limited exceptions. Transaction costs and costs to restructure the acquired company are expensed as incurred. Goodwill is recognized as the excess of the acquisition price over the estimated fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Likewise, if the fair value of the net assets acquired is greater than the acquisition price, a bargain purchase gain is recognized and recorded in other non-interest income. If the acquired set of activities and assets do not meet the accounting definition of a business, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition. In an asset acquisition, the assets acquired are recorded at the purchase price plus any transaction costs incurred and no goodwill is recognized. 132 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Accounting Standards Adopted During the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2019 Standard Guidance Adoption Timing and Financial Statements Impacts Codification Improvements Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments Topic 3: Codification Improvements to Update 2017-12 and Other Hedging Items Issued April 2019 Clarifies the measurement of the hedged item in fair value hedges of interest rate risk in partial-term fair value hedges and the treatment of the basis adjustments. We early adopted Topic 3 of this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2019 and applied the amendments retrospectively as of January 1, 2018 (the date we initially applied ASU No. 2017-12). Our adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Premium Amortization on Callable Debt Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-08, Receivables Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic 310-20): Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities Issued March 2017 Shortens the amortization period from the contractual life to the earliest call date for certain purchased callable debt securities held at a premium. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2019 using the modified retrospective method of adoption. Our adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Leases ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) Issued February 2016 Requires lessees to recognize right of use assets and lease liabilities on their consolidated balance sheets and disclose key information about all their leasing arrangements, with certain practical expedients. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2019, using the modified retrospective method of adoption without restating prior periods. We elected the practical expedients that permitted us to not reassess the lease classification of existing leases, whether existing contracts contain a lease or the treatment of initial direct costs on existing leases. Upon adoption, we recorded a lease liability of $1.9 billion and right of use asset of $1.6 billion, which is net of other lease-related balances. 133 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 2 INVESTMENT SECURITIES Our investment securities portfolio consists primarily of the following: U.S. Treasury securities; U.S. government-sponsored enterprise or agency ( Agency ) and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities ( RMBS ); Agency commercial mortgage-backed securities ( CMBS ); and other securities. Agency securities include Government National Mortgage Association ( Ginnie Mae ) guaranteed securities, Federal National Mortgage Association ( Fannie Mae ) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( Freddie Mac ) issued securities. The carrying value of our investments in U.S. Treasury and Agency securities represented 96 % of our total investment securities portfolio as of both December 31, 2019 and 2018 . On December 31, 2019, we transferred our entire portfolio of held to maturity securities to available for sale in consideration of changes to regulatory capital requirements under the Tailoring Rules, which no longer required us to include in regulatory capital certain elements of AOCI, including unrealized gains and losses from available for sale securities. On the date of transfer, these securities had a fair value of $ 33.2 billion , including pre-tax unrealized gains of $ 1.2 billion .

Because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay certain obligations, the expected maturities of our securities are likely to differ from the scheduled contractual maturities presented below. The weighted-average yield below represents the effective yield for the investment securities and is calculated based on the amortized cost of each security.

Other-Than-Temporary Impairment We evaluate all securities in an unrealized loss position at least quarterly, and more often as market conditions require, to assess whether the impairment is other-than-temporary. Our OTTI assessment is based on a discounted cash flow analysis which requires careful use of judgments and assumptions. A number of qualitative and quantitative criteria may be considered in our assessment, as applicable, including the size and the nature of the portfolio; historical and projected performance such as prepayment, default and loss severity for the RMBS portfolio; recent credit events specific to the issuer and/or industry to which the issuer belongs; the payment structure of the security; external credit ratings of the issuer and any failure or delay of the issuer to make scheduled interest or principal payments; the value of underlying collateral; our intent and ability to hold the security; and current and projected market and macro-economic conditions. If we intend to sell a security in an unrealized loss position or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, the entire difference between the amortized cost basis of the security and its fair value is recognized in earnings. As of December 31, 2019 , we had sold all securities previously designated with the intent to sell, and did not intend to sell, nor believe that we will be required to sell, any other security in an unrealized loss position prior to the recovery of its amortized cost basis. For those securities that we do not intend to sell nor expect to be required to sell, an analysis is performed to determine if any of the impairment is due to credit-related factors or whether it is due to other factors, such as interest rates. Credit-related impairment is recognized in earnings, with the remaining unrealized non-credit-related impairment recorded in AOCI. We determine the credit component based on the difference between the security amortized cost basis and the present value of its expected cash flows, discounted at the security effective yield. 136 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Realized Gains and Losses on Securities and OTTI Recognized in Earnings The following table presents the gross realized gains or losses and proceeds from the sale of securities available for sale for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 .

We discuss these risks and our credit quality indicator for each portfolio segment below. Credit Card Our credit card loan portfolio is highly diversified across millions of accounts and numerous geographies without significant individual exposure. We therefore generally manage credit risk based on portfolios with common risk characteristics. The risk in our credit card loan portfolio correlates to broad economic trends, such as unemployment rates and home values, as well as consumers financial condition, all of which can have a material effect on credit performance. The key indicator we assess in monitoring the credit quality and risk of our credit card loan portfolio is delinquency trends, including an analysis of loan migration between delinquency categories over time. Table 3.1 details delinquency trends for our loan portfolios as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 . Consumer Banking Our consumer banking loan portfolio consists of auto and retail banking loans. Similar to our credit card loan portfolio, the risk in our consumer banking loan portfolio correlates to broad economic trends, such as unemployment rates, gross domestic product and home values, as well as consumers financial condition, all of which can have a material effect on credit performance. The key indicator we monitor when assessing the credit quality and risk of our auto loan portfolio is borrower credit scores as they measure the creditworthiness of borrowers. Delinquency trends are the key indicator we assess in monitoring the credit quality and risk of our retail banking loan portfolio. Table 3.1 details delinquency trends for our loan portfolios as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. The table below provides details on the credit scores of our auto loan portfolio as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 . Table 3.3 : Auto Loan Credit Score Distribution - At Origination FICO Scores (1) (Dollars in millions) December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Greater than 660 $ 28,773 $ 27,913 621 - 660 11,924 10,729 620 or below 19,665 17,699 Total $ 60,362 $ 56,341 __________ (1) Amounts represent period-end loans held for investment in each credit score category. Auto credit scores generally represent average FICO scores obtained from three credit bureaus at the time of application and are not refreshed thereafter. Balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 620 or below category. Commercial Banking We evaluate the credit risk of commercial banking loans using a risk rating system. We assign internal risk ratings to loans based on relevant information about the ability of the borrowers to repay their debt. In determining the risk rating of a particular loan, some of the factors considered are the borrower current financial condition, historical and projected future credit performance, prospects for support from financially responsible guarantors, the estimated realizable value of any collateral and current economic trends. The scale based on our internal risk rating system is as follows: Noncriticized: Loans that have not been designated as criticized, frequently referred to as pass loans. Criticized performing: Loans in which the financial condition of the obligor is stressed, affecting earnings, cash flows or collateral values. The borrower currently has adequate capacity to meet near-term obligations; however, the stress, left unabated, may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects at some future date. Criticized nonperforming: Loans that are not adequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or the collateral pledged, if any. Loans classified as criticized nonperforming have a well-defined weakness, or 141 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS weaknesses, which jeopardize the full repayment of the debt. These loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain a credit loss if the deficiencies are not corrected and are generally placed on nonaccrual status. We use our internal risk rating system for regulatory reporting, determining the frequency of credit exposure reviews, and evaluating and determining the allowance for loan and lease losses for commercial loans. Generally, loans that are designated as criticized performing and criticized nonperforming are reviewed quarterly by management to determine if they are appropriately classified/rated and whether any impairment exists. Noncriticized loans are also generally reviewed, at least annually, to determine the appropriate risk rating. In addition, we evaluate the risk rating during the renewal process of any loan or if a loan becomes past due. The following table presents the internal risk ratings of our commercial banking loan portfolio as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 .

Impaired Loans The following table presents information on our impaired loans as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , and for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 . Impaired loans include loans modified in troubled debt restructurings ( TDRs ), all nonperforming commercial loans and nonperforming home loans with a specific impairment. Impaired loans without an allowance generally represent loans that have been charged down to the fair value of the underlying collateral for which we believe no additional losses have been incurred, or where the fair value of the underlying collateral meets or exceeds the loan amortized cost.

We also pledged loan collateral of $ 6.7 billion and $ 9.2 billion to secure our Federal Reserve Discount Window borrowing capacity of $ 5.3 billion and $ 7.6 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. In addition to loans pledged, we securitized a portion of our credit card and auto loans. See Note 5 Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations for additional information. Finance Charge and Fee Reserve We continue to accrue finance charges and fees on credit card loans until the account is charged off. Our methodology for estimating the uncollectible portion of billed finance charges and fees is consistent with the methodology we use to estimate the allowance for incurred principal losses on our credit card loan receivables. Total net revenue was reduced by $ 1.4 billion , $ 1.3 billion and $ 1.4 billion in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively, for the estimated uncollectible amount of billed finance charges and fees, and related losses. The finance charge and fee reserve, which is recorded as a contra asset on our consolidated balance sheets, totaled $ 462 million and $ 468 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Loans Held for Sale Our total loans held for sale was $ 400 million and $ 1.2 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. We originated for sale $ 9.0 billion and $ 8.7 billion of commercial multifamily real estate loans in 2019 and 2018 , respectively, and $ 8.4 billion of conforming residential mortgage loans and commercial multifamily real estate loans in 2017 . We retained servicing on all of multifamily real estate loans. 147 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 4 ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES AND RESERVE FOR UNFUNDED LENDING COMMITMENTS Our allowance for loan and lease losses represents management best estimate of incurred loan and lease losses inherent in our loans held for investment as of each balance sheet date. In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we also estimate probable losses related to contractually binding unfunded lending commitments. The provision for losses on unfunded lending commitments is included in the provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of income and the related reserve for unfunded lending commitments is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further discussion of our methodology and policy for determining our allowance for loan and lease losses for each of our loan portfolio segments, as well as information on our reserve for unfunded lending commitments. Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments Activity The table below summarizes changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments by portfolio segment for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 .

Credit Card Partnership Loss Sharing Arrangements We have certain credit card partnership agreements that are presented within our consolidated financial statements on a net basis, in which our partner agrees to share a portion of the credit losses on the underlying loan portfolio. The expected reimbursements from these partners, which are netted against our allowance for loan and lease losses, result in reductions to net charge-offs and provision for credit losses. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further discussion of our credit card partnership agreements. The table below summarizes the changes in the estimated reimbursements from these partners for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 . The 2019 amounts below include the impacts of our loss sharing arrangement on the acquired Walmart portfolio.

Our primary involvement with VIEs has been related to our securitization transactions in which we transferred assets to securitization trusts. We have primarily securitized credit card and auto loans, which have provided a source of funding for us and enabled us to transfer a certain portion of the economic risk of the loans or related debt securities to third parties. The entity that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is referred to as the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the VIE. The majority of the VIEs in which we are involved have been consolidated in our financial statements. Summary of Consolidated and Unconsolidated VIEs The assets of our consolidated VIEs primarily consist of cash, loan receivables and the related allowance for loan and lease losses, which we report on our consolidated balance sheets under restricted cash for securitization investors, loans held in consolidated trusts and allowance for loan and lease losses, respectively. The assets of a particular VIE are the primary source of funds to settle its obligations. Creditors of these VIEs typically do not have recourse to our general credit. Liabilities primarily consist of debt securities issued by the VIEs, which we report under securitized debt obligations on our consolidated balance sheets. For unconsolidated VIEs, we present the carrying amount of assets and liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheets and our maximum exposure to loss. Our maximum exposure to loss is estimated based on the unlikely event that all of the assets in the VIEs become worthless and we are required to meet our maximum remaining funding obligations. The tables below present a summary of VIEs in which we had continuing involvement or held a variable interest, aggregated based on VIEs with similar characteristics as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 . We separately present information for consolidated and unconsolidated VIEs.

(2) In certain investment structures, we consolidate a VIE which in turn holds as its primary asset an investment in an unconsolidated VIE. In these instances, we disclose the carrying amount of assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as unconsolidated VIEs to avoid duplicating our exposure, as the unconsolidated VIEs are generally the operating entities generating the exposure. The carrying amount of assets and liabilities included in the unconsolidated VIE columns above related to these investment structures were $ 2.3 billion of assets and $ 741 million of liabilities as of December 31, 2019 , and $ 2.3 billion of assets and $ 811 million of liabilities as of December 31, 2018 . Securitization-Related VIEs In a securitization transaction, assets are transferred to a trust, which generally meets the definition of a VIE. We engage in securitization activities as an issuer and an investor. Our primary securitization issuance activity includes credit card and auto securitizations, conducted through securitization trusts which we consolidate. Our continuing involvement in these securitization transactions mainly consists of acting as the primary servicer and holding certain retained interests. In our multifamily agency business, we originate multifamily commercial real estate loans and transfer them to securitization trusts of government-sponsored enterprises ( GSEs ). We retain the related MSRs and service the transferred loans pursuant to the guidelines set forth by the GSEs. As an investor, we hold RMBS and CMBS in our investment securities portfolio, which represent variable interests in the respective securitization trusts from which those securities were issued. We do not consolidate the securitization trusts employed in these transactions as we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these securitization trusts. Our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with these VIEs is the carrying value of MSRs and investment securities on our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 6 Goodwill and Intangible Assets for information related to our MSRs associated with these securitizations and Note 2 Investment Securities for more information on the securities held in our investment securities portfolio. We exclude these VIEs from the tables within this note because we do not consider our continuing involvement with these VIEs to be significant as we either invest in securities issued by the VIE and were not involved in the design of the VIE or no transfers have occurred between the VIE and us. In addition, where we have certain lending arrangements in the normal course of business with entities that could be VIEs, we have also excluded these VIEs from the tables presented in this note. See Note 3 Loans for additional information regarding our lending arrangements in the normal course of business. 152 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The table below presents our continuing involvement in certain securitization-related VIEs as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 . Table 5.2 : Continuing Involvement in Securitization-Related VIEs (Dollars in millions) Credit Card Auto Mortgages December 31, 2019: Securities held by third-party investors $ 15,798 $ 2,010 $ 962 Receivables in the trust 31,625 2,192 978 Cash balance of spread or reserve accounts 0 7 17 Retained interests Yes Yes Yes Servicing retained Yes Yes No December 31, 2018: Securities held by third-party investors $ 18,307 N/A $ 1,276 Receivables in the trust 34,197 N/A 1,305 Cash balance of spread or reserve accounts 0 N/A 116 Retained interests Yes N/A Yes Servicing retained Yes N/A Yes (1) __________ (1) We previously retained servicing on a portion of our remaining mortgage loans in mortgage securitizations. During 2019, we sold our entire portfolio of retained mortgage servicing rights. Credit Card Securitizations We securitize a portion of our credit card loans which provides a source of funding for us. Credit card securitizations involve the transfer of credit card receivables to securitization trusts. These trusts then issue debt securities collateralized by the transferred receivables to third-party investors. We hold certain retained interests in our credit card securitizations and continue to service the receivables in these trusts. We consolidate these trusts because we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary as we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts, and the right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the trusts. Auto Securitizations Similar to our credit card securitizations, we securitize a portion of our auto loans which provides a source of funding for us. Auto securitization involves the transfer of auto loans to securitization trusts. These trusts then issue debt securities collateralized by the transferred loans to third-party investors. We hold certain retained interests and continue to service the loans in these trusts. We consolidate these trusts because we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary as we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts, and the right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the trusts. Mortgage Securitizations We had previously securitized mortgage loans by transferring these loans to securitization trusts that had issued mortgage-backed securities to investors. These mortgage trusts consist of option-adjustable rate mortgage ( option-ARM ) securitizations and securitizations from our discontinued operations which include the mortgage origination operations of our wholesale mortgage banking unit, GreenPoint Mortgage Funding, Inc. ( GreenPoint ) and the manufactured housing operations of GreenPoint Credit, LLC, a subsidiary of GreenPoint (collectively GreenPoint securitizations ). We retain rights to certain future cash flows arising from these securitizations. We do not consolidate the mortgage securitizations because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts, and the right to receive the benefits or the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the trusts. 153 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Other VIEs Affordable Housing Entities As part of our community reinvestment initiatives, we invest in private investment funds that make equity investments in multifamily affordable housing properties. We receive affordable housing tax credits for these investments. The activities of these entities are financed with a combination of invested equity capital and debt. We account for certain of our investments in qualified affordable housing projects using the proportional amortization method if certain criteria are met. The proportional amortization method amortizes the cost of the investment over the period in which the investor expects to receive tax credits and other tax benefits, and the resulting amortization is recognized as a component of income tax expense attributable to continuing operations. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , we recognized amortization of $ 554 million and $ 477 million , respectively, and tax credits of $ 610 million and $ 529 million , respectively, associated with these investments within income tax provision. The carrying value of our equity investments in these qualified affordable housing projects was $ 4.4 billion and $ 4.2 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. We are periodically required to provide additional financial or other support during the period of the investments. Our liability for these unfunded commitments was $ 1.5 billion as of both December 31, 2019 and 2018 , and is largely expected to be paid from 2020 to 2022 . For those investment funds considered to be VIEs, we are not required to consolidate them if we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of those entities. We record our interests in these unconsolidated VIEs in loans held for investment, other assets and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Our maximum exposure to these entities is limited to our variable interests in the entities which consisted of assets of approximately $ 4.6 billion and $ 4.2 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The creditors of the VIEs have no recourse to our general credit and we do not provide additional financial or other support other than during the period that we are contractually required to provide it. The total assets of the unconsolidated VIE investment funds were approximately $ 10.9 billion and $ 10.8 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Entities that Provide Capital to Low-Income and Rural Communities We hold variable interests in entities ( Investor Entities ) that invest in community development entities ( CDEs ) that provide debt financing to businesses and non-profit entities in low-income and rural communities. Variable interests in the CDEs held by the consolidated Investor Entities are also our variable interests. The activities of the Investor Entities are financed with a combination of invested equity capital and debt. The activities of the CDEs are financed solely with invested equity capital. We receive federal and state tax credits for these investments. We consolidate the VIEs in which we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE economic performance and where we have the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to the VIE. We have also consolidated other investments and CDEs that are not considered to be VIEs, but where we hold a controlling financial interest. The assets of the VIEs that we consolidated, which totaled approximately $ 1.9 billion and $ 1.7 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets in cash, loans held for investment, and other assets. The liabilities are reflected in other liabilities. The creditors of the VIEs have no recourse to our general credit. We have not provided additional financial or other support other than during the period that we are contractually required to provide it. Other Other VIEs include variable interests that we hold in companies that promote renewable energy sources and other equity method investments. We were not required to consolidate these entities because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact their economic performance. Our maximum exposure to these entities is limited to the investment on our consolidated balance sheets of $ 502 million and $ 353 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The creditors of the other VIEs have no recourse to our general credit. We have not provided additional financial or other support other than during the period that we are contractually required to provide it. 154 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 6 GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS The table below presents our goodwill, intangible assets and MSRs as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 .

The goodwill impairment test, performed as of October 1 of each year, is a two-step test. The first step identifies whether there is potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the second step of the impairment test is required to measure the amount of any potential impairment loss. The fair value of reporting units is calculated using a discounted cash flow methodology, a form of the income approach. The calculation uses projected cash flows based on each reporting unit internal forecast and uses the perpetuity growth method to calculate terminal values. These cash flows and terminal values are then discounted using appropriate discount rates, which are largely based on our external cost of equity with adjustments for risk inherent in each reporting unit. Cash flows are adjusted, as necessary, in order to maintain each reporting unit equity capital requirements. Our discounted cash flow analysis requires management to make judgments about future loan and deposit growth, revenue growth, credit losses, and capital rates. The key inputs into the discounted cash flow analysis were consistent with market data, where available, indicating that assumptions used were within a reasonable range of observable market data. Intangible Assets In connection with our acquisitions, we recorded intangible assets including PCCRs, sponsorships, customer and merchant relationships, partnerships, trade names and other contract intangibles. At acquisition, the PCCRs reflect the estimated value of existing credit card holder relationships. 156 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Intangible assets are typically amortized over their respective estimated useful lives on either an accelerated or straight-line basis.

Leases In the first quarter of 2019, we adopted ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for the impacts upon adoption. Our primary involvement with leases is in the capacity as a lessee where we lease premises to support our business. A majority of our leases are operating leases of office space, retail bank branches and Caf s. For real estate leases, we have elected to account for the lease and non-lease components together as a single lease component. Our operating leases expire at various dates through 2071 , and many of them require variable lease payments by us, of property taxes, insurance premiums, common area maintenance and other costs. Certain of these leases also have extension or termination options, and we assess the likelihood of exercising such options. If it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the options, then we include the impact in the measurement of our right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Our right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for operating leases are included in other assets and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. As most of our operating leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments. Our operating lease expense is included in occupancy and equipment within non-interest expense in our consolidated statements of income. Total operating lease expense consists of operating lease cost, which is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and variable lease cost, which is recognized based on actual amounts incurred. We also sublease certain premises, and sublease income is included in other non-interest income in our consolidated statements of income. The following tables present information about our operating lease portfolio and the related lease costs as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 . Table 7.2 Operating Lease Portfolio (Dollars in millions) December 31, 2019 Right-of-use assets $ 1,433 Lease liabilities 1,756 Weighted-average remaining lease term 8.9 years Weighted-average discount rate 3.3 % 158 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Table 7.3 Total Operating Lease Expense and Other Information (Dollars in millions) Year Ended December 31, 2019 Operating lease cost $ 316 Variable lease cost 39 Total lease cost 355 Sublease income ( 26 ) Net lease cost $ 329 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities $ 328 Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities 112 Right-of-use assets recognized upon adoption of new lease standard 1,601 The following table presents a maturity analysis of our operating leases and a reconciliation of the undiscounted cash flows to our lease liabilities as of December 31, 2019 .

These right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are included in premises and equipment, net and other borrowings, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets. We recognized $ 27 million of total finance lease expense for the year ended 2019 . 159 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 8 DEPOSITS AND BORROWINGS Our deposits represent our largest source of funding for our assets and operations, which include checking accounts, money market deposits, negotiable order of withdrawals, savings deposits and time deposits. We also use a variety of other funding sources including short-term borrowings, senior and subordinated notes, securitized debt obligations and other borrowings. In addition, we utilize FHLB advances, which are secured by certain portions of our loan and investment securities portfolios. Securitized debt obligations are presented separately on our consolidated balance sheets, as they represent obligations of consolidated securitization trusts, while federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, senior and subordinated notes and other borrowings, including FHLB advances, are included in other debt on our consolidated balance sheets. Our total short-term borrowings generally consist of federal funds purchased, securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, and short-term FHLB advances. Our long-term debt consists of borrowings with an original contractual maturity of greater than one year. The following tables summarize the components of our deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 . The carrying value presented below for these borrowings includes unamortized debt premiums and discounts, net of debt issuance costs and fair value hedge accounting adjustments.

Our primary market risks stem from the impact on our earnings and economic value of equity due to changes in interest rates and, to a lesser extent, changes in foreign exchange rates. We manage our interest rate sensitivity by employing several techniques, which include changing the duration and re-pricing characteristics of various assets and liabilities by using interest rate derivatives. We also use foreign currency derivatives to limit our earnings and capital exposures to foreign exchange risk by hedging exposures denominated in foreign currencies. In addition to interest rate and foreign currency derivatives, we may also use a variety of other derivative instruments, including caps, floors, options, futures and forward contracts, to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risks. We designate these risk management derivatives as either qualifying accounting hedges or free-standing derivatives. Qualifying accounting hedges are further designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges. Free-standing derivatives are economic hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting. We also offer various interest rate, commodity and foreign currency derivatives as accommodation to our customers within our Commercial Banking business. We enter into these derivatives with our customers primarily to help them manage their interest rate risks, hedge their energy and other commodities exposures, and manage foreign currency fluctuations. We then enter into offsetting derivative contracts with counterparties to economically hedge the majority of our subsequent exposures. See below for additional information on our use of derivatives and how we account for them: Fair Value Hedges: We designate derivatives as fair value hedges when they are used to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities, which fluctuate in value as a result of movements in interest rates. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are presented in the same line item on our consolidated statements of income as the earnings effect of the hedged items. Our fair value hedges primarily consist of interest rate swaps that are intended to modify our exposure to interest rate risk on various fixed-rate financial assets and liabilities. Cash Flow Hedges: We designate derivatives as cash flow hedges when they are used to manage our exposure to variability in cash flows related to forecasted transactions. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of AOCI. Those amounts are reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the forecasted transactions impact earnings and presented in the same line item on our consolidated statements of income as the earnings effect of the hedged items. Our cash flow hedges use interest rate swaps and floors that are intended to hedge the variability in interest receipts or interest payments on some of our variable-rate financial assets or liabilities. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our exposure to variability in cash flows related to intercompany borrowings denominated in foreign currencies. Net Investment Hedges: We use net investment hedges to manage the foreign currency exposure related to our net investments in foreign operations that have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in the fair value of net investment hedges are recorded in the translation adjustment component of AOCI, offsetting the translation gain or loss from those foreign operations. We execute net investment hedges using foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the translation exposure of the net investment in our foreign operations under the forward method. Free-Standing Derivatives: Our free-standing derivatives primarily consist of our customer accommodation derivatives and other economic hedges. The customer accommodation derivatives and the related offsetting contracts are mainly interest rate, commodity and foreign currency contracts. The other free-standing derivatives are primarily used to economically hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of our commercial mortgage loan origination and purchase commitments as well as other interests held. Changes in the fair value of free-standing derivatives are recorded in earnings as a component of other non-interest income. 162 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Derivatives Counterparty Credit Risk Counterparty Types Derivative instruments contain an element of credit risk that arises from the potential failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of the contract, including making payments due upon maturity of certain derivative instruments. We execute our derivative contracts primarily in over-the-counter ( OTC ) markets. We also execute minimal amounts of interest rate and commodity futures in the exchange-traded derivative markets. Our OTC derivatives consist of both centrally cleared and uncleared bilateral contracts. In our centrally cleared contracts, our counterparties are central counterparty clearinghouses ( CCPs ), such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ( CME ) and the LCH Group ( LCH ). In our uncleared bilateral contracts, we enter into agreements directly with our derivative counterparties. Counterparty Credit Risk Management We manage the counterparty credit risk associated with derivative instruments by entering into legally enforceable master netting arrangements, where possible, and exchanging collateral with our counterparties, typically in the form of cash or high-quality liquid securities. The amount of collateral exchanged is dependent upon the fair value of the derivative instruments as well as the fair value of the pledged collateral. When valuing collateral, an estimate of the variation in price and liquidity over time is subtracted in the form of a haircut to discount the value of the collateral pledged. Our exposure to derivative counterparty credit risk, at any point in time, is equal to the amount reported as a derivative asset on our balance sheet. The fair value of our derivatives is adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and any associated cash collateral received or pledged. See Table 9.3 for our net exposure associated with derivatives. The terms under which we collateralize our exposures differ between cleared exposures and uncleared bilateral exposures. CCPs : We clear eligible OTC derivatives with CCPs as part of our regulatory requirements. Futures commission merchants ( FCMs ) serve as the intermediary between CCPs and us. CCPs require that we post initial and variation margin through our FCMs to mitigate the risk of non-payment or default. Initial margin is required upfront by CCPs as collateral against potential losses on our cleared derivative contracts and variation margin is exchanged on a daily basis to account for mark-to-market changes in those derivative contracts. For CME and LCH-cleared OTC derivatives, we characterize variation margin cash payments as settlements. Our FCM agreements governing these derivative transactions include provisions that may require us to post additional collateral under certain circumstances. Bilateral Counterparties : We enter into legally enforceable master netting agreements and collateral agreements, where possible, with bilateral derivative counterparties to mitigate the risk of default. We review our collateral positions on a daily basis and exchange collateral with our counterparties in accordance with these agreements. These bilateral agreements typically provide the right to offset exposure with the same counterparty and require the party in a net liability position to post collateral. Agreements with certain bilateral counterparties require both parties to maintain collateral in the event the fair values of derivative instruments exceed established exposure thresholds. Certain of these bilateral agreements include provisions requiring that our debt maintain a credit rating of investment grade or above by each of the major credit rating agencies. In the event of a downgrade of our debt credit rating below investment grade, some of our counterparties would have the right to terminate their derivative contract and close out existing positions. Credit Risk Valuation Adjustments We record counterparty credit valuation adjustments ( CVAs ) on our derivative assets to reflect the credit quality of our counterparties. We consider collateral and legally enforceable master netting agreements that mitigate our credit exposure to each counterparty in determining CVAs, which may be adjusted in future periods due to changes in the fair values of the derivative contracts, collateral, and creditworthiness of the counterparty. We also record debit valuation adjustments ( DVAs ) to adjust the fair values of our derivative liabilities to reflect the impact of our own credit quality. 163 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Balance Sheet Presentation The following table summarizes the notional amounts and fair values of our derivative instruments as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , which are segregated by derivatives that are designated as accounting hedges and those that are not, and are further segregated by type of contract within those two categories. The total derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and any associated cash collateral received or pledged.

(2) Carrying value represents amortized cost. Balance Sheet Offsetting of Financial Assets and Liabilities Derivative contracts and repurchase agreements that we execute bilaterally in the OTC market are generally governed by enforceable master netting arrangements where we generally have the right to offset exposure with the same counterparty. Either counterparty can generally request to net settle all contracts through a single payment upon default on, or termination of, any one contract. We elect to offset the derivative assets and liabilities under netting arrangements for balance sheet presentation where a right of setoff exists. For derivative contracts entered into under master netting arrangements for which we have not been able to confirm the enforceability of the setoff rights, or those not subject to master netting arrangements, we do not offset our derivative positions for balance sheet presentation. 165 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The following table presents the gross and net fair values of our derivative assets, derivative liabilities, resale and repurchase agreements and the related offsetting amounts permitted under U.S. GAAP as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 . The table also includes cash and non-cash collateral received or pledged in accordance with such arrangements. The amount of collateral presented, however, is limited to the amount of the related net derivative fair values or outstanding balances; therefore, instances of over-collateralization are excluded.

Moreover, the Banks, as insured depository institutions, are subject to prompt corrective action ( PCA ) capital regulations, which require the Federal Banking Agencies to take prompt corrective action for banks that do not meet PCA capital requirements. We entered parallel run under the Basel III Advanced Approaches on January 1, 2015, during which we calculated capital ratios under both the Basel III Standardized Approach and the Basel III Advanced Approaches, though we continued to use the Standardized Approach for purposes of meeting regulatory capital requirements. In October 2019, the Federal Banking Agencies amended the Basel III Capital Rule to provide for tailored application of certain capital requirements across different categories of banking institutions ( Tailoring Rules ). As a bank holding company ( BHC ) with total consolidated assets of at least $250 billion that does not exceed any of the applicable risk-based thresholds, we are a Category III institution under the Tailoring Rules. As such, we are no longer subject to the Basel III Advanced Approaches and certain associated capital requirements, such as the requirement to include in regulatory capital certain elements of AOCI. Under the Basel III Capital Rule, our regulatory minimum risk-based and leverage capital requirements include a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 4.5% , a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6.0% , a total capital ratio of at least 8.0% , a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 4.0% , and a supplementary leverage ratio of 3.0% . For additional information about the capital adequacy guidelines we are subject to, see Part I Item 1. Business Supervision and Regulation . 174 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The following table provides a comparison of our regulatory capital amounts and ratios under the Basel III Standardized Approach subject to the applicable transition provisions, the regulatory minimum capital adequacy ratios and the PCA well-capitalized level for each ratio,where applicable, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 .

Regulatory restrictions exist that limit the ability of the Banks to transfer funds to our BHC. As of December 31, 2019 , funds available for dividend payments from COBNA and CONA were $ 3.3 billion and $ 4.7 billion , respectively. Applicable provisions that may be contained in our borrowing agreements or the borrowing agreements of our subsidiaries may limit our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends to us or our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. The Federal Reserve requires depository institutions to maintain certain cash reserves against specified deposit liabilities.

As of December 31, 2019 , under the Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive plan ( 2004 Plan ), we are authorized to issue 55 million common shares in various forms, primarily share-settled restricted stock units ( RSUs ), performance share units ( PSUs ), and non-qualified stock options. Of this amount, approximately 10 million shares remain available for future issuance as of December 31, 2019 . The 2004 Plan permits the use of newly issued shares or treasury shares upon the settlement of options and stock-based incentive awards, and we generally settle by issuing new shares. We also issue cash-settled restricted stock units. These cash-settled units are not counted against the common shares authorized for issuance or available for issuance under the 2004 Plan. Cash-settled units vesting during 2019 , 2018 and 2017 resulted in cash payments to associates of $ 15 million , $ 39 million and $ 42 million , respectively. There was no unrecognized compensation cost for unvested cash-settled units as of December 31, 2019 . Total stock-based compensation expense recognized during 2019 , 2018 and 2017 was $ 239 million , $ 170 million and $ 244 million , respectively. The total income tax benefit for stock-based compensation recognized during 2019 , 2018 and 2017 was $ 50 million , $ 34 million and $ 92 million , respectively. In addition, we maintain an Associate Stock Purchase Plan ( Purchase Plan ), which is a compensatory plan under the accounting guidance for stock-based compensation. We recognized $ 25 million in compensation expense for 2019 and $ 23 million for both 2018 and 2017 . We also maintain a Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan ( DRP ), which allows participating stockholders to purchase additional shares of our common stock through automatic reinvestment of dividends or optional cash investments. Restricted Stock Units and Performance Share Units RSUs represent share-settled awards that do not contain performance conditions and are granted to certain employees at no cost to the recipient. RSUs generally vest over three years from the date of grant; however, some RSUs cliff vest on or shortly after the first or third anniversary of the grant date. RSUs are subject to forfeiture until certain restrictions have lapsed, including continued employment for a specified period of time. PSUs represent share-settled awards that contain performance conditions and are granted to certain employees at no cost to the recipient. PSUs generally vest over three years from the date of grant; however, some PSUs cliff vest on or shortly after the third anniversary of the grant date. The number of PSUs that step vest over three years can be reduced by 50 % or 100 % depending on whether specific performance goals are met during the vesting period. The number of three-year cliff vesting PSUs that will ultimately vest is contingent upon meeting specific performance goals over a three-year period. These PSUs also include an opportunity to receive from 0 % to 150 % of the target number of common shares. A recipient of an RSU or PSU is entitled to receive a share of common stock after the applicable restrictions lapse and is generally entitled to receive cash payments or additional shares of common stock equivalent to any dividends paid on the underlying common stock during the period the RSU or PSU is outstanding, but is not entitled to voting rights. Generally, the value of RSUs and PSUs will equal the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant and the expense is recognized over the vesting period. Certain PSUs have discretionary vesting conditions and are remeasured at fair value each reporting period. 177 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The following table presents a summary of 2019 activity for RSUs and PSUs.

The weighted-average grant date fair value of PSUs was $ 100.65 and $ 82.48 in 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The total fair value of RSUs that vested during 2019 , 2018 and 2017 was $ 122 million , $ 139 million and $ 110 million , respectively. The total fair value of PSUs that vested during 2019 , 2018 and 2017 was $ 82 million , $ 92 million and $ 90 million , respectively. As of December 31, 2019 , the unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSUs $ 157 million , which is expected to be amortized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.8 years ; and the unrecognized compensation related to unvested PSUs was $ 42 million , which is expected to be amortized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1 year . Stock Options Stock options have a maximum contractual term of ten years . Generally, the exercise price of stock options will equal the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. Option vesting is determined at the time of grant and may be subject to the achievement of any applicable performance conditions. Options generally become exercisable over three years beginning on the first anniversary of the date of grant; however, some option grants cliff vest on or shortly after the first or third anniversary of the grant date.

We make non-elective contributions to each eligible associates account and match a portion of associate contributions. We also sponsor a voluntary non-qualified deferred compensation plan in which select groups of employees are eligible to participate. We make contributions to this plan based on participants deferral of salary, bonuses and other eligible pay. In addition, we match participants excess compensation (compensation over the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) compensation limit) less deferrals. We contributed a total of $ 316 million , $ 291 million and $ 282 million to these plans during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans We sponsor a frozen qualified defined benefit pension plan and several non-qualified defined benefit pension plans. We also sponsor a plan that provides other postretirement benefits, including medical and life insurance coverage. Our pension plans and the other postretirement benefit plan are valued using December 31 as the measurement date each year. Our policy is to amortize prior service amounts on a straight-line basis over the average remaining years of service to full eligibility for benefits of active plan participants. The following table sets forth, on an aggregated basis, changes in the benefit obligation and plan assets, the funded status and how the funded status is recognized on our consolidated balance sheets.

We recognized a pre-tax gain of $ 18 million and $ 15 million in other comprehensive income for our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plan in 2019 and 2017 , respectively, compared to a pre-tax loss of $ 17 million in 2018 . Pre-tax amounts recognized in AOCI that have not yet been recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost consist of net actuarial loss of $ 41 million and $ 64 million for our defined benefit pension plans as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, and net actuarial gain of $ 4 million and $ 9 million for our other postretirement benefit plan as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. There was no meaningful prior service cost recognized in AOCI. Plan Assets and Fair Value Measurement Plan assets are invested using a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equity securities and debt securities are used to preserve asset values, diversify risk and enhance our ability to achieve our benchmark for long-term investment return. Investment strategies and asset allocations are based on careful consideration of plan liabilities, the plan funded status and our financial condition. Investment performance and asset allocation are measured and monitored on a quarterly basis. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , our plan assets totaled $ 260 million and $ 224 million , respectively. We invested substantially all our plan assets in common collective trusts, which primarily consist of domestic and international equity securities, government securities and corporate and municipal bonds. Our plan assets were classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2019 . In 2018, investments in common collective trusts were measured at net asset value per share, or its equivalent, as a practical expedient and therefore were not classified in the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2018 . For information on fair value measurements, including descriptions of Level 1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy and the valuation methods we utilize, see Note 16 Fair Value Measurement . Expected Future Benefit Payments As of December 31, 2019 , the benefits expected to be paid in the next ten years totaled $ 100 million for our defined pension benefit plans and $ 18 million for our other postretirement benefit plan, respectively. 180 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 15 INCOME TAXES We recognize the current and deferred tax consequences of all transactions that have been recognized in the financial statements using the provisions of the enacted tax laws. Current income tax expense represents our estimated taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period and includes income tax expense related to our uncertain tax positions, as well as tax-related interest and penalties. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. We record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We record the effect of remeasuring deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates or laws as a component of income tax expense related to continuing operations for the period in which the change is enacted. We subsequently release income tax effects stranded in AOCI using a portfolio approach. Income tax benefits are recognized when, based on their technical merits, they are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. The amount recognized is the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we recognized a tax benefit of $ 284 million as a result of an approval from the IRS related to a tax methodology change on rewards costs. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded charges of $ 1.8 billion associated with the impacts of the Tax Act, and there were no material adjustments made to this amount during the measurement period which ended in December 2018. The following table presents significant components of the provision for income taxes attributable to continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 .

Our federal net operating loss carryforwards were $ 31 million and less than $ 1 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. These operating loss carryforwards were attributable to acquisitions and will expire from 2027 to 2037 , however $ 12 million of these carryforwards do not have an expiration. Under IRS rules, our ability to utilize these losses against future income is limited. The net tax value of our state net operating loss carryforwards were $ 237 million and $ 253 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, and they will expire from 2020 to 2038. Our foreign tax credit carryforward was $ 40 million and $ 19 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. This carryforward will begin expiring in 2028. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of income tax expense. We recognized $ 4 million , $ 6 million and $ 5 million of expense in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. 183 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The following table presents the accrued balance of tax, interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits.

The tax years subject to examination vary by jurisdiction. During 2019, we entered into settlement agreements with states that resolved our outstanding state disputes on the economic nexus issue for prior tax years. We also continued to participate in the IRS Compliance Assurance Process ( CAP ) for our 2017, 2018 and 2019 federal income tax return years, and have been accepted into CAP for 2020. The IRS review of our 2017 federal income tax return is substantially completed, with one issue remaining open. We have proposed a resolution of this issue to the IRS and expect that the issue and the tax year will be closed on an agreed basis during the first quarter of 2020. The IRS review of our 2018 federal income tax return was substantially completed prior to its filing in the fourth quarter of 2019, with the IRS reserving a limited number of issues for further post-filing review that is expected to be completed in 2020. As in prior years, we expect that the IRS review of our 2019 federal income tax return will be substantially completed prior to its filing in 2020. It is reasonably possible that further adjustments to the Company unrecognized tax benefits may be made within 12 months of the reporting date as a result of future judicial or regulatory interpretations of existing tax laws. At this time, an estimate of the potential changes to the amount of unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made. The Tax Act required that all unremitted earnings of our subsidiaries operating outside the U.S. were deemed to be repatriated as of December 31, 2017. As such, a liability of $ 111 million was paid with our 2017 federal tax return for the deemed repatriation of $ 1.5 billion of undistributed foreign earnings. Upon repatriation of these earnings, there would be no additional U.S. federal income taxes. In accordance with the guidance for income taxes in special areas, these earnings are considered by management to be invested indefinitely, except for the earnings of our Philippines subsidiary as we made distributions in 2019 and expect to make distributions in the future. As of December 31, 2019 , U.S. income taxes of $ 69 million have not been provided for approximately $ 287 million of previously acquired thrift bad debt reserves created for tax purposes as of December 31, 1987. These amounts, acquired as a result of previous mergers and acquisitions, are subject to recapture in the unlikely event that CONA, as the successor to the merged and acquired entities, makes distributions in excess of earnings and profits, redeems its stock or liquidates. 184 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 16 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT Fair value, also referred to as an exit price, is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The fair value accounting guidance provides a three-level fair value hierarchy for classifying financial instruments. This hierarchy is based on the markets in which the assets or liabilities trade and whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable. The fair value measurement of a financial asset or liability is assigned a level based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: Level 1: Valuation is based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Valuation is based on observable market-based inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3: Valuation is generated from techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. Valuation techniques include pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques. The accounting guidance for fair value measurements requires that we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in determining fair value. The accounting guidance provides for the irrevocable option to elect, on a contract-by-contract basis, to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value at inception of the contract and record any subsequent changes in fair value in earnings. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The following describes the valuation techniques used in estimating the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Investment Securities Quoted prices in active markets are used to measure the fair value of U.S. Treasury securities. For the majority of securities in other investment categories, we utilize multiple vendor pricing services to obtain fair value measurements. A waterfall of pricing vendors is determined in order of preference. The determination of the top-ranked pricing vendor is made on an annual basis as part of an assessment of the performance of pricing services provided by the vendors. A pricing service may be considered as the preferred or primary pricing provider depending on how closely aligned its prices are to other vendor prices, and how consistent the prices are with other available market information. The price of each security is confirmed by comparing with other vendor prices before it is finalized. RMBS and CMBS securities are generally classified as Level 2 or 3. When significant assumptions are not consistently observable, fair values are derived using the best available data. Such data may include quotes provided by dealers, valuation from external pricing services, independent pricing models, or other model-based valuation techniques, for example, calculation of the present values of future cash flows incorporating assumptions such as benchmark yields, spreads, prepayment speeds, credit ratings and losses. Generally, the pricing services utilize observable market data to the extent available. Pricing models may be used, which can vary by asset class and may also incorporate available trade, bid and other market information. Across asset classes, information such as trader/dealer inputs, credit spreads, forward curves and prepayment speeds are used to help determine appropriate valuations. Because many fixed income securities do not trade on a daily basis, the pricing models may apply available information through processes such as benchmarking curves, grouping securities based on their characteristics and using matrix pricing to prepare valuations. In addition, model processes are used by the pricing services to develop prepayment assumptions. We validate the pricing obtained from the primary pricing providers through comparison of pricing to additional sources, including other pricing services, dealer pricing indications in transaction results and other internal sources. Pricing variances among different pricing sources are analyzed. Additionally, on an on-going basis, we request more detailed information from the valuation vendors to understand the pricing methodology and assumptions used to value the securities. 185 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Derivative Assets and Liabilities We use both exchange-traded and OTC derivatives to manage our interest rate and foreign currency risk exposures. When quoted market prices are available and used to value our exchange-traded derivatives, we classify them as Level 1. However, predominantly all of our derivatives do not have readily available quoted market prices. Therefore, we value most of our derivatives using vendor-based valuation techniques. We primarily rely on market observable inputs for our models, such as interest rate yield curves, credit curves, option volatility and currency rates. These inputs can vary depending on the type of derivatives and nature of the underlying rate, price or index upon which the value of the derivative is based. We typically classify derivatives as Level 2 when significant inputs can be observed in a liquid market and the model itself does not require significant judgment. When instruments are traded in less liquid markets and significant inputs are unobservable, such as interest rate swaps whose remaining terms do not correlate with market observable interest rate yield curves, such derivatives are classified as Level 3. The impact of credit risk valuation adjustments are considered when measuring the fair value of derivative contracts in order to reflect the credit quality of the counterparty and our own credit quality. Official internal pricing is compared against additional pricing sources such as external valuation agents and other internal sources. Pricing variances among different pricing sources are analyzed and validated. These derivatives are included in other assets or other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Loans Held for Sale In our commercial business, we originate multifamily commercial real estate loans with the intent to sell them to GSEs. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, we elected the fair value option for such loans as part of our management of interest rate risk in our multifamily agency business. These held for sale loans are valued based on market observable inputs and are therefore classified as Level 2. Unrealized gains and losses on these loans are recorded in other non-interest income in our consolidated statements of income. Retained Interests in Securitizations We have retained interests in various mortgage securitizations from previous acquisitions. Our retained interests primarily include interest-only bonds and negative amortization bonds. We record these retained interests at fair value using market indications and valuation models to calculate the present value of future cash flows. The models incorporate various assumptions that market participants use in estimating future cash flows including voluntary prepayment rate, discount rate, default rate and loss severity. Due to the use of significant unobservable inputs, retained interests in securitizations are classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy. Deferred Compensation Plan Assets We offer a voluntary non-qualified deferred compensation plan to eligible associates. In addition to participant deferrals, we make contributions to the plan. Participants invest these contributions in a variety of publicly traded mutual funds. The plan assets, which consist of publicly traded mutual funds, are classified as Level 1. The determination of the leveling of financial instruments in the fair value hierarchy is performed at the end of each reporting period. We consider all available information, including observable market data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs. Based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category, judgments are made regarding the significance of the observable or unobservable inputs to the instruments fair value measurement in its entirety. If unobservable inputs are considered significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3. The process for determining fair value using unobservable inputs is generally more subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and assumptions.

Significant Level 3 Fair Value Asset and Liability Inputs Generally, uncertainties in fair value measurements of financial instruments, such as changes in unobservable inputs, may have a significant impact on fair value. Certain of these unobservable inputs will, in isolation, have a directionally consistent impact on the fair value of the instrument for a given change in that input. Alternatively, the fair value of the instrument may move in an opposite direction for a given change in another input. In general, an increase in the discount rate, default rates, loss severity and credit spreads, in isolation, would result in a decrease in the fair value measurement. In addition, an increase in default rates would generally be accompanied by a decrease in recovery rates, slower prepayment rates and an increase in liquidity spreads. Techniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value Measurements The following table presents the significant unobservable inputs used to determine the fair values of our Level 3 financial instruments on a recurring basis. We utilize multiple vendor pricing services to obtain fair value for our securities. Several of our vendor pricing services are only able to provide unobservable input information for a limited number of securities due to software licensing restrictions. Other vendor pricing services are able to provide unobservable input information for all securities for which they provide a valuation. As a result, the unobservable input information for the securities available for sale presented below represents a composite summary of all information we are able to obtain. The unobservable input information for all other Level 3 financial instruments is based on the assumptions used in our internal valuation models. 189 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Table 16.3 : Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements (Dollars in millions) Fair Value at December 31, 2019 Significant Valuation Techniques Significant Unobservable Inputs Range Weighted Average (1) Securities available for sale: RMBS $ 429 Discounted cash flows (vendor pricing) Yield Voluntary prepayment rate Default rate Loss severity 2-18% 0-18% 1-6% 30-95% 5% 10% 2% 67% CMBS 13 Discounted cash flows (vendor pricing) Yield 2-3% 2% Other assets: Retained interests in securitizations (2) 66 Discounted cash flows Life of receivables (months) Voluntary prepayment rate Discount rate Default rate Loss severity 35-51 4-14% 3-10% 2-3% 74-88% N/A Net derivative assets (liabilities) 26 Discounted cash flows Swap rates 2% 2% Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements (Dollars in millions) Fair Value at December 31, 2018 Significant Valuation Techniques Significant Unobservable Inputs Range Weighted Average (1) Securities available for sale: RMBS $ 433 Discounted cash flows (vendor pricing) Yield Voluntary prepayment rate Default rate Loss severity 3-11% 0-17% 0-7% 0-75% 5% 5% 3% 65% CMBS 10 Discounted cash flows (vendor pricing) Yield 3% 3% Other assets: Retained interests in securitizations (2) 158 Discounted cash flows Life of receivables (months) Voluntary prepayment rate Discount rate Default rate Loss severity 3-56 3-14% 4-6% 2-4% 50-104% N/A Net derivative assets (liabilities) ( 10 ) Discounted cash flows Swap rates 3% 3% __________ (1) Weighted averages are calculated by using the product of the input multiplied by the relative fair value of the instruments. (2) Due to the nature of the various mortgage securitization structures in which we have retained interests, it is not meaningful to present a consolidated weighted average for the significant unobservable inputs. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis We are required to measure and recognize certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on the consolidated balance sheets. These assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (for example, from the application of lower of cost or fair value accounting or when we evaluate for impairment). The following describes the valuation techniques used in estimating the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Net Loans Held for Investment For loans held for investment that are recorded at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets and measured on a nonrecurring basis, the fair value is determined using appraisal values that are obtained from independent appraisers, broker pricing opinions or other available market information, adjusted for the estimated cost to sell. Due to the use of significant unobservable inputs, these loans are classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy. Fair value adjustments for individually impaired collateralized loans held for investment are recorded in provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of income. 190 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Loans Held for Sale Loans held for sale for which we have not elected the fair value option are carried at the lower of aggregate cost, net of deferred fees and deferred origination costs, or fair value. These loans held for sale are valued based on market observable inputs and are therefore classified as Level 2. Fair value adjustments to these loans are recorded in other non-interest income in our consolidated statements of income. Other Assets Other assets subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements include equity investments accounted for under measurement alternative, other repossessed assets and long-lived assets held for sale. These assets held for sale are carried at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. The fair value is determined based on the appraisal value, listing price of the property or collateral provided by independent appraisers, and is adjusted for the estimated costs to sell. Due to the use of significant unobservable inputs, these assets are classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy. Fair value adjustments for these assets are recorded in other non-interest expense in the consolidated statements of income. The following table presents the carrying value of the assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and still held as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , and for which a nonrecurring fair value measurement was recorded during the year then ended.

As of December 31, 2018 , other assets included equity investments accounted for under the measurement alternative of $ 24 million , foreclosed property and repossessed assets of $ 57 million and long-lived assets held for sale of $ 19 million . In the above table, loans held for investment are generally valued based in part on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral and the non-recoverable rate, which is considered to be a significant unobservable input. The non-recoverable rate ranged from 0 % to 50 % , with a weighted average of 6 % , and from 0 % to 84 % , with a weighted average of 33 % , as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The weighted average non-recoverable rate is calculated based on the estimated market value of the underlying collateral. The significant unobservable inputs and related quantitative information related to fair value of the other assets are not meaningful to disclose as they vary significantly across properties and collateral. 191 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The following table presents total nonrecurring fair value measurements for the period, included in earnings, attributable to the change in fair value relating to assets that are still held at December 31, 2019 and 2018 .

The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio, asset/liability management by our centralized Corporate Treasury group and residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate that is not assessed to our primary business segments, are included in the Other category. Credit Card: Consists of our domestic consumer and small business card lending, and international card businesses in Canada and the United Kingdom. Consumer Banking: Consists of our deposit gathering and lending activities for consumers and small businesses, and national auto lending. Commercial Banking: Consists of our lending, deposit gathering, capital markets and treasury management services to commercial real estate and commercial and industrial customers. Our commercial and industrial customers typically include companies with annual revenues between $20 million and $2 billion. Other category: Includes the residual impact of the allocation of our centralized Corporate Treasury group activities, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability management, to our business segments. Accordingly, net gains and losses on our investment securities portfolio and certain trading activities are included in the Other category. Other category also includes foreign exchange-rate fluctuations on foreign currency-denominated transactions; unallocated corporate expenses that do not directly support the operations of the business segments or for which the business segments are not considered financially accountable in evaluating their performance, such as certain restructuring charges; certain material items that are non-recurring in nature; offsets related to certain line-item reclassifications; and residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate that is not assessed to our primary business segments. Basis of Presentation We report the results of each of our business segments on a continuing operations basis. The results of our individual businesses reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources. Business Segment Reporting Methodology The results of our business segments are intended to present each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. Our internal management and reporting process used to derive our segment results employs various allocation methodologies, including funds transfer pricing, to assign certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses directly or indirectly attributable to each business segment. Our funds transfer pricing process provides a funds credit for sources of funds, such as deposits generated by our Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking businesses, and a funds charge for the use of funds by each segment. Due to the integrated nature of our business segments, estimates and judgments have been made in allocating certain revenue and expense items. Transactions between segments are based on specific criteria or approximate third-party rates. We regularly assess the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, which may result in the implementation of refinements or changes in future periods. The following is additional information on the principles and methodologies used in preparing our business segment results. Net interest income: Interest income from loans held for investment and interest expense from deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities are reflected within each applicable business segment. Because funding and asset/liability management are managed centrally by our Corporate Treasury group, net interest income for our business segments also includes the results of a funds transfer pricing process that is intended to allocate a cost of funds used or credit for funds provided to all business segment assets and liabilities, respectively, using a matched funding concept. The taxable-equivalent benefit of tax-exempt products is also allocated to each business unit with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. 194 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Non-interest income: Non-interest fees and other revenue associated with loans or customers managed by each business segment and other direct revenues are accounted for within each business segment. Provision for credit losses: The provision for credit losses is directly attributable to the business segment in accordance with the loans each business segment manages. Non-interest expense: Non-interest expenses directly managed and incurred by a business segment are accounted for within each business segment. We allocate certain non-interest expenses indirectly incurred by business segments, such as corporate support functions, to each business segment based on various factors, including the actual cost of the services from the service providers, the utilization of the services, the number of employees or other relevant factors. Goodwill and intangible assets: Goodwill and intangible assets that are not directly attributable to business segments are assigned to business segments based on the relative fair value of each segment. Intangible amortization is included in the results of the applicable segment. Income taxes: Income taxes are assessed for each business segment based on a standard tax rate with the residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate included in the Other category. Loans held for investment: Loans are reported within each business segment based on product or customer type served by that business segment. Deposits: Deposits are reported within each business segment based on product or customer type served by that business segment. Segment Results and Reconciliation We may periodically change our business segments or reclassify business segment results based on modifications to our management reporting methodologies or changes in organizational alignment. In the first quarter of 2019, we made a change in how revenue is measured in our Commercial Banking business by revising the allocation of tax benefits on certain tax-advantaged investments. As such, 2018 results have been recast to conform with the current period presentation. The result of this measurement change reduced the previously reported total net revenue in our Commercial Banking business by $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 , with an offsetting increase in the Other category.

Accordingly, we present our Commercial Banking revenue and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated using the federal statutory tax rate (21% for 2019 and 2018 and 35% for 2017) and state taxes where applicable, with offsetting reductions to the Other category. (2) In the first quarter of 2019, we made a change in how revenue is measured in our Commercial Banking business by revising the allocation of tax benefits on certain tax-advantaged investments. As such, 2018 results have been recast to conform with the current period presentation. The result of this measurement change reduced the previously reported total net revenue in our Commercial Banking business by $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 , with an offsetting increase in the Other category. Revenue from Contracts with Customers The majority of our revenue from contracts with customers consists of interchange fees, service charges and other customer-related fees, and other contract revenue. Interchange fees are primarily from our Credit Card business and are recognized upon settlement with the interchange networks, net of rewards earned by customers. Service charges and other customer-related fees within our Consumer Banking business are primarily related to fees earned on consumer deposit accounts for account maintenance and various transaction-based services such as overdrafts and ATM usage. Service charges and other customer-related fees within our Commercial Banking business are mostly related to fees earned on treasury management and capital markets services. Other contract revenue in our Credit Card business consists primarily of revenue from our partnership arrangements. Other contract revenue in our Consumer Banking business consists primarily of revenue earned on certain marketing and promotional events from our auto dealers. Revenue from contracts with customers is included in non-interest income in our consolidated statements of income. 196 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The following table presents revenue from contracts with customers and a reconciliation to non-interest income by business segment for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 .

These commitments, other than credit card lines, are legally binding conditional agreements that have fixed expirations or termination dates and specified interest rates and purposes. The contractual amount of these commitments represents the maximum possible credit risk to us should the counterparty draw upon the commitment. We generally manage the potential risk of unfunded lending commitments by limiting the total amount of arrangements, monitoring the size and maturity structure of these portfolios, and applying the same credit standards for all of our credit activities. For unused credit card lines, we have not experienced and do not anticipate that all of our customers will access their entire available line at any given point in time. Commitments to extend credit other than credit card lines generally require customers to maintain certain credit standards. Collateral requirements and loan-to-value ( LTV ) ratios are the same as those for funded transactions and are established based on management credit assessment of the customer. These commitments may expire without being drawn upon; therefore, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future funding requirements. We also issue letters of credit, such as financial standby, performance standby and commercial letters of credit, to meet the financing needs of our customers. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party in a borrowing arrangement. Commercial letters of credit are short-term commitments issued primarily to facilitate trade finance activities for customers and are generally collateralized by the goods being shipped to the customer. These collateral requirements are similar to those for funded transactions and are established based on management credit assessment of the customer. Management conducts regular reviews of all outstanding letters of credit and the results of these reviews are considered in assessing the adequacy of reserves for unfunded lending commitments. The following table presents the contractual amount and carrying value of our unfunded lending commitments as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 . The carrying value represents our reserve and deferred revenue on legally binding commitments. Table 18.1 : Unfunded Lending Commitments Contractual Amount Carrying Value (Dollars in millions) December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Credit card lines $ 363,446 $ 346,186 N/A N/A Other loan commitments (1) 36,454 34,449 $ 110 $ 95 Standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit (2) 1,574 1,792 27 29 Total unfunded lending commitments $ 401,474 $ 382,427 $ 137 $ 124 __________ (1) Includes $ 1.6 billion and $ 1.3 billion of advised lines of credit as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. (2) These financial guarantees have expiration dates ranging from 2020 to 2022 as of December 31, 2019 . Loss Sharing Agreements Within our Commercial Banking business, we originate multifamily commercial real estate loans with the intent to sell them to the GSEs. We enter into loss sharing agreements with the GSEs upon the sale of the loans. At inception, we record a liability representing the fair value of our obligation which is subsequently amortized as we are released from risk of payment under the loss sharing agreement. If payment under the loss sharing agreement becomes probable and estimable, an additional liability may be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets and a non-interest expense may be recognized in the consolidated statements of income. The liability recognized on our consolidated balance sheets for these loss sharing agreements was $ 75 million and $ 59 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. See Note 4 Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments for more information related to our c redit card partnership loss sharing arrangements. 198 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS U.K. Payment Protection Insurance In the U.K., we previously sold payment protection insurance ( PPI ). In response to an elevated level of customer complaints across the industry, heightened media coverage and pressure from consumer advocacy groups, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority ( FCA ), formerly the Financial Services Authority, investigated and raised concerns about the way the industry has handled complaints related to the sale of these insurance policies. For the past several years, the U.K. Financial Ombudsman Service ( FOS ) has been adjudicating customer complaints relating to PPI, escalated to it by consumers who disagree with the rejection of their complaint by firms, leading to customer remediation payments by us and others within the industry. In August 2017, the FCA issued final rules and guidance on the PPI complaints. This set the deadline for complaints as August 29, 2019. It also provided clarity on how to handle PPI complaints under s.140A of the Consumer Credit Act, including guidance on how redress for such complaints should be calculated. In determining our best estimate of incurred losses for future remediation payments, management considers numerous factors, including (i) the number of customer complaints or information requests still to be processed; (ii) our expectation of upholding those complaints; (iii) the expected number of complaints customers escalate to the FOS; (iv) our expectation of the FOS upholding such escalated complaints; (v) the number of complaints that fall under s.140A of the Consumer Credit Act; and (vi) the estimated remediation payout to customers. We monitor these factors each quarter and adjust our reserves to reflect the latest data. Our U.K. PPI reserve totaled $ 188 million and $ 133 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. In 2019 , we recorded an additional reserve build of $ 212 million due to significantly elevated claims volume ahead of the August 29, 2019 claims submission deadline. Our best estimate of reasonably possible future losses beyond our reserve as of December 31, 2019 is approximately $ 50 million . Litigation In accordance with the current accounting standards for loss contingencies, we establish reserves for litigation-related matters that arise from the ordinary course of our business activities when it is probable that a loss associated with a claim or proceeding has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. None of the amounts we currently have recorded individually or in the aggregate are considered to be material to our financial condition. Litigation claims and proceedings of all types are subject to many uncertain factors that generally cannot be predicted with assurance. Below we provide a description of potentially material legal proceedings and claims. For some of the matters disclosed below, we are able to estimate reasonably possible losses above existing reserves, and for other disclosed matters, such an estimate is not possible at this time. For those matters below where an estimate is possible, management currently estimates the reasonably possible future losses beyond our reserves as of December 31, 2019 are approximately $ 1.1 billion . Our reserve and reasonably possible loss estimates involve considerable judgment and reflect that there is still significant uncertainty regarding numerous factors that may impact the ultimate loss levels. Notwithstanding our attempt to estimate a reasonably possible range of loss beyond our current accrual levels for some litigation matters based on current information, it is possible that actual future losses will exceed both the current accrual level and the range of reasonably possible losses disclosed here. Given the inherent uncertainties involved in these matters, especially those involving governmental agencies, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters, there is significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability we may incur from these litigation matters and an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period. Interchange In 2005, a putative class of retail merchants filed antitrust lawsuits against MasterCard and Visa and several issuing banks, including Capital One, seeking both injunctive relief and monetary damages for an alleged conspiracy by defendants to fix the level of interchange fees. Other merchants have asserted similar claims in separate lawsuits, and while these separate cases did not name any issuing banks, Visa, MasterCard and issuers, including Capital One, have entered settlement and judgment sharing agreements allocating the liabilities of any judgment or settlement arising from all interchange-related cases. The lawsuits were consolidated before the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York for certain purposes and were settled in 2012. The class settlement, however, was invalidated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in June 2016, and the suit was bifurcated into separate class actions seeking injunctive and monetary relief, respectively. In addition, numerous merchant groups opted out of the 2012 settlement and have pursued their own claims. The claims by the injunctive relief 199 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS class have not been resolved, but the settlement of $ 5.5 billion for the monetary damages class has received final approval from the trial court, and has been appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Visa and MasterCard have also settled several of the opt-out cases, which required non-material payments from issuing banks, including Capital One. Visa created a litigation escrow account following its initial public offering of stock in 2008 that funds settlements for its member banks, and any settlements related to MasterCard-allocated losses have either already been paid or are reflected in our reserves. Mortgage Representation and Warranty We face residual exposure related to subsidiaries that originated residential mortgage loans and sold these loans to various purchasers, including purchasers who created securitization trusts. In connection with their sales of mortgage loans, these subsidiaries entered into agreements containing varying representations and warranties about, among other things, the ownership of the loan, the validity of the lien securing the loan, the loan compliance with any applicable criteria established by the purchaser, including underwriting guidelines and the existence of mortgage insurance, and the loan compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws. Each of these subsidiaries may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify certain purchasers and others against losses they incur in the event of certain breaches of these representations and warranties. The substantial majority of our representation and warranty exposure has been resolved through litigation, and our remaining representation and warranty exposure is almost entirely litigation-related. Accordingly, we establish litigation reserves for representation and warranty losses that we consider to be both probable and reasonably estimable. The reserve process relies heavily on estimates, which are inherently uncertain, and requires the application of judgment. Our reserves and estimates of reasonably possible losses could be impacted by claims which may be brought by securitization trustees and sponsors, bond-insurers, investors, and GSEs, as well as claims brought by governmental agencies. Anti-Money Laundering In October 2018, we paid a civil monetary penalty of $ 100 million to resolve the monetary component of a July 2015 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) consent order relating to our anti-money laundering ( AML ) program. The OCC lifted the AML consent order in November 2019. The Department of Justice and the New York District Attorney Office have closed their investigations into certain former check casher clients of the Commercial Banking business and our AML program. We are in discussions with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network ( FinCEN ) of the U.S. Department of Treasury to explore a potential regulatory resolution of its investigation into our AML program, which could include a monetary penalty. Cybersecurity Incident As a result of the Cybersecurity Incident announced on July 29, 2019, we are subject to numerous legal proceedings and other inquiries and could be the subject of additional proceedings and inquiries in the future. Although it is reasonably possible that we may incur losses associated with these legal proceedings and other inquiries, it is not possible to estimate the amount or range of possible losses, if any, at this time. Consumer class actions . To date, we have been named as a defendant in approximately 72 putative consumer class action cases ( 61 in U.S. federal courts and 11 in Canadian courts) alleging harm from the Cybersecurity Incident and seeking various remedies, including monetary and injunctive relief. The lawsuits allege breach of contract, negligence, violations of various privacy laws and a variety of other legal causes of action. On October 2, 2019, the U.S. consumer class actions were consolidated for pretrial proceedings before a multi-district litigation ( MDL ) panel in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Alexandria Division. Securities class action . The Company and certain officers have also been named as defendants in a putative class action pending in the MDL alleging violations of certain federal securities laws in connection with statements and alleged omissions in securities filings relating to our information security standards and practices. The complaint seeks certification of a class of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired Capital One securities from July 23, 2015 to July 29, 2019, as well as unspecified monetary damages, costs and other relief. Governmental inquiries . We have received inquiries and requests for information relating to the Cybersecurity Incident from Congress, federal banking regulators, Canadian banking regulators, the Department of Justice and the offices of approximately fourteen state Attorneys General. We are cooperating with these offices and responding to their inquiries. 200 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Taxi Medallion Finance Investigations We received a subpoena from the New York Attorney General office in August 2019 and a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney Office for the Southern District of New York, Civil Division, in October 2019 relating to investigations of the taxi medallion finance industry we exited beginning in 2015. The subpoenas seek, among other things, information regarding our lending counterparties and practices. We are cooperating with these investigations. U.K. PPI Litigation Some of the claimants in the U.K. PPI regulatory claims process described above have initiated legal proceedings. The significant increase in PPI regulatory claim volumes shortly before the August 29, 2019 claims submission deadline increases the potential exposure for PPI-related litigation, which is not subject to the August 29, 2019 deadline. Other Pending and Threatened Litigation In addition, we are commonly subject to various pending and threatened legal actions relating to the conduct of our normal business activities. In the opinion of management, the ultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising out of all such other pending or threatened legal actions, is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial position or our results of operations. 201 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 19 CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION (PARENT COMPANY ONLY) Financial Information The following parent company only financial statements are prepared in accordance with Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).

In addition, we regularly consider the potential disposition of certain of our assets, branches, partnership agreements or lines of business. On September 24, 2019, we launched a new credit card issuance program with Walmart Inc. ( Walmart ) and are now the exclusive issuer of Walmart cobrand and private label credit card program in the U.S. On October 11, 2019, we completed the acquisition of the existing portfolio of Walmart cobrand and private label credit card receivables. The acquisition was accounted for as an asset acquisition and total cash consideration for the acquisition was $ 8.2 billion . On the date of acquisition, we recognized approximately $ 8.2 billion in assets, primarily consisting of $ 8.1 billion in credit card receivables and $ 81 million of accrued interest. We recorded an initial allowance build of $ 84 million on the acquired loans. During 2019, we also recognized approximately $ 211 million of launch and integration expense related to the Walmart partnership. Results of the acquisition and partnership program are included within our Credit Card segment. In the second quarter of 2019, we made the decision to exit several small partnership portfolios in our Credit Card business. We sold approximately $ 900 million of receivables and transferred approximately $ 100 million to loans held for sale as of June 30, 2019, which resulted in a gain on sale of $ 49 million recognized in other non-interest income and an allowance release of $ 68 million . We also periodically initiate restructuring activities to support business strategies and enhance our overall operational efficiency. These restructuring activities have primarily consisted of exiting certain business locations and activities as well as the realignment of resources supporting various businesses. The charges incurred as a result of these restructuring activities have primarily consisted of severance and related benefits pursuant to our ongoing benefit programs, which are included in salaries and associate benefits within non-interest expense in our consolidated statements of income, as well as impairment of certain assets related to business locations and activities being exited, which are generally included in occupancy and equipment within non-interest expense. For the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recognized restructuring charges of $ 28 million and $ 34 million , respectively, which are reflected in the Other category of our business segment results. 205 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Overview We are required under applicable laws and regulations to maintain controls and procedures, which include disclosure controls and procedures as well as internal control over financial reporting, as further described below. (a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures refer to controls and other procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our financial reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding our required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and we must apply judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ), our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2019 , the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2019 , at a reasonable level of assurance, in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting information required to be disclosed within the time periods specified by the SEC rules and forms. (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We regularly review our disclosure controls and procedures and make changes intended to ensure the quality of our financial reporting. There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2019 which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company internal control over financial reporting. (c) Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting is included in Part II Item 8.
