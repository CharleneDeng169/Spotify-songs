Recent Events Capital Management Following completion of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) 2018 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), the Federal Reserve did not object to the Corporation capital plan, which is estimated to return approximately $26 billion to common shareholders over the next four quarters through a quarterly common stock dividend increase and common stock repurchases. That estimate is based upon the Corporation current number of outstanding shares and share price. As part of the capital plan, on July 26, 2018 , the Corporation Board of Directors (the Board) declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.15 per share, an increase of 25 percent, payable on September 28, 2018 to shareholders of record as of September 7, 2018 . Also, on June 28, 2018, the Board authorized the repurchase of approximately $20.6 billion in common stock from July 1, 2018 through June 30, 2019, which includes approximately $600 million in repurchases to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans during the same period. The repurchase program covers both common stock and warrants. For additional information, see the Corporation Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on June 28, 2018. During the second quarter of 2018 , we repurchased $5.0 billion of common stock pursuant to the Board repurchase authorizations announced on June 28, 2017 and December 5, 2017. These repurchase authorizations expired on June 30, 2018. For additional information, see Capital Management on page 22 . Trust Preferred Securities Redemption On April 30, 2018, the Corporation announced that it submitted redemption notices for 11 series of trust preferred securities, resulting in the redemption of such trust preferred securities along with the applicable trust common securities (held by the Corporation or its affiliates) on June 6, 2018. Upon redemption of the trust preferred securities and the extinguishment of the related junior subordinated notes issued by the Corporation, we recorded a charge to other income of $729 million . For additional information, see Liquidity Risk on page 26 and the Corporation Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on April 30, 2018. 3 Bank of America Financial Highlights Table 1 Summary Income Statement and Selected Financial Data Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 (Dollars in millions, except per share information) 2018 2017 2018 2017 Income statement Net interest income $ 11,650 $ 10,986 $ 23,258 $ 22,044 Noninterest income 10,959 11,843 22,476 23,033 Total revenue, net of interest expense 22,609 22,829 45,734 45,077 Provision for credit losses 827 726 1,661 1,561 Noninterest expense 13,284 13,982 27,181 28,075 Income before income taxes 8,498 8,121 16,892 15,441 Income tax expense 1,714 3,015 3,190 4,998 Net income 6,784 5,106 13,702 10,443 Preferred stock dividends 318 361 746 863 Net income applicable to common shareholders $ 6,466 $ 4,745 $ 12,956 $ 9,580 Per common share information Earnings $ 0.64 $ 0.47 $ 1.26 $ 0.95 Diluted earnings 0.63 0.44 1.25 0.89 Dividends paid 0.12 0.075 0.24 0.15 Performance ratios Return on average assets 1.17 % 0.90 % 1.19 % 0.94 % Return on average common shareholders equity 10.75 7.75 10.80 7.91 Return on average tangible common shareholders equity (1) 15.15 10.87 15.21 11.15 Efficiency ratio 58.76 61.25 59.43 62.28 June 30 2018 December 31 2017 Balance sheet Total loans and leases $ 935,824 $ 936,749 Total assets 2,291,670 2,281,234 Total deposits 1,309,691 1,309,545 Total common shareholders equity 241,035 244,823 Total shareholders equity 264,216 267,146 (1) Return on average tangible common shareholders equity is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information and a corresponding reconciliation to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) financial measures, see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 53 . Net income was $6.8 billion and $13.7 billion , or $0.63 and $1.25 per diluted share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $5.1 billion and $10.4 billion , or $0.44 and $0.89 per diluted share for the same periods in 2017. The improvement in net income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 was driven by a decrease in income tax expense due to the impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act), an increase in net interest income and a decline in noninterest expense, partially offset by a decline in noninterest income. Impacts from the Tax Act include a reduction in the federal tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. Total assets increased $10.4 billion from December 31, 2017 to $2.3 trillion at June 30, 2018 driven by higher cash and cash equivalents from liquidity management actions and an increase in securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell due to growth in Global Markets . These increases were partially offset by decreases in trading account assets due to reduced inventory levels in Global Markets and lower loans held-for-sale (LHFS). Total liabilities increased $13.4 billion from December 31, 2017 to $2.0 trillion at June 30, 2018 primarily driven by higher short-term borrowings due to higher Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances and an increase in trading account liabilities driven by activity in Global Markets . Shareholders equity decreased $2.9 billion from December 31, 2017 primarily due to returns of capital to shareholders through common stock repurchases and common and preferred stock dividends, market value declines in debt securities and the redemption of preferred stock, partially offset by net income and issuances of preferred stock. Net Interest Income Net interest income increased $664 million to $11.7 billion , and $1.2 billion to $23.3 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017 . The net interest yield increased five basis points (bps) to 2.34 percent, and three bps to 2.35 percent for the same periods. These increases were primarily driven by higher interest rates and higher commercial loan balances funded by deposit growth, partially offset by the impact of the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business in the second quarter of 2017 and, for the six months ended June 30, 2018, higher funding costs in Global Markets .

Bank of America 4 Noninterest Income Table 2 Noninterest Income Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 (Dollars in millions) 2018 2017 2018 2017 Card income $ 1,542 $ 1,469 $ 2,999 $ 2,918 Service charges 1,954 1,977 3,875 3,895 Investment and brokerage services 3,458 3,460 7,122 6,877 Investment banking income 1,422 1,532 2,775 3,116 Trading account profits 2,315 1,956 5,014 4,287 Other income 268 1,449 691 1,940 Total noninterest income $ 10,959 $ 11,843 $ 22,476 $ 23,033 Noninterest income decreased $884 million to $11.0 billion , and $557 million to $22.5 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017 . The following highlights the significant changes. Investment and brokerage services income increased $245 million for the six-month period primarily due to assets under management (AUM) flows and higher market valuations, partially offset by the impact of changing market dynamics on transactional revenue and AUM pricing. Investment banking income decreased $110 million and $341 million primarily due to declines in advisory fees and debt issuances, partially offset by an increase in equity issuances. Trading account profits increased $359 million and $727 million primarily driven by increased client activity in equity financing and derivatives, and strong trading performance in equity derivatives and macro-related products, partially offset by weakness in credit products. Other income decreased $1.2 billion in both periods primarily due to the impact of a $793 million pretax gain recognized in the second quarter of 2017 in connection with the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business and, in the second quarter of 2018, a negative impact from a $729 million charge related to the redemption of certain trust preferred securities, partially offset by a $572 million gain from the sale of certain non-core mortgage loans. Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses increased $101 million to $827 million , and $100 million to $1.7 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017 primarily due to portfolio seasoning and loan growth in the U.S. credit card portfolio and a slower pace of improvement in the consumer real estate portfolio. The increases were partially offset by improvement in the commercial portfolio primarily driven by a reduction in energy exposures, and the impact of the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business during the second quarter of 2017. For more information on the provision for credit losses, see Provision for Credit Losses on page 45 . Noninterest Expense Table 3 Noninterest Expense Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 (Dollars in millions) 2018 2017 2018 2017 Personnel $ 7,944 $ 8,040 $ 16,424 $ 16,515 Occupancy 1,022 1,001 2,036 2,001 Equipment 415 427 857 865 Marketing 395 442 740 774 Professional fees 399 485 780 941 Data processing 797 773 1,607 1,567 Telecommunications 166 177 349 368 Other general operating 2,146 2,637 4,388 5,044 Total noninterest expense $ 13,284 $ 13,982 $ 27,181 $ 28,075 Noninterest expense decreased $698 million to $13.3 billion , and $894 million to $27.2 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017 primarily driven by lower other general operating expense. The decrease in other general operating expense resulted from a $295 million impairment charge recognized in the second quarter of 2017 related to certain data centers as well as lower litigation expense in 2018. Most other expense categories also declined compared to the same periods in 2017 reflecting operating efficiencies. Income Tax Expense Table 4 Income Tax Expense Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 (Dollars in millions) 2018 2017 2018 2017 Income before income taxes $ 8,498 $ 8,121 $ 16,892 $ 15,441 Income tax expense 1,714 3,015 3,190 4,998 Effective tax rate 20.2 % 37.1 % 18.9 % 32.4 % 5 Bank of America The effective tax rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 reflect the 21 percent federal tax rate and the other provisions of the Tax Act, as well as the impact of our recurring tax preference benefits. The six-month effective rate also included tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. The effective tax rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 were driven by the impact of our recurring tax preference benefits partially offset by a tax charge related to the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business during the second quarter of 2017. The six-month effective tax rate also included tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. We expect the effective tax rate for the second half of 2018 to be approximately 21 percent, absent unusual items. Supplemental Financial Data In this Form 10-Q, we present certain non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items or otherwise include components that differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional useful information to assess our financial condition, results of operations (including period-to-period operating performance) or compliance with prospective regulatory requirements. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same way as non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. We view net interest income and related ratios and analyses on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis, which when presented on a consolidated basis, are non-GAAP financial measures. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 21 percent for 2018 (35 percent for all prior periods) and a representative state tax rate. In addition, certain performance measures, including the efficiency ratio and net interest yield, utilize net interest income (and thus total revenue) on an FTE basis. The efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue, and net interest yield measures the bps we earn over the cost of funds. We believe that presentation of these items on an FTE basis allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practices. We may present certain key performance indicators and ratios excluding certain items (e.g., debit valuation adjustment (DVA) gains (losses)) which result in non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the presentation of measures that exclude these items is useful because such measures provide additional information to assess the underlying operational performance and trends of our businesses and to allow better comparison of period-to-period operating performance. We also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents an adjusted shareholders equity or common shareholders equity amount which has been reduced by goodwill and certain acquired intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)), net of related deferred tax liabilities. These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models use both return on average tangible common shareholders equity and return on average tangible shareholders equity as key measures to support our overall growth goals. These ratios are as follows: Return on average tangible common shareholders equity measures our earnings contribution as a percentage of adjusted common shareholders equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders equity divided by total assets less goodwill and certain acquired intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on average tangible shareholders equity measures our earnings contribution as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders equity divided by total assets less goodwill and certain acquired intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders equity divided by ending common shares outstanding. We believe that the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. Tangible book value per share provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation to outstanding shares of common stock. The aforementioned supplemental data and performance measures are presented in Tables 5 and 6. For more information on the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 53 .

Bank of America 10 Business Segment Operations Segment Description and Basis of Presentation We report our results of operations through the following four business segments: Consumer Banking , GWIM , Global Banking and Global Markets , with the remaining operations recorded in All Other . We periodically review capital allocated to our businesses and allocate capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. We utilize a methodology that considers the effect of regulatory capital requirements in addition to internal risk-based capital models. Our internal risk-based capital models use a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment credit, market, interest rate, business and operational risk components. For more information on the nature of these risks, see Managing Risk on page 22 . The capital allocated to the business segments is referred to as allocated capital. Allocated equity in the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting unit. For more information, see Note 8 Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements . For more information on the basis of presentation for business segments and reconciliations to consolidated total revenue, net income and period-end total assets, see Note 17 Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements .

Consumer Banking, which is comprised of Deposits and Consumer Lending, offers a diversified range of credit, banking and investment products and services to consumers and small businesses. Deposits and Consumer Lending include the net impact of migrating customers and their related deposit, brokerage asset and loan balances between Deposits, Consumer Lending and GWIM , as well as other client-managed business. For more information about Consumer Banking , including our Deposits and Consumer Lending businesses, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Consumer Banking Results Three Months Ended June 30, 2018 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2017 Net income for Consumer Banking increased $852 million to $2.9 billion primarily driven by higher pretax income and lower tax expense from the impact of the reduction in the federal income tax rate. The increase in pretax income was driven by an increase in revenue, partially offset by higher provision for credit losses. Net interest income increased $659 million to $6.6 billion primarily due to the beneficial impact of an increase in investable assets as a result of higher deposits and interest rates, as well as pricing discipline and loan growth. Noninterest income increased $43 million to $2.6 billion as higher card income and service charges more than offset lower mortgage banking income. The provision for credit losses increased $110 million to $944 million due to portfolio seasoning and loan growth in the U.S. credit card portfolio. Noninterest expense decreased $14 million to $4.4 billion driven by operating efficiencies. This was largely offset by investments in digital capabilities and business growth, including increased primary sales professionals, combined with investments in new financial centers and renovations, as well as higher personnel expense. The return on average allocated capital was 31 percent, up from 22 percent, driven by higher net income. For additional information on capital allocations, see Business Segment Operations on page 11 . Six Months Ended June 30, 2018 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2017 Net income for Consumer Banking increased $1.7 billion to $5.6 billion primarily driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion. The increase in pretax income was driven by an increase in revenue, partially offset by higher provision for credit losses and an increase in noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $1.4 billion to $13.1 billion , and noninterest income increased $62 million to $5.1 billion , both of which were primarily due to the same factors as described in the three-month discussion. The provision for credit losses increased $207 million to $1.9 billion due to the same factors as described in the three-month discussion. Noninterest expense increased $57 million to $8.9 Bank of America 12 billion driven by investments in digital capabilities and business growth, including increased primary sales professionals, combined with investments in new financial centers and renovations, as well as higher personnel expense. These increases were largely offset by operating efficiencies and lower litigation expense. The return on average allocated capital was 30 percent, up from 21 percent, driven by higher net income. For additional information on capital allocations, see Business Segment Operations on page 11 . Deposits Three Months Ended June 30, 2018 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2017 Net income for Deposits increased $641 million to $1.8 billion driven by higher revenue and lower income taxes, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $617 million to $3.9 billion primarily due to the beneficial impact of an increase in investable assets as a result of higher deposits, and pricing discipline.

Noninterest income, which primarily includes investment and brokerage services income, increased $68 million to $3.2 billion . The increase was driven by the impact of AUM flows and higher market valuations, partially offset by the impact of changing market dynamics on transactional revenue and AUM pricing. Noninterest expense of $3.4 billion increased modestly, as higher revenue-related incentive expense and investment in sales professionals was largely offset by continued expense discipline. Return on average allocated capital was 27 percent, up from 23 percent, primarily due to higher net income, somewhat offset by an increase in allocated capital. MLGWM revenue of $3.9 billion remained relatively unchanged. U.S. Trust revenue of $ 848 million increased four percent reflecting higher net interest income and asset management fees driven by higher market valuations and positive net flows. Six Months Ended June 30, 2018 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2017 Net income for GWIM increased $ 426 million to $2.0 billion due to higher revenue and lower tax expense, partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense.

Global Markets product coverage includes securities and derivative products in both the primary and secondary markets. For more information about Global Markets , see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Three Months Ended June 30, 2018 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2017 Net income for Global Markets increased $286 million to $1.1 billion driven by higher revenue and lower tax expense from the impact of the reduction in the federal income tax rate, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Net DVA losses were $179 million compared to losses of $159 million . Excluding net DVA, net income increased $323 million to $1.3 billion primarily driven by higher revenue and the impact of the Tax Act, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, increased $227 million primarily due to higher Equities revenue driven by increased client financing activity. Noninterest expense increased $65 million to $2.7 billion primarily due to higher revenue-related expense and continued investments in technology. Average assets increased $33.3 billion to $678.5 billion primarily driven by growth in client financing activities in the Equities business and increased levels of inventory across the fixed-income, currencies and commodities (FICC) business to facilitate client demand. The return on average allocated capital was 13 percent , up from 10 percent , reflecting higher net income. Six Months Ended June 30, 2018 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2017 Net income for Global Markets increased $447 million to $2.6 billion driven by higher revenue and lower tax expense from the impact of the reduction in the federal income tax rate. Net DVA losses were $115 million compared to losses of $289 million . Excluding net DVA, net income increased $355 million to $2.7 billion primarily driven by higher revenue and the impact of the Tax Act, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, increased $251 million due to higher Equities revenue partially offset by lower FICC revenue. Noninterest expense increased $127 million to $5.5 billion primarily due to continued investments in technology. Average assets increased $52.2 billion to $678.4 billion primarily driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion. Total period-end assets increased $8.1 billion to $637.1 billion due to increased levels of inventory across the FICC business to facilitate client demand. The return on average allocated capital was 15 percent , up from 12 percent , reflecting higher net income. Sales and Trading Revenue For a description of sales and trading revenue, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K . The following table and related discussion present sales and trading revenue, substantially all of which is in Global Markets, with the remainder in Global Banking . In addition, the following table and related discussion present sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information on net DVA, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 6 . Sales and Trading Revenue (1, 2) Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 (Dollars in millions) 2018 2017 2018 2017 Sales and trading revenue Fixed-income, currencies and commodities $ 2,106 $ 2,106 $ 4,720 $ 4,916 Equities 1,311 1,104 2,814 2,193 Total sales and trading revenue $ 3,417 $ 3,210 $ 7,534 $ 7,109 Sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA (3) Fixed-income, currencies and commodities $ 2,290 $ 2,254 $ 4,826 $ 5,184 Equities 1,306 1,115 2,823 2,214 Total sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA $ 3,596 $ 3,369 $ 7,649 $ 7,398 (1) Includes FTE adjustments of $80 million and $148 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $51 million and $100 million for the same periods in 2017 . For more information on sales and trading revenue, see Note 3 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . (2) Includes Global Banking sales and trading revenue of $75 million and $241 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $56 million and $114 million for the same periods in 2017 . (3) FICC and Equities sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, is a non-GAAP financial measure. FICC net DVA losses were $184 million and $106 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to losses of $148 million and $268 million for the same periods in 2017 . Equities net DVA gains were $5 million and losses were $9 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to losses of $11 million and $21 million for the same periods in 2017 . The following explanations for period-over-period changes in sales and trading, FICC and Equities revenue exclude net DVA, but would be the same whether net DVA was included or excluded. Three Months Ended June 30, 2018 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2017 FICC revenue increased $36 million primarily due to improved performance in macro-related products, partially offset by weakness in credit products. Equities revenue increased $191 million driven by increased client activity in financing and derivatives. Six Months Ended June 30, 2018 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2017 FICC revenue decreased $358 million primarily due to lower activity and a less favorable market in credit-related products. The decline in FICC revenue was also impacted by higher funding costs, which were driven by increases in market interest rates. Equities revenue increased $609 million driven by increased client activity in financing and derivatives and a strong trading performance in derivatives in the more volatile market environment.

Average allocated assets were $519.6 billion and $517.1 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $521.8 billion and $521.9 billion for the same periods in 2017 , and period-end allocated assets were $522.2 billion and $520.4 billion at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 . n/m = not meaningful All Other consists of ALM activities, equity investments, non-core mortgage loans and servicing activities, the net impact of periodic revisions to the MSR valuation model for core and non-core MSRs and the related economic hedge results, liquidating businesses and residual expense allocations. For more information about All Other , see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K . The Corporation classifies consumer real estate loans as core or non-core based on loan and customer characteristics. For more information on the core and non-core portfolios, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 29 . Residential mortgage loans that are held for ALM purposes, including interest rate or liquidity risk management, are classified as core and are presented on the balance sheet of All Other . During the six months ended June 30, 2018 , residential mortgage loans held for ALM activities decreased $2.4 billion to $26.1 billion at June 30, 2018 primarily as a result of payoffs and paydowns. Non-core residential mortgage and home equity loans, which are principally run-off portfolios, are also held in All Other . During the six months ended June 30, 2018 , total non-core loans decreased $5.8 billion to $35.5 billion at June 30, 2018 due primarily to payoffs and paydowns, as well as loan sales of $2.1 billion. Three Months Ended June 30, 2018 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2017 The net loss for All Other improved $98 million to a loss of $247 million driven by an income tax benefit in the current period, partially offset by a higher pretax loss. Revenue decreased $1.2 billion to a $300 million loss primarily due to a prior-year $793 million pretax gain recognized in connection with the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business and, in the current-year period, a negative impact from a $729 million charge related to the redemption of certain trust preferred securities, partially offset by a $572 million gain from the sale of primarily non-core mortgage loans. The benefit in provision for credit losses declined $54 million to $105 million due to a slowing pace of portfolio improvement in consumer real estate. Noninterest expense decreased $756 million to $619 million due to lower non-core mortgage costs and reduced operational costs from the sale of the non-U.S consumer credit card business. Also, the prior-year period included a $295 million impairment charge related to certain data centers. The income tax benefit was $567 million compared to income tax expense of $5 million . The prior year included tax expense of $690 million related to the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business. Both periods included income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking . Six Months Ended June 30, 2018 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2017 The net loss for All Other improved $166 million to a loss of $533 million , reflecting a higher income tax benefit, partially offset by a higher pretax loss. Revenue decreased $1.4 billion to $633 million primarily driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion. Gains on sales of loans, including the sale of non-core mortgage loans, nonperforming and other delinquent loans, were $636 million compared to $44 million. The benefit in provision for credit losses improved $72 million to $257 million primarily driven by the impact of the sale of the non U.S. consumer credit card business during the second quarter of 2017. Noninterest expense decreased $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion due to the same factors as described in the three-month discussion. 21 Bank of America The income tax benefit was $1.4 billion compared to a benefit of $1.1 billion in the same period in 2017. The prior-year period included $690 million in tax expense as described in the three-month discussion. Both periods included income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking . Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have contractual obligations to make future payments on debt and lease agreements. Additionally, in the normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements whereby we commit to future purchases of products or services from unaffiliated parties. For more information on obligations and commitments, see Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein as well as Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations in the MD&A, Note 11 Long-term Debt and Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K .

Managing Risk Risk is inherent in all our business activities. The seven key types of risk faced by the Corporation are strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. Sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver for our shareholders. If not managed well, risks can result in financial loss, regulatory sanctions and penalties, and damage to our reputation, each of which may adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategies. The Corporation takes a comprehensive approach to risk management with a defined Risk Framework and an articulated Risk Appetite Statement which are approved annually by the Enterprise Risk Committee and the Board. Our Risk Framework is the foundation for comprehensive management of the risks facing the Corporation. The Risk Framework sets forth clear roles, responsibilities and accountability for the management of risk and provides a blueprint for how the Board, through delegation of authority to committees and executive officers, establishes risk appetite and associated limits for our activities. Our Risk Appetite Statement is intended to ensure that the Corporation maintains an acceptable risk profile by providing a common framework and a comparable set of measures for senior management and the Board to clearly indicate the level of risk the Corporation is willing to accept. Risk appetite is set at least annually and is aligned with the Corporation strategic, capital and financial operating plans. Our line of business strategies and risk appetite are also similarly aligned. For more information on our risk management activities, including our Risk Framework, and the key types of risk faced by the Corporation, see the Managing Risk through Reputational Risk sections in the MD&A of the Corporation 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Capital Management The Corporation manages its capital position so its capital is more than adequate to support its business activities and to maintain capital, risk and risk appetite commensurate with one another. Additionally, we seek to maintain safety and soundness at all times, even under adverse scenarios, take advantage of organic growth opportunities, meet obligations to creditors and counterparties, maintain ready access to financial markets, continue to serve as a credit intermediary, remain a source of strength for our subsidiaries, and satisfy current and future regulatory capital requirements. Capital management is integrated into our risk and governance processes, as capital is a key consideration in the development of our strategic plan, risk appetite and risk limits. We periodically review capital allocated to our businesses and allocate capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. For more information, see Business Segment Operations on page 11 . CCAR and Capital Planning The Federal Reserve requires BHCs to submit a capital plan and requests for capital actions on an annual basis, consistent with the rules governing the CCAR capital plan. On June 28, 2018, following the Federal Reserve non-objection to our 2018 CCAR capital plan, the Board authorized the repurchase of approximately $ 20.6 billion in common stock from July 1, 2018 through June 30, 2019, which includes approximately $ 600 million in repurchases to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans during the same period. The repurchase program, which covers both common stock and warrants, will be subject to various factors, including the Corporation capital position, liquidity, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock trading price and general market conditions, and may be suspended at any time. The repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including repurchase plans that satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. As a well-capitalized BHC, we may notify the Federal Reserve of our intention to make additional capital distributions not to exceed 0.25 percent of Tier 1 capital, and which were not contemplated in our capital plan, subject to the Federal Reserve non-objection. Regulatory Capital As a financial services holding company, we are subject to regulatory capital rules issued by U.S. banking regulators including Basel 3. The Corporation and its primary affiliated banking entity, BANA, are Basel 3 Advanced approaches institutions and are required to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and risk-weighted assets under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is used to assess capital adequacy including under the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. As of June 30, 2018, Common equity tier 1 (CET1) and Tier 1 capital ratios were lower under the Standardized approach whereas Advanced approaches yielded a Bank of America 22 lower Total capital ratio. For more information on Basel 3, see Capital Management in the MD&A of the Corporation 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Minimum Capital Requirements Minimum capital requirements and related buffers are being phased in from January 1, 2014 through January 1, 2019. The PCA framework establishes categories of capitalization including well capitalized, based on the Basel 3 regulatory ratio requirements. U.S. banking regulators are required to take certain mandatory actions depending on the category of capitalization, with no mandatory actions required for well-capitalized banking organizations. We are subject to a capital conservation buffer, a countercyclical capital buffer and a global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge that are being phased in over a three-year period ending January 1, 2019. Once fully phased-in, the Corporation risk-based capital ratio requirements will include a capital conservation buffer greater than 2.5 percent, plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer and a G-SIB surcharge in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. The buffers and surcharge must be comprised solely of CET1 capital. Under the phase-in provisions, we are required to maintain a capital conservation buffer greater than 1.875 percent plus a G-SIB surcharge of 1.875 percent in 2018 . The countercyclical capital buffer is currently set at zero. We estimate that our fully phased-in G-SIB surcharge will be 2.5 percent. The G-SIB surcharge may differ from this estimate over time. Effective January 1, 2018, the Corporation is required to maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Our insured depository institution subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be considered well capitalized under the PCA framework. For more information on the Corporation capital ratios and regulatory requirements, see Table 9. Capital Composition and Ratios Table 9 presents Bank of America Corporation capital ratios and related information in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced approaches as measured at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 . As of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 , the Corporation met the definition of well capitalized under current regulatory requirements.

Prior periods are presented on a fully phased-in basis. (2) The June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 amounts include a transition capital conservation buffer of 1.875 percent and 1.25 percent and a transition G-SIB surcharge of 1.875 percent and 1.5 percent . The countercyclical capital buffer for both periods is zero . (3) The 2019 regulatory minimums include a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent and G-SIB surcharge of 2.5 percent . The countercyclical capital buffer is zero . We will be subject to regulatory minimums on January 1, 2019. The SLR minimum includes a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent and was applicable beginning on January 1, 2018. (4) Total capital under the Advanced approaches differs from the Standardized approach due to differences in the amount permitted in Tier 2 capital related to the qualifying allowance for credit losses. (5) Reflects adjusted average total assets for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 . 23 Bank of America CET1 capital was $164.9 billion at June 30, 2018 , a decrease of $3.6 billion from December 31, 2017 , driven by common stock repurchases, market value declines included in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) and dividends, partially offset by earnings. During the six months ended June 30, 2018 , Total capital under the Advanced approaches decreased $3.3 billion driven by the same factors as CET1. Standardized risk-weighted assets, which yielded the lower CET1 ratio for June 30, 2018 , remained relatively unchanged from December 31, 2017 . Table 10 shows the capital composition at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 .

Bank of America 24 Regulatory Developments The following supplements the disclosure in Capital Management Regulatory Developments in the MD&A of the Corporation 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Minimum Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity The Federal Reserve final rule, which is effective January 1, 2019, includes minimum external total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) and long-term debt requirements to improve the resolvability and resiliency of large, interconnected BHCs. As of June 30, 2018 , the Corporation TLAC and long-term debt exceeded our estimated 2019 minimum requirements. Stress Buffer Requirements On April 10, 2018, the Federal Reserve announced a proposal to integrate the annual quantitative assessment of the CCAR program with the buffer requirements in the Basel 3 capital rule by introducing stress buffer requirements as a replacement of the CCAR quantitative objection. Under the Standardized approach, the proposal replaces the existing static 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer with a stress capital buffer, calculated as the decrease in the CET1 capital ratio in the supervisory severely adverse scenario of the modified CCAR stress test plus four quarters of planned common stock dividend payments, floored at 2.5 percent. The static 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer would be retained under the Advanced approaches. The proposal also introduces a stress leverage buffer requirement which would be calculated as the decrease in the Tier 1 leverage ratio in the supervisory severely adverse scenario of the modified CCAR stress test plus four quarters of planned common stock dividends, with no floor. The SLR would not incorporate a stress buffer requirement. The proposal also updates the capital distribution assumptions used in the CCAR stress test to better align with a firm expected actions in stress, notably removing the assumption that a BHC will carry out all of its planned capital actions under stress. If finalized, the proposal would be effective December 31, 2018, with the first stress buffer requirements generally becoming effective on October 1, 2019. Enhanced Supplementary Leverage Ratio Requirements On April 11, 2018, the Federal Reserve and OCC announced a proposal to modify the enhanced SLR standards applicable to U.S. G-SIBs and their insured depository institution subsidiaries. The proposal replaces the existing 2.0 percent leverage buffer with a leverage buffer tailored to each G-SIB, set at 50 percent of the applicable G-SIB surcharge. This proposal also replaces the current 6.0 percent threshold at which a G-SIB insured depository institution subsidiaries are considered well capitalized under the PCA framework with a threshold set at 3.0 percent plus 50 percent of the G-SIB surcharge applicable to the subsidiary G-SIB holding company. Correspondingly, the proposal updates the external TLAC leverage buffer for each G-SIB to 50 percent of the applicable G-SIB surcharge and revises the leverage component of the minimum long-term debt requirements to be 2.5 percent plus 50 percent of the applicable G-SIB surcharge. Revisions to Basel 3 to Address Current Expected Credit Loss Accounting On April 13, 2018, the U.S. banking regulators announced a proposal to address the regulatory capital impact of using the current expected credit loss methodology to measure credit reserves under a new accounting standard which is effective on January 1, 2020. For more information on this standard, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements . The proposal provides an option to phase-in the impact to regulatory capital over a three-year period on a straight-line basis. It also updates the existing regulatory capital framework by creating a new defined term, allowance for credit losses, which would include credit losses on all financial instruments measured at amortized cost with the exception of purchased credit-impaired assets. The proposal continues to allow a limited amount of credit losses to be recognized in Tier 2 capital and maintains the existing limits under the Standardized and Advanced approaches. Single-Counterparty Credit Limits On June 14, 2018, the Federal Reserve published a final rule establishing single-counterparty credit limits (SCCL) for BHCs with total consolidated assets of $250 billion or more. The SCCL rule is designed to ensure that the maximum possible loss that a BHC could incur due to the default of a single counterparty or a group of connected counterparties would not endanger the BHC survival, thereby reducing the probability of future financial crises. Beginning January 1, 2020, G-SIBs must calculate SCCL on a daily basis by dividing the aggregate net credit exposure to a given counterparty by the G-SIB Tier 1 capital, ensuring that exposures to other G-SIBs and nonbank financial institutions regulated by the Federal Reserve do not breach 15 percent of Tier 1 capital and exposures to most other counterparties do not breach 25 percent of Tier 1 capital. Certain exposures, including exposures to the U.S. government, U.S. government-sponsored entities and qualifying central counterparties, are exempt from the credit limits. Broker-dealer Regulatory Capital and Securities Regulation The Corporation principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (MLPF&S) and Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp (MLPCC). MLPCC is a fully-guaranteed subsidiary of MLPF&S and provides clearing and settlement services. Both entities are subject to the net capital requirements of Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c3-1. Both entities are also registered as futures commission merchants and are subject to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Regulation 1.17. MLPF&S has elected to compute the minimum capital requirement in accordance with the Alternative Net Capital Requirement as permitted by SEC Rule 15c3-1. At June 30, 2018 , MLPF&S regulatory net capital as defined by Rule 15c3-1 was $13.5 billion and exceeded the minimum requirement of $1.8 billion by $11.7 billion. MLPCC net capital of $4.5 billion exceeded the minimum requirement of $546 million by $3.9 billion. In accordance with the Alternative Net Capital Requirements, MLPF&S is required to maintain tentative net capital in excess of $1.0 billion, net capital in excess of $500 million and notify the SEC in the event its tentative net capital is less than $5.0 billion. At June 30, 2018 , MLPF&S had tentative net capital and net capital in excess of the minimum and notification requirements. Merrill Lynch International (MLI), a U.K. investment firm, is regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority, and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. At June 30, 2018 , MLI capital resources were $35.0 billion, which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $14.7 billion. 25 Bank of America Liquidity Risk Funding and Liquidity Risk Management Our primary liquidity risk management objective is to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral needs while continuing to support our businesses and customers under a range of economic conditions. To achieve that objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk under expected and stressed conditions, maintain liquidity and access to diverse funding sources, including our stable deposit base, and seek to align liquidity-related incentives and risks. We define liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we can use to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations as those obligations arise. We manage our liquidity position through line of business and ALM activities, as well as through our legal entity funding strategy, on both a forward and current (including intraday) basis under both expected and stressed conditions. We believe that a centralized approach to funding and liquidity management enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding sources, minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events. For more information regarding global funding and liquidity risk management, as well as our liquidity sources, liquidity arrangements, contingency planning and credit ratings discussed below, see Liquidity Risk in the MD&A of the Corporation 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K . NB Holdings Corporation We have intercompany arrangements with certain key subsidiaries under which we transferred certain of our parent company assets, and agreed to transfer certain additional parent company assets not needed to satisfy anticipated near-term expenditures, to NB Holdings Corporation, a wholly-owned holding company subsidiary (NB Holdings). The parent company is expected to continue to have access to the same flow of dividends, interest and other amounts of cash necessary to service its debt, pay dividends and perform other obligations as it would have had if it had not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets. These arrangements support our preferred single point of entry resolution strategy, under which only the parent company would be resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Global Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets Table 13 presents our average global liquidity sources (GLS) for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 . Table 13 Average Global Liquidity Sources Three Months Ended (Dollars in billions) June 30 2018 December 31 2017 Parent company and NB Holdings $ 74 $ 79 Bank subsidiaries 393 394 Other regulated entities 45 49 Total Average Global Liquidity Sources $ 512 $ 522 We maintain liquidity available to the Corporation, including the parent company and selected subsidiaries, in the form of cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Typically, parent company and NB Holdings liquidity is in the form of cash deposited with BANA. Our bank subsidiaries liquidity is primarily driven by deposit and lending activity, as well as securities valuation and net debt activity. Liquidity at bank subsidiaries excludes the cash deposited by the parent company and NB Holdings. Our bank subsidiaries can also generate incremental liquidity by pledging a range of unencumbered loans and securities to certain FHLBs and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against this pool of specifically-identified eligible assets was $311 billion and $308 billion at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 . We have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against these assets, including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loans and securities collateral. Eligibility is defined in guidelines from the FHLBs and the Federal Reserve and is subject to change at their discretion. Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries can generally be used only to fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries, and transfers to the parent company or nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to prior regulatory approval. Liquidity held in other regulated entities, comprised primarily of broker-dealer subsidiaries, is primarily available to meet the obligations of that entity and transfers to the parent company or to any other subsidiary may be subject to prior regulatory approval due to regulatory restrictions and minimum requirements. Our other regulated entities also hold unencumbered investment-grade securities and equities that we believe could be used to generate additional liquidity. Table 14 presents the composition of average GLS for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 . Table 14 Average Global Liquidity Sources Composition Three Months Ended (Dollars in billions) June 30 2018 December 31 2017 Cash on deposit $ 130 $ 118 U.S. Treasury securities 60 62 U.S. agency securities and mortgage-backed securities 312 330 Non-U.S. government securities 10 12 Total Average Global Liquidity Sources $ 512 $ 522 Our GLS are substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the final U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) rules. However, HQLA for purposes of calculating LCR is not reported at market value, but at a lower value that incorporates regulatory deductions and the exclusion of excess liquidity held at certain subsidiaries. The LCR is calculated as the amount of a financial institution unencumbered HQLA relative to the estimated net cash outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period of significant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. Our average consolidated HQLA, on a net basis, was $434 billion and $439 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 . For the same periods, the average consolidated LCR was 122 percent and 125 percent. Our LCR will fluctuate due to normal business flows from customer activity. Bank of America 26 Liquidity Stress Analysis and Time-to-required Funding We utilize liquidity stress analysis to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our subsidiaries to meet contractual and contingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios. For more information on our liquidity stress analysis, see Liquidity Risk Liquidity Stress Analysis and Time-to-required Funding in the MD&A of the Corporation 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K . We use a variety of metrics to determine the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our subsidiaries. One metric we use to evaluate the appropriate level of liquidity at the parent company and NB Holdings is time-to-required funding (TTF). This debt coverage measure indicates the number of months the parent company can continue to meet its unsecured contractual obligations as they come due using only the parent company and NB Holdings liquidity sources without issuing any new debt or accessing any additional liquidity sources. We define unsecured contractual obligations for purposes of this metric as maturities of senior or subordinated debt issued or guaranteed by Bank of America Corporation. These include certain unsecured debt instruments, primarily structured liabilities, which we may be required to settle for cash prior to maturity. TTF was 60 months at June 30, 2018 compared to 49 months at December 31, 2017 . The increase in TTF was driven by lower contractual debt maturities. Diversified Funding Sources We fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits, and secured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally coordinated funding approach diversified across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups. We fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposits, which were $1.31 trillion at both June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 . Our trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded on a secured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions. During the six months ended June 30, 2018 , we issued $42.5 billion of long-term debt consisting of $23.3 billion for Bank of America Corporation, substantially all of which was TLAC compliant, $12.5 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $6.7 billion of other debt. On April 30, 2018, we announced that we submitted redemption notices for 11 series of trust preferred securities with a total carrying value of $3.1 billion , resulting in the redemption of such trust preferred securities along with the applicable trust common securities (held by the Corporation or its affiliates) on June 6, 2018. Upon redemption of the trust preferred securities and the extinguishment of the related junior subordinated notes issued by the Corporation, we recorded a charge to other income of $729 million . Table 15 presents the carrying value of aggregate annual contractual maturities of long-term debt at June 30, 2018 . During the six months ended June 30, 2018 , we had total long-term debt contractual and non-contractual maturities of $36.5 billion consisting of $23.5 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $5.9 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $7.1 billion of other debt.

Table 16 Long-term Debt by Major Currency (Dollars in millions) June 30 2018 December 31 2017 U.S. dollar $ 174,430 $ 175,623 Euro 36,440 35,481 British pound 5,604 7,016 Canadian dollar 2,994 1,966 Australian dollar 2,943 3,046 Japanese yen 2,933 2,993 Other 1,251 1,277 Total long-term debt $ 226,595 $ 227,402 Total long-term debt decreased $807 million during the six months ended June 30, 2018 , due to maturities, including the redemption of the trust preferred securities, changes in the fair value of hedged debt and revaluation of non-U.S. debt, partially offset by issuances. We may, from time to time, purchase outstanding debt instruments in various transactions, depending on market conditions, liquidity and other factors. In addition, our other regulated entities may make markets in our debt instruments to provide liquidity for investors. For information on funding and liquidity risk management, see Liquidity Risk Liquidity Stress Analysis and Time-to-required Funding on page 27 , and for more information regarding long-term debt funding, see Note 11 Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K . We use derivative transactions to manage the duration, interest rate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering the characteristics of the assets they are funding. For more information on our ALM activities, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 50 . We may also issue unsecured debt in the form of structured notes for client purposes, certain of which qualify as TLAC eligible debt. During the six months ended June 30, 2018 , we issued $3.3 billion of structured notes, which are debt obligations that pay investors returns linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these liabilities with derivatives and/or investments in the underlying instruments, so that from a funding perspective, the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We could be required to settle certain structured note obligations for cash or other securities prior to maturity under certain circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning purposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date. Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price. Credit Ratings Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating agencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other securities, including asset securitizations. Table 17 presents the Corporation current long-term/short-term senior debt ratings and outlooks expressed by the rating agencies. On June 21, 2018, Fitch Ratings (Fitch) upgraded the Corporation long-term senior debt rating to A+ from A as part of the agency latest review of 12 Global Trading & Investment Banks, citing our sustained and improved risk-adjusted earnings, lower risk appetite relative to peers, overall franchise strength and solid liquidity position. The Corporation short-term debt rating of F1 was affirmed. Additionally, Fitch upgraded the long- and short-term debt ratings of the Corporation rated U.S. subsidiaries, including BANA and MLPF&S, and upgraded the long-term debt ratings of our rated international subsidiaries, including MLI. The outlook at Fitch remains stable for all long-term debt ratings. The ratings from Standard & Poor Global Ratings and Moody Investors Service have not changed from those disclosed in the Corporation 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information on the additional collateral and termination payments that could be required in connection with certain over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts and other trading agreements as a result of a credit rating downgrade, see Note 3 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein and Item 1A.

Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Credit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower credit cycle. Statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio management including underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting credit limits, and establishing operating processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns. Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources such as credit bureaus and/or internal historical experience and are a component of our consumer credit risk management process. These models are used in part to assist in making both new and ongoing credit decisions, as well as portfolio management strategies, including authorizations and line management, collection practices and strategies, and determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allocated capital for credit risk. Consumer Credit Portfolio Improvement in home prices continued during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 resulting in improved credit quality and lower credit losses in the home equity portfolio, partially offset by seasoning and loan growth in the U.S. credit card portfolio compared to the same periods in 2017 . Improved credit quality and continued loan balance run-off in the consumer real estate portfolio, partially offset by seasoning within the U.S. credit card portfolio, drove a $243 million decrease in the consumer allowance for loan and lease losses during the six months ended June 30, 2018 to $5.1 billion at June 30, 2018 . For additional information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 45 . For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, charge-offs and troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) for the consumer portfolio, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Table 18 presents our outstanding consumer loans and leases, consumer nonperforming loans and accruing consumer loans past due 90 days or more. Nonperforming loans do not include past due consumer credit card loans, other unsecured loans and in general, consumer loans not secured by real estate (bankruptcy loans are included) as these loans are typically charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due. Real estate-secured past due consumer loans that are insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or individually insured under long-term standby agreements with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (collectively, the fully-insured loan portfolio) are reported as accruing as opposed to nonperforming since the principal repayment is insured. Fully-insured loans included in accruing past due 90 days or more are primarily from our repurchases of delinquent FHA loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA). Additionally, nonperforming loans and accruing balances past due 90 days or more do not include the PCI loan portfolio or loans accounted for under the fair value option even though the customer may be contractually past due. For more information on PCI loans, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio on page 35 and Note 5 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements .

Net charge-off ratios including the PCI write-offs were 0.04 percent and 0.03 percent for residential mortgage and 0.17 percent and 0.27 percent for home equity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to 0.04 percent and 0.05 percent for residential mortgage and 0.41 percent and 0.48 percent for home equity for the same periods in 2017 . For additional information on PCI write-offs, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio on page 35 . Table 20 presents outstandings, nonperforming balances, net charge-offs, allowance for loan and lease losses and provision for loan and lease losses for the core and non-core portfolios within the consumer real estate portfolio. We categorize consumer real estate loans as core and non-core based on loan and customer characteristics such as origination date, product type, loan-to-value (LTV), Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score and delinquency status consistent with our current consumer and mortgage servicing strategy. Generally, loans that were originated after January 1, 2010, qualified under government-sponsored enterprise underwriting guidelines, or otherwise met our underwriting guidelines in place in 2015 are characterized as core loans. All other loans are generally characterized as non-core loans and represent run-off portfolios. Core loans as reported in Table 20 include loans held in the Consumer Banking and GWIM segments, as well as loans held for ALM activities in All Other . For more information, see Note 5 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements . As shown in Table 20 , outstanding core consumer real estate loans increased $5.3 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2018 driven by an increase of $8.0 billion in residential mortgage, partially offset by a $2.7 billion decrease in home equity.

For more information, see Note 15 Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements . (2) Net charge-offs exclude write-offs in the PCI loan portfolio. For more information, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio on page 35 . We believe that the presentation of information adjusted to exclude the impact of the PCI loan portfolio, the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option is more representative of the ongoing operations and credit quality of the business. As a result, in the following tables and discussions of the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios, we exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option and provide information that excludes the impact of the PCI loan portfolio and the fully-insured loan portfolio in certain credit quality statistics. We separately disclose information on the PCI loan portfolio on page 35 . Residential Mortgage The residential mortgage portfolio made up the largest percentage of our consumer loan portfolio at 46 percent of consumer loans and leases at June 30, 2018 . At June 30, 2018 , 41 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio was in Consumer Banking and 36 percent was in GWIM. The remaining portion was in All Other and was comprised of originated loans, purchased loans used in our overall ALM activities, delinquent FHA loans repurchased pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA as well as loans repurchased related to our representations and warranties. Outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio increased $3.8 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2018 as retention of new originations was partially offset by loan sales of $2.6 billion and run-off. At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 , the residential mortgage portfolio included $21.5 billion and $23.7 billion of outstanding fully-insured loans. At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 , $15.5 billion and $17.4 billion had FHA insurance with the remainder protected by long-term standby agreements. At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 , $4.3 billion and $5.2 billion of the FHA-insured loan population were repurchases of delinquent FHA loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA. 31 Bank of America Table 21 presents certain residential mortgage key credit statistics on both a reported basis and excluding the PCI loan portfolio and the fully-insured loan portfolio. Additionally, in the Reported Basis columns in the following table, accruing balances past due and nonperforming loans do not include the PCI loan portfolio, in accordance with our accounting policies, even though the customer may be contractually past due. As such, the following discussion presents the residential mortgage portfolio excluding the PCI loan portfolio and the fully-insured loan portfolio. For more information on the PCI loan portfolio, see page 35 . Table 21 Residential Mortgage Key Credit Statistics Reported Basis (1) Excluding Purchased Credit-impaired and Fully-insured Loans (1) (Dollars in millions) June 30 2018 December 31 2017 June 30 2018 December 31 2017 Outstandings $ 207,564 $ 203,811 $ 178,813 $ 172,069 Accruing past due 30 days or more 4,717 5,987 1,262 1,521 Accruing past due 90 days or more 2,483 3,230 Nonperforming loans 2,140 2,476 2,140 2,476 Percent of portfolio Refreshed LTV greater than 90 but less than or equal to 100 2 % 3 % 2 % 2 % Refreshed LTV greater than 100 2 2 1 1 Refreshed FICO below 620 5 6 2 3 2006 and 2007 vintages (2) 8 10 7 8 Reported Basis Excluding Purchased Credit-impaired and Fully-insured Loans Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 Net charge-off ratio (3) 0.01 % (0.04 )% % % 0.01 % (0.05 )% % % (1) Outstandings, accruing past due, nonperforming loans and percentages of portfolio exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. (2) These vintages of loans accounted for $649 million , or 30 percent , and $825 million or 33 percent , of nonperforming residential mortgage loans at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 . (3) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as annualized net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option. Nonperforming residential mortgage loans decreased $336 million during the six months ended June 30, 2018 driven by sales of $339 million. Of the nonperforming residential mortgage loans at June 30, 2018 , $792 million, or 37 percent, were current on contractual payments. Loans accruing past due 30 days or more decreased $259 million due to seasonal declines. Net charge-offs increased $26 million to $7 million and increased $3 million to $1 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017 primarily due to lower recoveries. During the three months ended June 30, 2018 , we sold primarily non-core residential mortgage loans with a carrying value of $1.2 billion , previously transferred to held for sale, and recognized a gain of $572 million that was recorded in other income. The sale of these loans in part drove the lower recoveries during the three months ended June 30, 2018 . Loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent represented one percent of the residential mortgage loan portfolio at both June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 . Of the loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent, 99 percent were performing at June 30, 2018 compared to 98 percent at December 31, 2017 . Loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent reflect loans where the outstanding carrying value of the loan is greater than the most recent valuation of the property securing the loan. The majority of these loans have a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent due to home price deterioration since 2006, partially offset by subsequent appreciation. Of the $178.8 billion in total residential mortgage loans outstanding at June 30, 2018 , as shown in Table 22 , 31 percent were originated as interest-only loans. The outstanding balance of interest-only residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period was $10.2 billion, or 18 percent, at June 30, 2018 . Residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period generally have experienced a higher rate of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status compared to the residential mortgage portfolio as a whole. At June 30, 2018 , $280 million, or three percent, of outstanding interest-only residential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $1.3 billion , or one percent , for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, at June 30, 2018 , $438 million, or four percent, of outstanding interest-only residential mortgage loans that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming, of which $166 million were contractually current, compared to $2.1 billion , or one percent , for the entire residential mortgage portfolio, of which $792 million were contractually current. Loans that have yet to enter the amortization period in our interest-only residential mortgage portfolio are primarily well-collateralized loans to our wealth management clients and have an interest-only period of three to ten years. More than 90 percent of these loans that have yet to enter the amortization period will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2020 or later. Bank of America 32 Table 22 presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the residential mortgage portfolio. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) within California represented 16 percent of outstandings at both June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 . In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 13 percent of outstandings at both June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 .

For more information on PCI write-offs, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio on page 35 . (3) In these states, foreclosure requires a court order following a legal proceeding (judicial states). (4) Amounts exclude the PCI residential mortgage and fully-insured loan portfolios. (5) At both June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 , 47 percent of PCI residential mortgage loans were in California. There were no other significant single state concentrations. Home Equity At June 30, 2018 , the home equity portfolio made up 12 percent of the consumer portfolio and is comprised of home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), home equity loans and reverse mortgages. At June 30, 2018 , our HELOC portfolio had an outstanding balance of $47.5 billion, or 89 percent of the total home equity portfolio, compared to $51.2 billion, or 89 percent, at December 31, 2017 . HELOCs generally have an initial draw period of 10 years, and after the initial draw period ends, the loans generally convert to 15-year amortizing loans. At June 30, 2018 , our home equity loan portfolio had an outstanding balance of $3.8 billion, or seven percent of the total home equity portfolio, compared to $4.4 billion, or seven percent, at December 31, 2017 . Home equity loans are almost all fixed-rate loans with amortizing payment terms of 10 to 30 years, and of the $3.8 billion at June 30, 2018 , 58 percent have 25- to 30-year terms. At June 30, 2018 , our reverse mortgage portfolio had an outstanding balance of $2.3 billion, or four percent of the total home equity portfolio, compared to $2.1 billion, or four percent, at December 31, 2017 . We no longer originate reverse mortgages. At June 30, 2018 , 70 percent of the home equity portfolio was in Consumer Banking , 23 percent was in All Other and the remainder of the portfolio was primarily in GWIM . Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased $4.2 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2018 primarily due to paydowns and charge-offs outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines. Of the total home equity portfolio at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 , $18.0 billion and $18.7 billion, or 34 percent and 32 percent, were in first-lien positions (35 percent and 34 percent excluding the PCI home equity portfolio). At June 30, 2018 , outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio that were in a second-lien or more junior-lien position and where we also held the first-lien loan totaled $8.5 billion, or 17 percent of our total home equity portfolio excluding the PCI loan portfolio. Unused HELOCs totaled $43.4 billion at June 30, 2018 compared to $44.2 billion at December 31, 2017 . The decrease was primarily due to accounts reaching the end of their draw period, which automatically eliminates open line exposure, and customers choosing to close accounts. Both of these more than offset the impact of new production. The HELOC utilization rate was 52 percent and 54 percent at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 . 33 Bank of America Table 23 presents certain home equity portfolio key credit statistics on both a reported basis and excluding the PCI loan portfolio. Additionally, in the Reported Basis columns in the following table, accruing balances past due 30 days or more and nonperforming loans do not include the PCI loan portfolio, in accordance with our accounting policies, even though the customer may be contractually past due. As such, the following discussion presents the home equity portfolio excluding the PCI loan portfolio. For more information on the PCI loan portfolio, see page 35 .

(2) Accruing past due 30 days or more include $50 million and $67 million and nonperforming loans include $298 million and $344 million of loans where we serviced the underlying first lien at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 . (3) These vintages of loans have higher refreshed combined loan-to-value (CLTV) ratios and accounted for 53 percent and 52 percent of nonperforming home equity loans at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 , and $8 million and $37 million of net charge-offs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 , and $46 million and $103 million for the same periods in 2017. (4) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as annualized net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option. Nonperforming outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased $192 million during the six months ended June 30, 2018 as outflows, including $47 million of sales, outpaced new inflows. Of the nonperforming home equity portfolio at June 30, 2018 , $1.3 billion, or 55 percent, were current on contractual payments. Nonperforming loans that are contractually current primarily consist of collateral-dependent TDRs, including those that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, junior-lien loans where the underlying first lien is 90 days or more past due, as well as loans that have not yet demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance following a TDR. In addition, $653 million, or 27 percent, of nonperforming home equity loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell. Accruing loans that were 30 days or more past due decreased $75 million during the six months ended June 30, 2018 . In some cases, the junior-lien home equity outstanding balance that we hold is performing, but the underlying first lien is not. For outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio on which we service the first-lien loan, we are able to track whether the first-lien loan is in default. For loans where the first lien is serviced by a third party, we utilize credit bureau data to estimate the delinquency status of the first lien. For certain loans, we utilize a third-party vendor to combine credit bureau and public record data to better link a junior-lien loan with the underlying first-lien loan. At June 30, 2018 , we estimate that $728 million of current and $112 million of 30 to 89 days past due junior-lien loans were behind a delinquent first-lien loan. We service the first-lien loans on $144 million of these combined amounts, with the remaining $696 million serviced by third parties. Of the $840 million of current to 89 days past due junior-lien loans, based on available credit bureau data and our own internal servicing data, we estimate that approximately $266 million had first-lien loans that were 90 days or more past due. Net charge-offs decreased $50 million to $0 and $81 million to $33 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017 driven by favorable portfolio trends due in part to improvement in home prices and the U.S. economy. Outstanding balances with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent comprised four percent of the home equity portfolio at both June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 . Outstanding balances with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent reflect loans where our loan and available line of credit combined with any outstanding senior liens against the property are equal to or greater than the most recent valuation of the property securing the loan. Depending on the value of the property, there may be collateral in excess of the first lien that is available to reduce the severity of loss on the second lien. Of those outstanding balances with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent, 95 percent of the customers were current on their home equity loan and 91 percent of second-lien loans with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent were current on both their second-lien and underlying first-lien loans at June 30, 2018 . Of the $51.2 billion in total home equity portfolio outstandings at June 30, 2018 , as shown in Table 24 , 23 percent require interest-only payments. The outstanding balance of HELOCs that have reached the end of their draw period and have entered the amortization period was $18.0 billion at June 30, 2018 . The HELOCs that have entered the amortization period have experienced a higher percentage of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status when compared to the HELOC portfolio as a whole. At June 30, 2018 , $315 million, or two percent, of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more. In addition, at June 30, 2018 , $2.1 billion, or 11 percent, of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming, of which $1.2 billion were contractually current. Loans in our HELOC portfolio Bank of America 34 generally have an initial draw period of 10 years and three percent of these loans will enter the amortization period during the remainder of 2018 and will be required to make fully-amortizing payments. We communicate to contractually current customers more than a year prior to the end of their draw period to inform them of the potential change to the payment structure before entering the amortization period, and provide payment options to customers prior to the end of the draw period. Although we do not actively track how many of our home equity customers pay only the minimum amount due on their home equity loans and lines, we can infer some of this information through a review of our HELOC portfolio that we service and that is still in its revolving period (i.e., customers may draw on and repay their line of credit, but are generally only required to pay interest on a monthly basis). During the three months ended June 30, 2018 , 27 percent of these customers with an outstanding balance did not pay any principal on their HELOCs. Table 24 presents outstandings, nonperforming balances and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the home equity portfolio. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 13 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 . For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 , loans within this MSA contributed $5 million and $16 million of net charge-offs within the home equity portfolio compared to $15 million and $28 million for the same periods in 2017 . The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California made up 11 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 . For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 , loans within this MSA contributed net recoveries of $6 million and $11 million within the home equity portfolio compared to net recoveries of $5 million and $8 million for the same periods in 2017 .

(5) For both June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 , 28 percent of PCI home equity loans were in California. There were no other significant single state concentrations. Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio Loans acquired with evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination and for which it is probable at purchase that we will be unable to collect all contractually required payments are accounted for under the accounting standards for PCI loans. For more information, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 5 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein. Table 25 presents the unpaid principal balance, carrying value, related valuation allowance and the net carrying value as a percentage of the unpaid principal balance for the PCI loan portfolio.

This includes $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion of loans that were credit-impaired upon acquisition and $102 million and $141 million of loans that were 90 days or more past due at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 . The total unpaid principal balance of pay option loans with accumulated negative amortization was $104 million and $160 million, including $5 million and $9 million of negative amortization at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 . 35 Bank of America The total PCI unpaid principal balance decreased $1.1 billion , or 11 percent , during the six months ended June 30, 2018 primarily driven by payoffs, paydowns, write-offs and PCI loan sales with a carrying value of $160 million compared to sales of $204 million for the same period in 2017 . Of the unpaid principal balance of $9.8 billion at June 30, 2018 , $8.8 billion, or 90 percent, was current based on the contractual terms, $569 million, or six percent, was in early stage delinquency, and $291 million was 180 days or more past due, including $234 million of first-lien mortgages and $57 million of home equity loans. The PCI residential mortgage loan and home equity portfolios represented 75 percent and 25 percent of the total PCI loan portfolio at June 30, 2018 . Those loans to borrowers with a refreshed FICO score below 620 represented 23 percent and 17 percent of the PCI residential mortgage loan and home equity portfolios at June 30, 2018 . Residential mortgage and home equity loans with a refreshed LTV or CLTV greater than 90 percent, after consideration of purchase accounting adjustments and the related valuation allowance, represented 13 percent and 32 percent of their respective PCI loan portfolios and 14 percent and 35 percent based on the unpaid principal balance at June 30, 2018 . U.S. Credit Card At June 30, 2018 , 97 percent of the U.S. credit card portfolio was managed in Consumer Banking with the remainder in GWIM . Outstandings in the U.S. credit card portfolio decreased $1.5 billion to $94.8 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2018 due to paydowns and a seasonal decline in purchase volume, as well as a portfolio transfer of approximately $600 million to held for sale in the first quarter. Net charge-offs increased $99 million to $739 million and $194 million to $1.4 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017 due to portfolio seasoning and loan growth. U.S. credit card loans 30 days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased $152 million during the six months ended June 30, 2018 and loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased $35 million, driven by seasonal volume declines. Unused lines of credit for U.S. credit card totaled $335.7 billion and $326.3 billion at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 . The increase was driven by a seasonal decrease in line utilization due to a decrease in transaction volume as well as account growth and lines of credit increases. Table 26 presents certain state concentrations for the U.S. credit card portfolio.

Outstandings in the direct/indirect portfolio decreased $3.7 billion to $92.6 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2018 primarily due to declines in our auto portfolio as paydowns outpaced originations and in securities-based lending due to lower draws and utilizations. Net charge-offs increased $8 million to $ 41 million and $19 million to $100 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017 due largely to portfolio seasoning. Table 27 presents certain state concentrations for the direct/indirect consumer loan portfolio.

For more information on nonperforming loans, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 5 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein. During the six months ended June 30, 2018 , nonperforming consumer loans declined $527 million to $4.6 billion primarily driven by loan sales of $386 million . At June 30, 2018 , $1.4 billion, or 31 percent, of nonperforming loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to their estimated property value less costs to sell. In addition, at June 30, 2018 , $2.2 billion, or 47 percent, of nonperforming consumer loans were modified and are now current after successful trial periods, or are current loans classified as nonperforming loans in accordance with applicable policies. Foreclosed properties increased $27 million to $263 million during the six months ended June 30, 2018 as additions outpaced liquidations. PCI loans are excluded from nonperforming loans as these loans were written down to fair value at the acquisition date; however, once we acquire the underlying real estate upon foreclosure of the delinquent PCI loan, it is included in foreclosed properties. Certain delinquent government-guaranteed loans (principally FHA-insured loans) are excluded from our nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties activity as we expect we will be reimbursed once the property is conveyed to the guarantor for principal and, up to certain limits, costs incurred during the foreclosure process and interest accrued during the holding period. We classify junior-lien home equity loans as nonperforming when the first-lien loan becomes 90 days past due even if the junior-lien loan is performing. At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 , $266 million and $330 million of such junior-lien home equity loans were included in nonperforming loans and leases. Nonperforming loans also include certain loans that have been modified in TDRs where economic concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. Nonperforming TDRs, excluding those modified loans in the PCI loan portfolio, are included in Table 28 .

(2) Consumer loans may be returned to performing status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected, or when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection. (3) At June 30, 2018 , 31 percent of nonperforming loans were 180 days or more past due. (4) Foreclosed property balances do not include properties insured by certain government-guaranteed loans, principally FHA-insured, of $573 million and $1.0 billion at June 30, 2018 and 2017 . (5) Outstanding consumer loans and leases exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. Table 29 presents TDRs for the consumer real estate portfolio. Performing TDR balances are excluded from nonperforming loans and leases in Table 28 .

(2) Residential mortgage performing TDRs included $3.2 billion and $3.7 billion of loans that were fully-insured at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 . (3) During the three months ended June 30, 2018 , previously impaired residential mortgage loans with a carrying value of $1.2 billion were sold, resulting in a gain of $572 million recorded in other income. (4) Home equity TDRs deemed collateral dependent totaled $1.6 billion and included $1.2 billion of loans classified as nonperforming at both June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 , and $381 million and $388 million of loans classified as performing. 37 Bank of America In addition to modifying consumer real estate loans, we work with customers who are experiencing financial difficulty by modifying credit card and other consumer loans. Credit card and other consumer loan modifications generally involve a reduction in the customer interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months, all of which are considered TDRs (the renegotiated TDR portfolio). Modifications of credit card and other consumer loans are made through renegotiation programs utilizing direct customer contact, but may also utilize external renegotiation programs. The renegotiated TDR portfolio is excluded in large part from Table 28 as substantially all of the loans remain on accrual status until either charged off or paid in full. At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 , our renegotiated TDR portfolio was $517 million and $490 million , of which $448 million and $426 million were current or less than 30 days past due under the modified terms. The increase in the renegotiated TDR portfolio was primarily driven by new renegotiated enrollments outpacing the run off of existing portfolios. For more information on the renegotiated TDR portfolio, see Note 5 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Commercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal that concentrations of credit exposure do not result in undesirable levels of risk. We review, measure and manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, customer relationship and loan size. We also review, measure and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property type. In addition, within our non-U.S. portfolio, we evaluate exposures by region and by country. Tables 34 , 37 and 41 summarize our concentrations. We also utilize syndications of exposure to third parties, loan sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio. For more information on our industry concentrations, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Industry Concentrations on page 42 and Table 37 . For more information on our accounting policies regarding nonperforming status, net charge-offs and delinquencies for the commercial portfolio, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Commercial Credit Portfolio During the six months ended June 30, 2018 , credit quality among large corporate borrowers was strong, and there was continued improvement in the energy portfolio. Credit quality of commercial real estate borrowers in most sectors remained stable with conservative LTV ratios, stable market rents and vacancy rates that remain low. Total commercial utilized credit exposure increased $4.3 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2018 primarily driven by increases in derivative assets and loans and leases, partially offset by decreases in LHFS. The utilization rate for loans and leases, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and financial guarantees, and commercial letters of credit, in the aggregate, was 59 percent at both June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 . Table 30 presents commercial credit exposure by type for utilized, unfunded and total binding committed credit exposure. Commercial utilized credit exposure includes SBLCs and financial guarantees and commercial letters of credit that have been issued and for which we are legally bound to advance funds under prescribed conditions during a specified time period, and excludes exposure related to trading account assets. Although funds have not yet been advanced, these exposure types are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes.

The distributed amounts were $10.7 billion and $11.0 billion at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 . (5) Includes credit risk exposure associated with assets under operating lease arrangements of $6.3 billion at both June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 . (6) Derivative assets are carried at fair value, reflect the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and have been reduced by cash collateral of $33.3 billion and $34.6 billion at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 . Not reflected in utilized and committed exposure is additional non-cash derivative collateral held of $36.1 billion and $26.2 billion at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 , which consists primarily of other marketable securities. Outstanding commercial loans and leases increased $4.8 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2018 primarily due to growth in U.S. commercial loans. The allowance for loan and lease losses for the commercial portfolio decreased $100 million to $4.9 billion at June 30, 2018 . For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 45 .

U.S. Commercial At June 30, 2018 , 69 percent of the U.S. commercial loan portfolio, excluding small business, was managed in Global Banking, 17 percent in Global Markets , 12 percent in GWIM (generally business-purpose loans for high net worth clients) and the remainder primarily in Consumer Banking . U.S. commercial loans increased $4.9 billion , or two percent , during the six months ended June 30, 2018 due to growth across most of the commercial businesses. Reservable criticized balances decreased $1.1 billion , or 11 percent , driven by broad-based improvements including the energy sector. Non-U.S. Commercial At June 30, 2018 , 81 percent of the non-U.S. commercial loan portfolio was managed in Global Banking and 19 percent in Global Markets . Outstanding loans decreased $3.3 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2018 driven by paydowns primarily in Global Markets . Nonperforming loans and leases decreased $129 million , or 43 percent , due primarily to sales. For additional information on the non-U.S. commercial portfolio, see Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 44 . Commercial Real Estate Commercial real estate primarily includes commercial loans and leases secured by non-owner-occupied real estate and is dependent on the sale or lease of the real estate as the primary source of repayment. The portfolio remains diversified across property types and geographic regions. California represented the largest state concentration at 23 percent of the commercial real estate loans and leases portfolio at both June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 . The commercial real estate portfolio is predominantly managed in Global Banking and consists of loans made primarily to public and private developers, and commercial real estate firms. Outstanding loans increased $2.8 billion , or five percent , during the six months ended June 30, 2018 to $61.1 billion due to new originations outpacing paydowns. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 , we continued to see low default rates and solid credit quality in both the residential and non-residential portfolios. We use a number of proactive risk mitigation initiatives to reduce adversely rated exposure in the commercial real estate portfolio, including transfers of deteriorating exposures to management by independent special asset officers and the pursuit of loan restructurings or asset sales to achieve the best results for our customers and the Corporation. Nonperforming commercial real estate loans and foreclosed properties decreased $26 million , or 16 percent , during the six months ended June 30, 2018 to $138 million at June 30, 2018 , and reservable criticized balances decreased $ 115 million , or 20 percent, to $451 million primarily due to loan paydowns.

U.S. Small Business Commercial The U.S. small business commercial loan portfolio is comprised of small business card loans and small business loans managed in Consumer Banking . Credit card-related products were 51 percent and 50 percent of the U.S. small business commercial portfolio at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 . Of the U.S. small business commercial net charge-offs, 92 percent and 94 percent were credit card-related products for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to 89 percent and 88 percent for the same periods in 2017 . Bank of America 40 Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity Table 35 presents the nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 . Nonperforming loans do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. During the six months ended June 30, 2018 , nonperforming commercial loans and leases decreased $46 million to $1.3 billion . At June 30, 2018 , 88 percent of commercial nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties were secured and 47 percent were contractually current. Commercial nonperforming loans were carried at 86 percent of their unpaid principal balance before consideration of the allowance for loan and lease losses as the carrying value of these loans has been reduced to the estimated property value less costs to sell.

(2) Includes U.S. small business commercial activity. Small business card loans are excluded as they are not classified as nonperforming. (3) Commercial loans and leases may be returned to performing status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected, or when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection. TDRs are generally classified as performing after a sustained period of demonstrated payment performance. (4) Outstanding commercial loans exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. Table 36 presents our commercial TDRs by product type and performing status. U.S. small business commercial TDRs are comprised of renegotiated small business card loans and small business loans. The renegotiated small business card loans are not classified as nonperforming as they are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due. For more information on TDRs, see Note 5 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements .

Our commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. Total commercial committed exposure increased $12.9 billion , or one percent, during the six months ended June 30, 2018 to $994.0 billion . The increase in commercial committed exposure was concentrated in the Asset Managers and Funds, Real Estate, Capital Goods, Materials, Commercial Services and Supplies, and Consumer Durables and Apparel industry sectors. Increases were partially offset by reduced exposure to the Food and Staples Retailing, Global Commercial Banks, Retailing, Media, and Government and Public Education industry sectors. Industry limits are used internally to manage industry concentrations and are based on committed exposure that is allocated on an industry-by-industry basis. A risk management framework is in place to set and approve industry limits as well as to provide ongoing monitoring. The Management Risk Committee oversees industry limit governance. Asset Managers and Funds, our largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $103.1 billion , increased $12.0 billion , or 13 percent , during the six months ended June 30, 2018 . The change reflects an increase in exposure to several counterparties. Real Estate, our second largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $89.4 billion , increased $5.6 billion , or seven percent , during the six months ended June 30, 2018 . For more information on the commercial real estate and related portfolios, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Commercial Real Estate on page 40 . Capital Goods, our third largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $75.1 billion , increased $4.7 billion , or seven percent , during the six months ended June 30, 2018 . The increase in committed exposure occurred primarily as a result of increases in large conglomerates, as well as trading companies and distributors. Our energy-related committed exposure decreased $1.6 billion , or four percent , during the six months ended June 30, 2018 to $35.2 billion . Energy sector net charge-offs were $27 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $26 million for the same period in 2017. Energy sector reservable criticized exposure decreased $605 million during the six months ended June 30, 2018 to $1.0 billion due to improvement in credit quality of some borrowers coupled with exposure reductions. The energy allowance for credit losses decreased $150 million during the six months ended June 30, 2018 to $410 million.

Bank of America 42 Risk Mitigation We purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. To lower the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, we may add credit exposure within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 , net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, was $2.5 billion and $2.1 billion . We recorded net gains of $7 million and net losses of $10 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to net losses of $16 million and $47 million for the same periods in 2017 on these positions. The gains and losses on these instruments were offset by gains and losses on the related exposures. The Value-at-Risk (VaR) results for these exposures are included in the fair value option portfolio information in Table 44 . For more information, see Trading Risk Management on page 48 .

(4) NR is comprised of index positions held and any names that have not been rated. In addition to our net notional credit default protection purchased to cover the funded and unfunded portion of certain credit exposures, credit derivatives are used for market-making activities for clients and establishing positions intended to profit from directional or relative value changes. We execute the majority of our credit derivative trades in the OTC market with large, multinational financial institutions, including broker-dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety of other investors. Because these transactions are executed in the OTC market, we are subject to settlement risk. We are also subject to credit risk in the event that these counterparties fail to perform under the terms of these contracts. In most cases, credit derivative transactions are executed on a daily margin basis. Therefore, events such as a credit downgrade, depending on the ultimate rating level, or a breach of credit covenants would typically require an increase in the amount of collateral required by the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow us to take additional protective measures such as early termination of all trades. Table 40 presents the total contract/notional amount of credit derivatives outstanding and includes both purchased and written credit derivatives. The credit risk amounts are measured as net asset exposure by counterparty, taking into consideration all contracts with the counterparty. For more information on our written credit derivatives, see Note 3 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . The credit risk amounts discussed above and presented in Table 40 take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements while amounts disclosed in Note 3 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements are shown on a gross basis. Credit risk reflects the potential benefit from offsetting exposure to non-credit derivative products with the same counterparties that may be netted upon the occurrence of certain events, thereby reducing our overall exposure.

We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in government policies. A risk management framework is in place to measure, monitor and manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. In addition to the direct risk of doing business in a country, we also are exposed to indirect country risks (e.g., related to the collateral received on secured financing transactions or related to client clearing activities). These indirect exposures are managed in the normal course of business through credit, market and operational risk governance, rather than through country risk governance. Table 41 presents our 20 largest non-U.S. country exposures at June 30, 2018 . These exposures accounted for 88 percent and 86 percent of our total non-U.S. exposure at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 . Net country exposure for these 20 countries increased $20.7 billion in the six months ended June 30, 2018 , primarily driven by increases in the U.K., Japan and France. Non-U.S. exposure is presented on an internal risk management basis and includes sovereign and non-sovereign credit exposure, securities and other investments issued by or domiciled in countries other than the U.S. Funded loans and loan equivalents include loans, leases, and other extensions of credit and funds, including letters of credit and due from placements. Unfunded commitments are the undrawn portion of legally binding commitments related to loans and loan equivalents. Net counterparty exposure includes the fair value of derivatives, including the counterparty risk associated with credit default swaps, and secured financing transactions. Securities and other investments are carried at fair value and long securities exposures are netted against short exposures with the same underlying issuer to, but not below, zero. Net country exposure represents country exposure less hedges and credit default protection purchased, net of credit default protection sold.

Our largest emerging market country exposure at June 30, 2018 was China, with net exposure of $14.9 billion , concentrated in large state-owned companies, subsidiaries of multinational corporations and commercial banks. The outlook for policy direction and therefore economic performance in the EU remains uncertain as a consequence of reduced political cohesion among EU countries. Additionally, we believe that the uncertainty in the U.K. ability to negotiate a favorable exit from the EU will further weigh on economic performance. Our largest EU country exposure at June 30, 2018 was the U.K. with net exposure of $45.9 billion , an $8.3 billion increase from December 31, 2017 . The increase was driven by corporate loan growth and increased placements with the central bank as part of liquidity management. Markets have reacted negatively to the escalating tensions between the U.S. and several key trading partners. We are closely monitoring our exposures to tariff-sensitive industries and our international exposure, particularly to countries that account for a large percentage of U.S. trade. Bank of America 44 Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses increased $101 million to $827 million , and $100 million to $1.7 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017 . The provision for credit losses was $169 million and $246 million lower than net charge-offs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 , resulting in a decrease in the allowance for credit losses. This compared to a reduction of $182 million and $281 million in the allowance for credit losses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 . The provision for credit losses for the consumer portfolio increased $151 million to $757 million , and $127 million to $1.5 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017 . The increase for both periods was primarily driven by portfolio seasoning and loan growth in the U.S. credit card portfolio, partially offset by the impact of the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business in the second quarter of 2017. Also contributing to the increase in the three-month period was a slowing pace of improvement in the consumer real estate portfolio. Included in the provision is a benefit of $14 million and $25 million related to the PCI loan portfolio for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to a benefit of $24 million and an expense of $44 million for the same periods in 2017 . The provision for credit losses for the commercial portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, decreased $50 million to $70 million , and $27 million to $156 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017 . The decrease for both periods was primarily driven by a reduction in energy exposures. Allowance for Credit Losses Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses The allowance for loan and lease losses is comprised of two components. The first component covers nonperforming commercial loans and TDRs. The second component covers loans and leases on which there are incurred losses that are not yet individually identifiable, as well as incurred losses that may not be represented in the loss forecast models. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses based on the total of these two components. The allowance for loan and lease losses excludes LHFS and loans accounted for under the fair value option as the fair value reflects a credit risk component. For more information on the allowance for loan and lease losses, see Allowance for Credit Losses in the MD&A of the Corporation 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K . During the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 , the factors that impacted the allowance for loan and lease losses included improvements in the credit quality of the consumer real estate portfolios driven by continuing improvements in the U.S. economy and strong labor markets, proactive credit risk management initiatives and the impact of high credit quality originations. Evidencing the improvements in the U.S. economy and strong labor markets are low levels of unemployment and increases in home prices. In addition to these improvements, in the consumer portfolio, nonperforming consumer loans decreased $527 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018 as returns to performing status, paydowns, loan sales and charge-offs continued to outpace new nonaccrual loans. During the six months ended June 30, 2018 , the allowance for loan and lease losses in the commercial portfolio reflected decreased energy reserves primarily driven by reductions in energy exposures including reservable criticized utilized exposures. The allowance for loan and lease losses for the consumer portfolio, as presented in Table 43 , was $5.1 billion at June 30, 2018 , a decrease of $243 million from December 31, 2017 . The decrease was primarily in the consumer real estate portfolio, partially offset by an increase in the U.S. credit card portfolio. The reduction in the allowance for the consumer real estate portfolio was due to improved home prices, lower nonperforming loans and a decrease in loan balances in our non-core portfolio. The increase in the allowance for the U.S. credit card portfolio was driven by portfolio seasoning. The allowance for loan and lease losses for the commercial portfolio, as presented in Table 43 , was $4.9 billion at June 30, 2018 , a decrease of $100 million from December 31, 2017 driven by decreased energy reserves due to reductions in the higher risk energy sub-sectors. Commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure decreased to $12.4 billion at June 30, 2018 from $13.6 billion (to 2.40 percent from 2.65 percent of total commercial reservable utilized exposure) at December 31, 2017 , driven by broad-based improvements including the energy sector. Nonperforming commercial loans remained relatively unchanged at $1.3 billion at both June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 ( 0.26 percent and 0.27 percent of outstanding commercial loans excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option). See Tables 31 , 32 and 33 for more details on key commercial credit statistics. The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding was 1.08 percent at June 30, 2018 compared to 1.12 percent at December 31, 2017 . Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we also estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments such as letters of credit, financial guarantees, unfunded bankers acceptances and binding loan commitments, excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value option. For more information on the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, see Allowance for Credit Losses in the MD&A of the Corporation 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K . The reserve for unfunded lending commitments was $787 million at June 30, 2018 compared to $777 million at December 31, 2017 . 45 Bank of America Table 42 presents a rollforward of the allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 .

Trading Risk Management To evaluate risk arising from trading activities, the Corporation focuses on the actual and potential volatility of revenues generated by individual positions as well as portfolios of positions. VaR is a common statistic used to measure market risk as it allows the aggregation of market risk factors, including the effects of portfolio diversification. A VaR model simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR represents the loss a portfolio is not expected to exceed more than a certain number of times per period, based on a specified holding period, confidence level and window of historical data. We use one VaR model consistently across the trading portfolios and it uses a historical simulation approach based on a three-year window of historical data. Our primary VaR statistic is equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level. This means that for a VaR with a one-day holding period, there should not be losses in excess of VaR, on average, 99 out of 100 trading days. For more information on our trading risk management process, see Trading Risk Management in the MD&A of the Corporation 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Table 44 presents the total market-based trading portfolio VaR which is the combination of the covered positions trading portfolio and the impact from less liquid trading exposures. For more information on the market risk VaR for trading activities, see Trading Risk Management in the MD&A of the Corporation 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K . The total market-based portfolio VaR results in Table 44 include market risk, excluding credit valuation adjustment (CVA), DVA and related hedges, to which we are exposed from all business segments. The majority of this portfolio is within the Global Markets segment. Table 44 presents period-end, average, high and low daily trading VaR for the three months ended June 30, 2018 , March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2017 , as well as average daily trading VaR for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 , using a 99 percent confidence level. The amounts disclosed in Table 44 and Table 45 align to the view of covered positions used in the Basel 3 capital calculations. Foreign exchange and commodity positions are always considered covered positions, regardless of trading or banking treatment for the trade, except for structural foreign currency positions that are excluded with prior regulatory approval. The average total market-based trading portfolio VaR decreased for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the previous quarter primarily due to an increase in portfolio diversification largely driven by changes in the equities risk profile. Table 44 Market Risk VaR for Trading Activities Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30 June 30, 2018 March 31, 2018 June 30, 2017 (Dollars in millions) Period End Average High (1) Low (1) Period End Average High (1) Low (1) Period End Average High (1) Low (1) 2018 Average 2017 Average Foreign exchange $ 8 $ 10 $ 15 $ 7 $ 8 $ 8 $ 12 $ 6 $ 11 $ 13 $ 25 $ 3 $ 9 $ 13 Interest rate 27 23 32 15 33 23 33 18 18 23 33 15 23 20 Credit 30 25 30 20 28 27 31 23 26 25 29 22 26 26 Equity 24 16 26 11 16 19 28 14 19 18 26 13 18 19 Commodities 7 9 14 4 10 6 12 3 6 6 9 4 8 5 Portfolio diversification (65 ) (55 ) (57 ) (49 ) (45 ) (47 ) (53 ) (47 ) Total covered positions portfolio 31 28 38 20 38 34 43 25 35 38 53 26 31 36 Impact from less liquid exposures 2 2 4 6 3 5 4 5 Total covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio 33 30 42 24 42 40 51 29 38 43 60 32 35 41 Fair value option loans 12 13 18 8 12 10 12 8 9 10 12 9 12 11 Fair value option hedges 8 11 17 5 9 8 10 6 6 5 7 4 10 6 Fair value option portfolio diversification (12 ) (13 ) (11 ) (9 ) (6 ) (6 ) (12 ) (7 ) Total fair value option portfolio 8 11 16 5 10 9 10 7 9 9 11 8 10 10 Portfolio diversification (5 ) (7 ) (3 ) (4 ) (5 ) (4 ) (5 ) (5 ) Total market-based portfolio $ 36 $ 34 47 28 $ 49 $ 45 57 33 $ 42 $ 48 66 36 $ 40 $ 46 (1) The high and low for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the high and low for the components. Therefore the impact from less liquid exposures and the amount of portfolio diversification, which is the difference between the total portfolio and the sum of the individual components, is not relevant. Bank of America 48 The graph below presents the daily total market-based trading portfolio VaR for the previous five quarters, corresponding to the data in Table 44 . Additional VaR statistics produced within our single VaR model are provided in Table 45 at the same level of detail as in Table 44 . Evaluating VaR with additional statistics allows for an increased understanding of the risks in the portfolio as the historical market data used in the VaR calculation does not necessarily follow a predefined statistical distribution. Table 45 presents average trading VaR statistics at 99 percent and 95 percent confidence levels for the three months ended June 30, 2018 , March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2017 .

A backtesting excess occurs when a trading loss exceeds the VaR for the corresponding day. These excesses are evaluated to understand the positions and market moves that produced the trading loss and to ensure that the VaR methodology accurately represents those losses. For more information on our backtesting process, see Trading Risk Management Backtesting in the MD&A of the Corporation 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K . During the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 , there were no days in which there was a backtesting excess for our total market-based portfolio VaR, utilizing a one-day holding period. Total Trading-related Revenue Total trading-related revenue, excluding brokerage fees, and CVA, DVA and funding valuation adjustment gains (losses), represents the total amount earned from trading positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. Trading account assets and liabilities are reported at fair value. For more information on fair value, see Note 20 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Trading-related revenue can be volatile and is largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand. Also, trading-related revenue is dependent on the volume and type of transactions, the level of risk assumed, and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the ever-changing market environment. Significant daily revenue by business is monitored and the primary drivers of these are reviewed. The following histogram is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2018 . During the three months ended June 30, 2018 , positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 98 percent of the trading days, of which 91 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million. This compares to the three months ended March 31, 2018 where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 100 percent of the trading days, of which 88 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million. Trading Portfolio Stress Testing Because the very nature of a VaR model suggests results can exceed our estimates and it is dependent on a limited historical window, we also stress test our portfolio using scenario analysis. This analysis estimates the change in the value of our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements. For additional information, see Trading Risk Management Trading Portfolio Stress Testing in the MD&A of the Corporation 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book The following discussion presents net interest income for banking book activities. Interest rate risk represents the most significant market risk exposure to our banking book balance sheet. Interest rate risk is measured as the potential change in net interest income caused by movements in market interest rates. Client-facing activities, primarily lending and deposit-taking, create interest rate sensitive positions on our balance sheet. We prepare forward-looking forecasts of net interest income. The baseline forecast takes into consideration expected future business growth, ALM positioning and the direction of interest rate movements as implied by the market-based forward curve. We then measure and evaluate the impact that alternative interest rate scenarios have on the baseline forecast in order to assess interest rate sensitivity under varied conditions. The net interest income forecast is frequently updated for changing assumptions and differing outlooks based on economic trends, market conditions and business strategies. Thus, we continually monitor our balance sheet position in order to maintain an acceptable level of exposure to interest rate changes. The interest rate scenarios that we analyze incorporate balance sheet assumptions such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, changes in funding mix, product repricing, maturity characteristics and investment securities premium amortization. Our overall goal is to manage interest rate risk so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital. Table 46 presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 . Table 46 Forward Rates June 30, 2018 Federal Funds Three-month LIBOR 10-Year Swap Spot rates 2.00 % 2.34 % 2.93 % 12-month forward rates 2.75 2.84 2.97 December 31, 2017 Spot rates 1.50 % 1.69 % 2.40 % 12-month forward rates 2.00 2.14 2.48 Table 47 shows the pretax impact to forecasted net interest income over the next 12 months from June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 , resulting from instantaneous parallel and non-parallel shocks to the market-based forward curve. Periodically we evaluate the scenarios presented so that they are meaningful in the context of the current rate environment. Bank of America 50 In the six months ended June 30, 2018 , the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet to rising rates has declined modestly primarily due to increases in long-end rates. We continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel move in interest rates with the majority of that impact coming from the short end of the yield curve. Additionally, higher interest rates impact the fair value of debt securities and, accordingly, for debt securities classified as available for sale (AFS), may adversely affect accumulated OCI and thus capital levels under the Basel 3 capital rules. Under instantaneous upward parallel shifts, the near-term adverse impact to Basel 3 capital is reduced over time by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income. For more information on Basel 3, see Capital Management Regulatory Capital on page 22 . Table 47 Estimated Banking Book Net Interest Income Sensitivity Short Rate (bps) Long Rate (bps) June 30 2018 December 31 2017 (Dollars in millions) Curve Change Parallel Shifts +100 bps instantaneous shift +100 +100 $ 2,835 $ 3,317 -100 bps instantaneous shift -100 -100 (3,759 ) (5,183 ) Flatteners Short-end instantaneous change +100 2,004 2,182 Long-end instantaneous change -100 (1,821 ) (2,765 ) Steepeners Short-end instantaneous change -100 (1,914 ) (2,394 ) Long-end instantaneous change +100 843 1,135 The sensitivity analysis in Table 47 assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates. As part of our ALM activities, we use securities, certain residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity. The behavior of our deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income. The sensitivity analysis in Table 47 assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher-yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce our benefit in those scenarios. Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative Contracts Interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts are utilized in our ALM activities and serve as an efficient tool to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk. We use derivatives to hedge the variability in cash flows or changes in fair value on our balance sheet due to interest rate and foreign exchange components. For more information on our hedging activities, see Note 3 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . For more information on interest rate contracts and risk management, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book in the MD&A of the Corporation 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K . We use interest rate derivative instruments to hedge the variability in the cash flows of our assets and liabilities and other forecasted transactions (collectively referred to as cash flow hedges). The net losses on both open and terminated cash flow hedge derivative instruments recorded in accumulated OCI were $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion , on a pretax basis, at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 . These net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the same period as the hedged cash flows affect earnings and will decrease income or increase expense on the respective hedged cash flows. Assuming no change in open cash flow derivative hedge positions and no changes in prices or interest rates beyond what is implied in forward yield curves at June 30, 2018 , the pretax net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings as follows: $383 million , or 23 percent, within the next year, 60 percent in years two through five, and 10 percent in years six through 10, with the remaining seven percent thereafter. For more information on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, see Note 3 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . We hedge our net investment in non-U.S. operations determined to have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar using forward foreign exchange contracts that typically settle in less than 180 days, cross-currency basis swaps and foreign exchange options. We recorded net after-tax losses on derivatives in accumulated OCI associated with net investment hedges which were offset by gains on our net investments in consolidated non-U.S. entities at June 30, 2018 . 51 Bank of America Table 48 presents derivatives utilized in our ALM activities and shows the notional amount, fair value, weighted-average receive-fixed and pay-fixed rates, expected maturity and average estimated durations of our open ALM derivatives at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 . These amounts do not include derivative hedges on our MSRs.

Mortgage Banking Risk Management We originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. We determine whether loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate. Interest rate risk and market risk can be substantial in the mortgage business. Changes in interest rates and other market factors impact the volume of mortgage originations. Changes in interest rates also impact the value of interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and the related residential first mortgage LHFS between the date of the IRLC and the date the loans are sold to the secondary market. An increase in mortgage interest rates typically leads to a decrease in the value of these instruments. Conversely, when there is an increase in interest rates, the value of the MSRs will increase driven by lower prepayment expectations. Because the interest rate risks of these two hedged items offset, we combine them into one overall hedged item with one combined economic hedge portfolio consisting of derivative contracts and securities. Bank of America 52 For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 , we recorded gains of $60 million and $129 million related to the change in fair value of the MSRs, IRLCs and LHFS, net of gains and losses on the hedge portfolio, compared to gains of $41 million and $66 million for the same periods in 2017 . For more information on MSRs, see Note 14 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Complex Accounting Estimates Our significant accounting principles are essential in understanding the MD&A. Many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments. For additional information, see Complex Accounting Estimates in the MD&A of the Corporation 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Goodwill and Intangible Assets The nature of and accounting for goodwill and intangible assets are discussed in the Corporation 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles , Note 8 Goodwill and Intangible Assets and Complex Accounting Estimates of the MD&A. Beginning with our annual goodwill impairment test as of June 30, 2018, we conducted a qualitative assessment, rather than a quantitative assessment as previously performed, that is more fully described in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of June 30, 2018 for all of our reporting units that had goodwill. We performed that test by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its respective carrying value. Factors considered in the qualitative assessments include, among other things, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, financial performance of the respective reporting unit and other relevant entity- and reporting-unit specific considerations. If based on the results of the qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative assessment similar to that performed as of June 30, 2017 is conducted. Based on our qualitative assessments, we determined that for each reporting unit with goodwill, it was more likely than not that its respective fair value exceeded its carrying value, indicating there was no impairment and no need to conduct a quantitative assessment. For more information regarding goodwill balances at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 , see Note 8 Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements .
