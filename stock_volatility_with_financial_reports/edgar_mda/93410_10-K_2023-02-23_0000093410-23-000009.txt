Business Environment and Outlook 
Chevron Corporation is a global energy company with substantial business activities in the following countries: Angola, Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, China, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Israel, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Nigeria, the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, the Philippines, Republic of Congo, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Venezuela. 
The company’s objective is to safely deliver higher returns, lower carbon and superior shareholder value in any business environment. Earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream business segment. The most significant factor affecting the results of operations for the upstream segment is the price of crude oil, which is determined in global markets outside of the company’s control. In the company’s downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products. Periods of sustained lower commodity prices could result in the impairment or write-off of specific assets in future periods and cause the company to adjust operating expenses, including employee reductions, and capital expenditures, along with other measures intended to improve financial performance.
Governments, companies, communities, and other stakeholders are increasingly supporting efforts to address climate change. International initiatives and national, regional and state legislation and regulations that aim to directly or indirectly reduce GHG emissions are in various stages of design, adoption, and implementation. These policies and programs, some of which support the global net zero emissions ambitions of the Paris Agreement, can change the amount of energy consumed, the rate of energy-demand growth, the energy mix, and the relative economics of one fuel versus another. Implementation of jurisdiction-specific policies and programs can be dependent on, and can affect the pace of, technological advancements, the granting of necessary permits by governing authorities, the availability of cost-effective, verifiable carbon credits, the availability of suppliers that can meet sustainability and other standards, evolving regulatory or other requirements affecting ESG standards or other disclosures, and evolving standards for tracking and reporting on emissions and emission reductions and removals. 
Some of these policies and programs include renewable and low carbon fuel standards, such as the Renewable Fuel Standard program in the U.S. and California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard; programs that price GHG emissions, including 
32

California’s Cap-and-Trade Program; performance standards, including methane-specific regulation such as the U.S. EPA’s forthcoming New Source Performance Standard and Emissions Guidelines for Existing Sources; and measures that provide various incentives for lower carbon activities, including carbon capture and storage and the production of hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel, such as the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act. Requirements for these and other similar policies and programs are complex, ever changing, program specific and encompass: (1) the blending of renewable fuels into transportation fuels; (2) the purchasing, selling, utilizing and retiring of allowances and carbon credits; and (3) other emissions reduction measures including efficiency improvements and capturing GHG emissions. While these compliance policies and programs may have negative impacts on the company now and in the future including, but not limited to, the displacement of hydrocarbon and other products, these policies have also enabled opportunities for Chevron as it grows and aims to further grow its lower carbon businesses. For example, the acquisition of Renewable Energy Group, Inc. (REG) in 2022 grew the company’s renewable fuels production capacity and increased the company’s carbon credit generation activities. Although we expect the company’s costs to comply with these policies and programs to continue to increase, these costs currently do not have a material impact on the company’s financial condition or results of operations. 
Significant uncertainty remains as to the pace in which the transition to a lower carbon future will progress, which is dependent, in part, on further advancements and changes in policy, technology, and customer and consumer preferences. The level of expenditure required to comply with new or potential climate change-related laws and regulations and the amount of additional investments needed in new or existing technology or facilities, such as carbon capture and storage, is difficult to predict with certainty and is expected to vary depending on the actual laws and regulations enacted, available technology options, customer and consumer preferences, the company’s activities, and market conditions. As discussed below, in 2021, the company announced planned capital spend of approximately $10 billion through 2028 in lower carbon investments. Although the future is uncertain, many published outlooks conclude that fossil fuels will remain a significant part of an energy system that increasingly incorporates lower carbon sources of supply for many years to come. 
Chevron supports the Paris Agreement’s global approach to governments addressing climate change and continues to take actions to help lower the carbon intensity of its operations while continuing to meet the demand for energy. Chevron believes that broad, market-based mechanisms are the most efficient approach to addressing GHG emission reductions. Chevron integrates climate change-related issues and the regulatory and other responses to these issues into its strategy and planning, capital investment reviews, and risk management tools and processes, where it believes they are applicable. They are also factored into the company’s long-range supply, demand, and energy price forecasts. These forecasts reflect estimates of long-range effects from climate change-related policy actions, such as electric vehicle and renewable fuel penetration, energy efficiency standards, and demand response to oil and natural gas prices. 
The company will continue to develop oil and gas resources to meet customers’ and consumers’ demand for energy. At the same time, Chevron believes that the future of energy is lower carbon. The company will continue to maintain flexibility in its portfolio to be responsive to changes in policy, technology, and customer and consumer preferences. Chevron aims to grow its traditional oil and gas business, lower the carbon intensity of its operations and grow lower carbon businesses in renewable fuels, hydrogen, carbon capture, offsets, and other emerging technologies. To grow its lower carbon businesses, Chevron plans to target sectors of the economy where emissions are harder to abate or that cannot be easily electrified, while leveraging the company’s capabilities, assets and customer relationships. The company’s traditional oil and gas business may increase or decrease depending upon regulatory or market forces, among other factors.
In 2021, Chevron announced the following aspiration and targets that are aligned with its lower carbon strategy:
2050 Net Zero Upstream Aspiration Chevron aspires to achieve net zero for upstream production Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions on an equity basis by 2050. The company believes accomplishing this aspiration depends on, among other things, partnerships with multiple stakeholders including customers, continuing progress on commercially viable technology, government policy, successful negotiations for carbon capture and storage and nature-based projects, availability and acceptability of cost-effective, verifiable offsets in the global market, and granting of necessary permits by governing authorities.
2028 Upstream Production GHG Intensity Targets These metrics include Scope 1, direct emissions, and Scope 2, indirect emissions from imported electricity and steam, and are net of emissions from exported electricity and steam. The targeted 2028 reductions from 2016 on an equity ownership basis include a:
•40 percent reduction in oil production GHG intensity to 24 kilograms (kg) carbon dioxide equivalent per barrel of oil-equivalent (CO2e/boe), 
•26 percent reduction in gas production GHG intensity to 24 kg CO2e/boe, 
33


 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations	
Financial Table of Contents
 
•53 percent reduction in methane intensity to 2 kg CO2e/boe, and 
•66 percent reduction in flaring GHG intensity to 3 kg CO2e/boe. 
The company also targets no routine flaring by 2030. We have set 2016 as our baseline to align with the year the Paris Agreement entered into force, and the company plans to update the metrics every five years in line with the Paris Agreement stocktakes. We believe these updates will provide additional transparency on the company’s progress toward its net zero aspiration. 
2028 Portfolio Carbon Intensity Target The company also introduced a portfolio carbon intensity (PCI) metric, which is a measure of the carbon intensity across the full value chain of Chevron’s entire business. This metric encompasses the company’s upstream and downstream business and includes Scope 1 (direct emissions), Scope 2 (indirect emissions from imported electricity and steam), and certain Scope 3 (primarily emissions from use of sold products) emissions. The company’s PCI target is 71 grams (g) carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) per megajoule (MJ) by 2028, a greater than five percent reduction from 2016. 
Planned Lower-Carbon Capital Spend through 2028 In 2021, the company established planned capital spend of approximately $10 billion through 2028 to advance its lower carbon strategy, which includes approximately $2 billion to lower the carbon intensity of its traditional oil and gas operations, and approximately $8 billion for lower carbon investments in renewable fuels, hydrogen and carbon capture and offsets. We anticipate setting additional capital spending targets as the company progresses toward its 2050 upstream production Scope 1 and 2 net zero aspiration and further grows its lower carbon business lines. 
During 2021 and 2022, the company spent $4.8 billion in lower carbon investments, including $2.9 billion associated with the acquisition of REG.
Refer to “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A, on pages 20 through 26 for further discussion of GHG regulation and climate change and the associated risks to Chevron’s business, including the risks impacting Chevron’s lower carbon strategy and its aspirations, targets and plans.
Income Taxes The effective tax rate for the company can change substantially during periods of significant earnings volatility. This is due to the mix effects that are impacted by both the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arise in higher or lower tax rate jurisdictions. As a result, a decline or increase in the effective income tax rate in one period may not be indicative of expected results in future periods. Additional information related to the company’s effective income tax rate is included in Note 17 Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), enacted in the United States on August 16, 2022, imposes several new taxes that will be effective in 2023, including a 15 percent minimum tax on book income and a 1 percent excise tax on stock repurchases. The IRA also implements various incentives for lower carbon activities, including carbon capture and storage and the production of hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel, and extends the federal biodiesel mixture excise tax credit through December 31, 2024. We do not currently expect the IRA to have a material impact on our results of operations.
Supply Chain and Inflation Impacts The company is actively managing its contracting, procurement, and supply chain activities to effectively manage costs and facilitate supply chain resiliency and continuity in support of the company’s operational goals. Third party costs for capital, exploration, and operating expenses can be subject to external factors beyond the company’s control including, but not limited to: severe weather or civil unrest, delays in construction, global and local supply chain distribution issues, inflation, tariffs or other taxes imposed on goods or services, and market-based prices charged by the industry’s material and service providers. Chevron utilizes contracts with various pricing mechanisms, which may result in a lag before the company’s costs reflect changes in market trends.
Inflation continued to be a key factor impacting the economy over the last year. For key oil and gas industry inputs (e.g. rigs, well services, etc.), markets are likely to remain tight with any upward pressure tied directly to possible increases in activity. In contrast, inflationary pressures have started to reduce for non-oil and gas specific goods and services as a result of reduced supply chain disruptions and a slowdown in economic activity. Chevron’s 2023 capital expenditure budget assumes cost inflation that averages in the mid-single digits with certain areas higher, such as in the Permian Basin that assumes low double-digit cost inflation. Chevron believes it is well positioned to manage its costs for 2023, in large part due to indexed contracts and secured supplies for critical inputs.

Refer to the “Cautionary Statements Relevant to Forward-Looking Information” on page 2 and to “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A, on pages 20 through 26 for a discussion of some of the inherent risks that could materially impact the company’s results of operations or financial condition. 
Other Impacts  The company continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not expected to provide sufficient long-term value and to acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset base to help augment the company’s financial performance and value growth. Asset dispositions and restructurings may result in significant gains or losses in future periods. 
The company closely monitors developments in the financial and credit markets, the level of worldwide economic activity, and the implications for the company of movements in prices for crude oil and natural gas. Management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planning.
The COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant decrease in demand for our products and created disruptions and volatility in the global marketplace beginning late in first quarter 2020. Demand has largely recovered as of year-end 2022; however, there continues to be uncertainty around the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our future results, which could be material.
Earnings trends for the company’s major business areas are described as follows:
Upstream Earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry prices for crude oil and natural gas. Crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over which the company has no control, including product demand connected with global economic conditions, industry production and inventory levels, technology advancements, production quotas or other actions imposed by OPEC+ countries, actions of regulators, weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, natural and human causes beyond the company’s control such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest or political uncertainty. Any of these factors could also inhibit the company’s production capacity in an affected region. The company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses. 
The longer-term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors, including the company’s ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas, changes in fiscal terms of contracts, the pace of energy transition, and changes in tax, environmental and other applicable laws and regulations.
Chevron has interests in Venezuelan assets operated by independent affiliates. Chevron has been conducting limited activities in Venezuela consistent with the authorization provided pursuant to general licenses issued by the United States government. In fourth quarter 2022, Chevron received License 41 from the United States government, enabling the company to resume activity in Venezuela subject to certain limitations. The financial results for Chevron’s business in Venezuela are being recorded as non-equity investments since 2020, where income is only recognized when cash is received and production and reserves are not included in the company's results. Crude oil liftings in Venezuela commenced in first quarter 2023, which are expected to positively impact the company’s results going forward.
Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), an equity affiliate, operates a 935-mile crude oil export pipeline from the Tengiz Field in Kazakhstan to tanker-loading facilities at Novorossiysk on the Russian coast of the Black Sea, providing the main export route for crude oil production from TCO, Karachaganak and other producing fields in Kazakhstan. The tanker loading facilities at Novorossiysk consist of three single point mooring facilities, with availability of two or more required to operate at full capacity. CPC is capable of operating at approximately 70 percent of capacity with one single point mooring facility in service. Two of the three offshore loading moorings at the CPC marine terminal were taken out of service during August 2022 for equipment repairs identified during normal maintenance. Repairs were completed in fourth quarter 2022. Production at TCO was not impacted by this CPC outage given turnaround activity at TCO and at other regional producers that ship through CPC. However, there is a risk that production from TCO could be curtailed in the future should availability of export facilities be constrained.
Governments (including Russia) have imposed and may impose additional sanctions and other trade laws, restrictions and regulations that could lead to disruption in our ability to produce, transport and/or export crude in the region around Russia and could have an adverse effect on CPC operations and/or the company’s financial position. The financial impacts of such risks, including presently imposed sanctions, are not currently material for the company; however, it remains uncertain how long these conditions may last or how severe they may become.

Commodity Prices The following chart shows the trend in benchmark prices for Brent crude oil, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil and U.S. Henry Hub natural gas. The Brent price averaged $101 per barrel for the full-year 2022, compared to $71 in 2021. As of mid-February 2023, the Brent price was $85 per barrel. The WTI price averaged $95 per barrel for the full-year 2022, compared to $68 in 2021. As of mid-February 2023, the WTI price was $79 per barrel. The majority of the company’s equity crude production is priced based on the Brent benchmark.
cvx-20221231_g1.jpg
Crude prices increased in 2022 driven by geopolitical risk, supply decisions by OPEC+ and continued demand recovery due to the further easing of COVID-19 restrictions. The company’s average realization for U.S. crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2022 was $77 per barrel, up 37 percent from 2021. The company’s average realization for international crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2022 was $91 per barrel, up 41 percent from 2021.
In contrast to price movements in the global market for crude oil, prices for natural gas are also impacted by regional supply and demand and infrastructure conditions in local markets. In the United States, prices at Henry Hub averaged $6.36 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) during 2022, compared with $3.85 per MCF during 2021. As of mid-February 2023, the Henry Hub spot price was $2.40 per MCF. (See page 43 for the company’s average natural gas realizations for the U.S.).
Outside the United States, prices for natural gas also depend on a wide range of supply, demand and regulatory circumstances. The company’s long-term contract prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) are typically linked to crude oil prices. Most of the equity LNG offtake from the operated Australian LNG projects is committed under binding long-term contracts, with some sold in the Asian spot LNG market. International natural gas realizations averaged $9.75 per MCF during 2022, compared with $5.93 per MCF during 2021, mainly due to higher LNG prices. 
Production The company’s worldwide net oil-equivalent production in 2022 was 3 million barrels per day. About 27 percent of the company’s net oil-equivalent production in 2022 occurred in OPEC+ member countries of Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and Republic of Congo.
The company estimates its net oil-equivalent production in 2023, assuming a Brent crude oil price of $80 per barrel, to be flat to up 3 percent compared to 2022. This estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties, including quotas or other actions that may be imposed by OPEC+; price effects on entitlement volumes; changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations; delays in construction; reservoir performance; greater-than-expected declines in production from mature fields; start-up or ramp-up of projects; fluctuations in demand for crude oil and natural gas in various markets; weather conditions that may shut in production; civil unrest; changing geopolitics; delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds; storage constraints or economic conditions that could lead to shut-in production; or other disruptions to operations. The outlook for future production levels is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production. The company has increased its investment emphasis on short-cycle projects.

Proved Reserves Net proved reserves for consolidated companies and affiliated companies totaled 11.2 billion barrels of oil-equivalent at year-end 2022, a slight decrease from year-end 2021. The reserve replacement ratio in 2022 was 97 percent. The 5 and 10 year reserve replacement ratios were 92 percent and 99 percent, respectively. Refer to Table V for a tabulation of the company’s proved net oil and gas reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of 2020 and each year-end from 2020 through 2022, and an accompanying discussion of major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the three-year period ending December 31, 2022.
Refer to the “Results of Operations” section on pages 39 and 40 for additional discussion of the company’s upstream business.
Downstream Earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining, manufacturing and marketing of products that include gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, lubricants, fuel oil, fuel and lubricant additives, petrochemicals and renewable fuels. Industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and regional supply-and-demand balance for refined products and petrochemicals, and by changes in the price of crude oil, other refinery and petrochemical feedstocks, and natural gas. Industry margins can also be influenced by inventory levels, geopolitical events, costs of materials and services, refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization, maintenance programs, and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather, fires or other operational events.
Other factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the company’s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, the effectiveness of its crude oil and product supply functions, and the volatility of tanker-charter rates for the company’s shipping operations, which are driven by the industry’s demand for crude oil and product tankers. Other factors beyond the company’s control include the general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the company’s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, and changes in tax, environmental, and other applicable laws and regulations.
Refining margins were higher in 2022 because of recovering demand for refined products, low product inventories, lower industry refining capacity and lower product exports from Russia and China. Refining utilization was strong in 2022 to keep pace with demand growth. Although refining margins were elevated and still remain above historical levels, they fell considerably in late 2022. There are signs that higher refined product prices and concerns over macroeconomic conditions are slowing demand.
The company’s most significant marketing areas are the West Coast and Gulf Coast of the United States and Asia Pacific. Chevron operates or has significant ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas. Additionally, the company has a growing presence in renewable fuels after acquiring REG. 
Refer to the “Results of Operations” section on page 40 for additional discussion of the company’s downstream operations.
All Other consists of worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies.

Millions of dollars	2022			2021		2020
Earnings (Loss)	$	12,621 				$	7,319 			$	(1,608)	
 
U.S. upstream reported earnings of $12.6 billion in 2022, compared with $7.3 billion in 2021. The increase was due to higher realizations of $6.6 billion and higher sales volumes of $380 million, partially offset by higher operating expenses of $1.1 billion largely due to an early contract termination at Sabine Pass and lower asset sale gains of $670 million.
The company’s average realization for U.S. crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2022 was $76.71 per barrel compared with $56.06 in 2021. The average natural gas realization was $5.55 per thousand cubic feet in 2022, compared with $3.11 in 2021.
Net oil-equivalent production in 2022 averaged 1.18 million barrels per day, up 4 percent from 2021. The increase was primarily due to net production increases in the Permian Basin.
The net liquids component of oil-equivalent production for 2022 averaged 888,000 barrels per day, up 3 percent from 2021. Net natural gas production averaged 1.76 billion cubic feet per day in 2022, an increase of 4 percent from 2021.

International upstream reported earnings of $17.7 billion in 2022, compared with $8.5 billion in 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher realizations of $10.0 billion, lower operating expenses, lower depreciation, depletion and amortization related to end of concessions in Indonesia and Thailand of $1.3 billion and asset sale gains of $220 million.  This was partially offset by lower sales volumes of $1.3 billion (also largely associated with the end of concessions in Indonesia and Thailand) and write-off and impairment charges of $1.1 billion. Foreign currency effects had a favorable impact on earnings of $514 million between periods. 
The company’s average realization for international crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2022 was $90.71 per barrel compared with $64.53 in 2021. The average natural gas realization was $9.75 per thousand cubic feet in 2022 compared with $5.93 in 2021.
International net oil-equivalent production was 1.82 million barrels per day in 2022, down 7 percent from 2021. The decrease was primarily due to lower production following expiration of the Erawan concession in Thailand and Rokan concession in Indonesia. 
The net liquids component of international oil-equivalent production was 831,000 barrels per day in 2022,  a decrease of 13 percent from 2021. International net natural gas production of 5.92 billion cubic feet per day in 2022,  a decrease of 2 percent from 2021.

U.S. downstream reported earnings of $5.4 billion in 2022, compared with $2.4 billion in 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher margins on refined product sales of $4.4 billion, partially offset by lower earnings from the 50 percent-owned CPChem of $790 million and higher operating expenses of $790 million, largely due to planned turnarounds.
Total refined product sales of 1.23 million barrels per day in 2022 increased 8 percent from 2021, mainly due to higher renewable fuel sales following the REG acquisition and higher jet fuel demand.

The increase in income tax expense in 2022 of $8.1 billion is due to the increase in total income before tax for the company of $28.0 billion. The increase in income before taxes for the company is primarily the result of higher upstream realizations and downstream margins. 
U.S. income before tax increased from $9.7 billion in 2021 to $21.0 billion in 2022. This $11.3 billion increase in income was primarily driven by higher upstream realizations and downstream margins, partially offset by higher operating expenses and lower asset sale gains. The increase in income had a direct impact on the company’s U.S. income tax resulting in an increase to tax expense of $2.9 billion between year-over-year periods, from $1.6 billion in 2021 to $4.5 billion in 2022.
International income before tax increased from $12.0 billion in 2021 to $28.7 billion in 2022. This $16.7 billion increase in income was primarily driven by higher upstream realizations and downstream margins. The increased income primarily drove the $5.2 billion increase in international income tax expense between year-over-year periods, from $4.3 billion in 2021 to $9.6 billion in 2022.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
Sources and Uses of Cash The strength of the company’s balance sheet enables it to fund any timing differences throughout the year between cash inflows and outflows. 
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Total balances were $17.9 billion and $5.7 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Cash provided by operating activities in 2022 was $49.6 billion, compared to $29.2 billion in 2021, primarily due to higher upstream realizations and refining margins. Cash provided by operating activities was net of contributions to employee pension plans of approximately $1.3 billion in 2022 and $1.8 billion in 2021. Proceeds and deposits related to asset sales totaled $1.4 billion in each of the last two years. Returns of investment totaled $1.2 billion and $439 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The returns of investment in 2022 were primarily from Angola LNG. As of third quarter 2022, Angola LNG distributions were, and are expected to continue to be, largely reflected in cash flow from operations. Cash flow from financing activities includes proceeds from shares issued for stock options of $5.8 billion in 2022, compared with $1.4 billion in 2021. Future cash proceeds from option exercises are expected to be lower than in 2022.  
Restricted cash of $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, was held in cash and short-term marketable securities and recorded as “Deferred charges and other assets” and “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These amounts are generally associated with upstream decommissioning activities, tax payments and funds held in escrow for tax-deferred exchanges. 
Dividends Dividends paid to common stockholders were $11.0 billion in 2022 and $10.2 billion in 2021. 
Debt and Finance Lease Liabilities Total debt and finance lease liabilities were $23.3 billion at December 31, 2022, down from $31.4 billion at year-end 2021. 
The $8.1 billion decrease in total debt and finance lease liabilities during 2022 was primarily due to the repayment of long-term notes that matured during the year and the early retirement of long-term notes. The company’s debt and finance lease liabilities due within one year, consisting primarily of the current portion of long-term debt and redeemable long-term obligations, totaled $6.0 billion at December 31, 2022, compared with $8.0 billion at year-end 2021. Of these amounts, $4.1 billion and $7.8 billion were reclassified to long-term debt at the end of 2022 and 2021, respectively.
At year-end 2022, settlement of these obligations was not expected to require the use of working capital in 2023, as the company had the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis. 
The company has access to a commercial paper program as a financing source for working capital or other short-term needs. The company had no commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2022. 
The company has an automatic shelf registration statement that expires in August 2023 for an unspecified amount of nonconvertible debt securities issued by Chevron Corporation or Chevron U.S.A. Inc. (CUSA).

The major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate the company’s debt, and the company’s cost of borrowing can increase or decrease depending on these debt ratings. The company has outstanding public bonds issued by Chevron Corporation, CUSA, Noble Energy, Inc. (Noble), and Texaco Capital Inc. Most of these securities are the obligations of, or guaranteed by, Chevron Corporation and are rated AA- by Standard and Poor’s Corporation and Aa2 by Moody’s Investors Service. The company’s U.S. commercial paper is rated A-1+ by Standard and Poor’s and P-1 by Moody’s. All of these ratings denote high-quality, investment-grade securities. 
The company’s future debt level is dependent primarily on results of operations, cash that may be generated from asset dispositions, the capital program, lending commitments to affiliates and shareholder distributions. Based on its high-quality debt ratings, the company believes that it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash requirements. During extended periods of low prices for crude oil and natural gas and narrow margins for refined products and commodity chemicals, the company has the ability to modify its capital spending plans and discontinue or curtail the stock repurchase program. This provides the flexibility to continue paying the common stock dividend and remain committed to retaining the company’s high-quality debt ratings.
Committed Credit Facilities Information related to committed credit facilities is included in Note 19 Short-Term Debt.
Summarized Financial Information for Guarantee of Securities of Subsidiaries CUSA issued bonds that are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured basis by Chevron Corporation (together, the “Obligor Group”). The tables below contain summary financial information for Chevron Corporation, as Guarantor, excluding its consolidated subsidiaries, and CUSA, as the issuer, excluding its consolidated subsidiaries. The summary financial information of the Obligor Group is presented on a combined basis, and transactions between the combined entities have been eliminated. Financial information for non-guarantor entities has been excluded.

Common Stock Repurchase Program The Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program in 2019, with a maximum dollar limit of $25 billion and no set term limits (the “2019 Program”). During 2022, the company purchased 69.9 million shares for $11.25 billion under the 2019 Program. As of December 31, 2022, the company had purchased a total of 131.4 million shares for $18.1 billion, resulting in $6.9 billion remaining under the 2019 Program. The company currently expects to repurchase $3.75 billion of its common stock during the first quarter of 2023 under the 2019 Program and will incur an additional one percent excise tax on such purchases as required by the IRA.
On January 25, 2023, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of the company’s shares of common stock in an aggregate amount of $75 billion. The $75 billion authorization takes effect on April 1, 2023 and does not have a fixed expiration date (the “2023 Program”). It replaces the Board’s previous repurchase authorization of $25 billion from January 2019, which will terminate on March 31, 2023, after the completion of the company’s repurchases in the first quarter of 2023. 
Repurchases of shares of the company’s common stock may be made from time to time in the open market, by block purchases, in privately negotiated transactions or in such other manner as determined by the company. The timing of the

repurchases and the actual amount repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of the company’s shares, general market and economic conditions, and other factors. The stock repurchase program does not obligate the company to acquire any particular amount of common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.
Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures (Capex) primarily includes additions to fixed asset or investment accounts for the company’s consolidated subsidiaries and is disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Capex by business segment for 2022, 2021 and 2020 is as follows:
Year ended December 31

Capex for 2022 was $12.0 billion, 49 percent higher than 2021 due to increased upstream spend in the Permian Basin along with higher spend in downstream, largely related to the formation of the Bunge North America, Inc. (Bunge) joint venture and acquisition of the remaining interest in Beyond6, LLC (Beyond6).
The company estimates that 2023 Capex will be approximately $14 billion. In the upstream business, Capex is estimated to be $11.5 billion and includes more than $4 billion for Permian Basin development and roughly $2 billion for other shale & tight assets. More than 20 percent of upstream Capex is planned for projects in the Gulf of Mexico. Worldwide downstream spending in 2023 is estimated to be $1.9 billion. Investments in technology businesses and other corporate operations in 2023 are budgeted at $0.6 billion. Lower carbon Capex across all segments totals around $2 billion, including approximately $0.5 billion to lower the carbon intensity of Chevron’s traditional operations and about $1 billion to increase renewable fuels production capacity. 
Affiliate capital expenditures (Affiliate Capex), which does not require cash outlays by the company, is expected to be $3 billion in 2023.  Nearly half of Affiliate Capex is for Tengizchevroil’s FGP / WPMP Project in Kazakhstan and about a third is for CPChem.  
Capital and Exploratory Expenditures Capital and exploratory expenditures (C&E) is a key performance indicator and provides the company’s investment level in its consolidated companies. This metric includes additions to fixed asset or investment accounts along with exploration expense for its consolidated companies. Management uses this metric along with Affiliate C&E (as defined below) to manage the allocation of capital across the company’s entire portfolio, funding requirements and ultimately shareholder distributions.
The components of C&E are presented in the following table:

C&E for 2022 was $12.3 billion, 44 percent higher than 2021 due to increased upstream spend in the Permian Basin along with higher spend in downstream, largely related to the formation of the Bunge joint venture and acquisition of the remaining interest in Beyond6. The acquisitions of Renewable Energy Group Inc. and Noble are not included in the company’s C&E or Capex.
Affiliate Capital and Exploratory Expenditures Equity affiliate capital and exploratory expenditures (Affiliate C&E) is also a key performance indicator that provides the company’s share of investments in its significant equity affiliate companies. This metric includes additions to fixed asset and investment accounts along with exploration expense in the equity affiliate companies’ financial statements. Management uses this metric to assess possible funding needs and/or shareholder distribution capacity of the company’s equity affiliate companies. Together with C&E, management also uses Affiliate C&E to manage allocation of capital across the company’s entire portfolio, funding requirements and ultimately shareholder distributions. 
Affiliate C&E, which is the same as Affiliate Capex spend, by business segment for 2022, 2021 and 2020 is as follows:

Financial Ratios and Metrics
The following represent several metrics the company believes are useful measures to monitor the financial health of the company and its performance over time:
Current Ratio Current assets divided by current liabilities, which indicates the company’s ability to repay its short-term liabilities with short-term assets. The current ratio in all periods was adversely affected by the fact that Chevron’s inventories are valued on a last-in, first-out basis. At year-end 2022, the book value of inventory was lower than replacement costs, based on average acquisition costs during the year, by approximately $9.1 billion.

Current liabilities	34,208 					26,791 				22,183 		
Current Ratio	1.5				1.3			1.2	
 
Interest Coverage Ratio Income before income tax expense, plus interest and debt expense and amortization of capitalized interest, less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, divided by before-tax interest costs. This ratio indicates the company’s ability to pay interest on outstanding debt. The company’s interest coverage ratio in 2022 was higher than 2021 due to higher income.

Financial and Derivative Instrument Market Risk 
The market risk associated with the company’s portfolio of financial and derivative instruments is discussed below. The estimates of financial exposure to market risk do not represent the company’s projection of future market changes. The actual impact of future market changes could differ materially due to factors discussed elsewhere in this report, including those set forth under the heading “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A.

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations	
Financial Table of Contents
 
Derivative Commodity Instruments Chevron is exposed to market risks related to the price volatility of crude oil, refined products, natural gas liquids, natural gas, liquefied natural gas and refinery feedstocks. The company uses derivative commodity instruments to manage these exposures on a portion of its activity, including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the purchase, sale and storage of crude oil, refined products, natural gas liquids, natural gas, liquefied natural gas and feedstock for company refineries. The company also uses derivative commodity instruments for limited trading purposes. The results of these activities were not material to the company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows in 2022. 
The company’s market exposure positions are monitored on a daily basis by an internal Risk Control group in accordance with the company’s risk management policies. The company’s risk management practices and its compliance with policies are reviewed by the Audit Committee of the company’s Board of Directors. 
Derivatives beyond those designated as normal purchase and normal sale contracts are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. Fair values are derived principally from published market quotes and other independent third-party quotes. The change in fair value of Chevron’s derivative commodity instruments in 2022 was not material to the company’s results of operations. 
The company uses the Monte Carlo simulation method as its Value-at-Risk (VaR) model to estimate the maximum potential loss in fair value, at the 95 percent confidence level with a one-day holding period, from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on derivative commodity instruments held or issued. Based on these inputs, the VaR for the company’s primary risk exposures in the area of derivative commodity instruments at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was not material to the company’s cash flows or results of operations. 
Foreign Currency The company may enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to manage some of its foreign currency exposures. These exposures include revenue and anticipated purchase transactions, including foreign currency capital expenditures and lease commitments. The foreign currency derivative contracts, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. There were no material open foreign currency derivative contracts at December 31, 2022.
Interest Rates The company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. Interest rate swaps, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. At year-end 2022, the company had no interest rate swaps. 
Transactions With Related Parties 
Chevron enters into a number of business arrangements with related parties, principally its equity affiliates. These arrangements include long-term supply or offtake agreements and long-term purchase agreements. Refer to “Other Information” in Note 15 Investments and Advances for further discussion. Management believes these agreements have been negotiated on terms consistent with those that would have been negotiated with an unrelated party.

environmental issues. The liability balance of approximately $12.7 billion for asset retirement obligations at year-end 2022 is related primarily to upstream properties. 
For the company’s other ongoing operating assets, such as refineries and chemicals facilities, no provisions are made for exit or cleanup costs that may be required when such assets reach the end of their useful lives unless a decision to sell or otherwise decommission the facility has been made, as the indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of the asset retirement obligation. 
Refer to the discussion below for additional information on environmental matters and their impact on Chevron, and on the company’s 2022 environmental expenditures. Refer to Note 24 Other Contingencies and Commitments under the heading “Environmental” for additional discussion of environmental remediation provisions and year-end reserves. Refer also to Note 25 Asset Retirement Obligations for additional discussion of the company’s asset retirement obligations.
Suspended Wells Information related to suspended wells is included in Note 21 Accounting for Suspended Exploratory Wells.
Income Taxes Information related to income tax contingencies is included in Note 17 Taxes and in Note 24 Other Contingencies and Commitments under the heading “Income Taxes.”
Other Contingencies Information related to other contingencies is included in Note 24 Other Contingencies and Commitments under the heading “Other Contingencies.” 
Environmental Matters 
The company is subject to various international and U.S. federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and market-based programs. These laws, regulations and programs continue to evolve and are expected to increase in both number and complexity over time and govern not only the manner in which the company conducts its operations, but also the products it sells. Consideration of environmental issues and the responses to those issues through international agreements and national, regional or state legislation or regulations are integrated into the company’s strategy and planning, capital investment reviews and risk management tools and processes, where applicable. They are also factored into the company’s long-range supply, demand and energy price forecasts. These forecasts reflect long-range effects from renewable fuel penetration, energy efficiency standards, climate-related policy actions, and demand response to oil and natural gas prices. In addition, legislation and regulations intended to address hydraulic fracturing also continue to evolve in many jurisdictions where we operate. Refer to “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A, on pages 20 through 26 for a discussion of some of the inherent risks of increasingly restrictive environmental and other regulation that could materially impact the company’s results of operations or financial condition. Refer to Business Environment and Outlook on pages 32 and 33 for a discussion of legislative and regulatory efforts to address climate change.  
Most of the costs of complying with existing laws and regulations pertaining to company operations and products are embedded in the normal costs of doing business. However, it is not possible to predict with certainty the amount of additional investments in new or existing technology or facilities or the amounts of increased operating costs to be incurred in the future to prevent, control, reduce or eliminate releases of hazardous materials or other pollutants into the environment; remediate and restore areas damaged by prior releases of hazardous materials; or comply with new environmental laws or regulations. Although these costs may be significant to the results of operations in any single period, the company does not presently expect them to have a material adverse effect on the company’s liquidity or financial position.
Accidental leaks and spills requiring cleanup may occur in the ordinary course of business. The company may incur expenses for corrective actions at various owned and previously owned facilities and at third-party-owned waste disposal sites used by the company. An obligation may arise when operations are closed or sold or at non-Chevron sites where company products have been handled or disposed of. Most of the expenditures to fulfill these obligations relate to facilities and sites where past operations followed practices and procedures that were considered acceptable at the time but now require investigative or remedial work or both to meet current standards. 
Using definitions and guidelines established by the American Petroleum Institute, Chevron estimated its worldwide environmental spending in 2022 at approximately $2.0 billion for its consolidated companies. Included in these expenditures were approximately $0.2 billion of environmental capital expenditures and $1.8 billion of costs associated with the prevention, control, abatement or elimination of hazardous substances and pollutants from operating, closed or divested sites, and the decommissioning and restoration of sites.

For 2023, total worldwide environmental capital expenditures are estimated at $0.2 billion. These capital costs are in addition to the ongoing costs of complying with environmental regulations and the costs to remediate previously contaminated sites.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions 
Management makes many estimates and assumptions in the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) that may have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and on the comparability of such information over different reporting periods. Such estimates and assumptions affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates and assumptions are based on management’s experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. 
The discussion in this section of “critical” accounting estimates and assumptions is according to the disclosure guidelines of the SEC, wherein: 
1.the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters, or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and
2.the impact of the estimates and assumptions on the company’s financial condition or operating performance is material.
The development and selection of accounting estimates and assumptions, including those deemed “critical,” and the associated disclosures in this discussion have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The areas of accounting and the associated “critical” estimates and assumptions made by the company are as follows: 
Oil and Gas Reserves Crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves are estimates of future production that impact certain asset and expense accounts included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Proved reserves include both developed and undeveloped volumes. Proved developed reserves represent volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves are volumes expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled proved acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Variables impacting Chevron’s estimated volumes of crude oil and natural gas reserves include field performance, available technology, commodity prices, and development, production and carbon costs. 
The estimates of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves are important to the timing of expense recognition for costs incurred and to the valuation of certain oil and gas producing assets. Impacts of oil and gas reserves on Chevron’s Consolidated Financial Statements, using the successful efforts method of accounting, include the following:
1.Amortization - Capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs are depreciated on a unit-of-production (UOP) basis using proved developed reserves. Acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized on a UOP basis using total proved reserves. During 2022, Chevron’s UOP Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) for oil and gas properties was $10.8 billion, and proved developed reserves at the beginning of 2022 were 6.6 billion barrels for consolidated companies. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the UOP calculations for consolidated operations had been lower by five percent across all oil and gas properties, UOP DD&A in 2022 would have increased by approximately $600 million. 
2.Impairment - Oil and gas reserves are used in assessing oil and gas producing properties for impairment. A significant reduction in the estimated reserves of a property would trigger an impairment review. Proved reserves (and, in some cases, a portion of unproved resources) are used to estimate future production volumes in the cash flow model. For a further discussion of estimates and assumptions used in impairment assessments, see Impairment of Properties, Plant and Equipment and Investments in Affiliates below.
Refer to Table V, “Reserve Quantity Information,” for the changes in proved reserve estimates for each of the three years ended December 31,  2020, 2021 and 2022, and to Table VII, “Changes in the Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows From Proved Reserves” for estimates of proved reserve values for each of the three years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022.

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations	
Financial Table of Contents
 
This Oil and Gas Reserves commentary should be read in conjunction with the Properties, Plant and Equipment section of Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, which includes a description of the “successful efforts” method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and production activities.
Impairment of Properties, Plant and Equipment and Investments in Affiliates The company assesses its properties, plant and equipment (PP&E) for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected from the asset, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value. 
Determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters, such as future commodity prices, operating expenses, carbon costs, production profiles, the pace of the energy transition, and the outlook for global or regional market supply-and-demand conditions for crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas, commodity chemicals and refined products. However, the impairment reviews and calculations are based on assumptions that are generally consistent with the company’s business plans and long-term investment decisions. Refer also to the discussion of impairments of properties, plant and equipment in Note 18 Properties, Plant and Equipment and to the section on Properties, Plant and Equipment in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
The company performs impairment assessments when triggering events arise to determine whether any write-down in the carrying value of an asset or asset group is required. For example, when significant downward revisions to crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves are made for any single field or concession, an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset remains recoverable. Similarly, a significant downward revision in the company’s crude oil, natural gas liquids or natural gas price outlook would trigger impairment reviews for impacted upstream assets. In addition, impairments could occur due to changes in national, state or local environmental regulations or laws, including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas. Also, if the expectation of sale of a particular asset or asset group in any period has been deemed more likely than not, an impairment review is performed, and if the estimated net proceeds exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group, no impairment charge is required. Such calculations are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is disposed. Assets that are not impaired on a held-and-used basis could possibly become impaired if a decision is made to sell such assets. That is, the assets would be impaired if they are classified as held-for-sale and the estimated proceeds from the sale, less costs to sell, are less than the assets’ associated carrying values.
Investments in common stock of affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method, as well as investments in other securities of these equity investees, are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment falls below the company’s carrying value. When this occurs, a determination must be made as to whether this loss is other-than-temporary, in which case the investment is impaired. Because of the number of differing assumptions potentially affecting whether an investment is impaired in any period or the amount of the impairment, a sensitivity analysis is not practicable. 
A sensitivity analysis of the impact on earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in impairment reviews and impairment calculations is not practicable, given the broad range of the company’s PP&E and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates. That is, favorable changes to some assumptions might have avoided the need to impair any assets in these periods, whereas unfavorable changes might have caused an additional unknown number of other assets to become impaired, or resulted in larger impacts on impaired assets.
Asset Retirement Obligations In the determination of fair value for an asset retirement obligation (ARO), the company uses various assumptions and judgments, including such factors as the existence of a legal obligation, estimated amounts and timing of settlements, discount and inflation rates, and the expected impact of advances in technology and process improvements. A sensitivity analysis of the ARO impact on earnings for 2022 is not practicable, given the broad range of the company’s long-lived assets and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates. That is, favorable changes to some assumptions would have reduced estimated future obligations, thereby lowering accretion expense and amortization costs, whereas unfavorable changes would have the opposite effect. Refer to Note 25 Asset Retirement Obligations for additional discussions on asset retirement obligations.
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans Note 23 Employee Benefit Plans includes information on the funded status of the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet; the components of pension and OPEB expense reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Income; and the related underlying assumptions.
53


 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations	
Financial Table of Contents
 
The determination of pension plan expense and obligations is based on a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate applied to pension plan obligations. Critical assumptions in determining expense and obligations for OPEB plans, which provide for certain health care and life insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees and which are not funded, are the discount rate and the assumed health care cost-trend rates. Information related to the company’s processes to develop these assumptions is included in Note 23 Employee Benefit Plans under the relevant headings. Actual rates may vary significantly from estimates because of unanticipated changes beyond the company’s control.
For 2022, the company used an expected long-term rate of return of 6.6 percent and a discount rate for service costs of 3.5 percent and a discount rate for interest cost of 2.7 percent for the primary U.S. pension plan. The actual return for 2022 was (17.8) percent. For the 10 years ended December 31, 2022, actual asset returns averaged 5.7 percent for this plan. Additionally, with the exception of three years within this 10-year period, actual asset returns for this plan equaled or exceeded 6.6 percent during each year.
Total pension expense for 2022 was $763 million. An increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets or the discount rate would reduce pension plan expense, and vice versa. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the long-term rate of return assumption, a 1 percent increase in this assumption for the company’s primary U.S. pension plan, which accounted for about 55 percent of companywide pension expense, would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2022 by approximately $75 million. A 1 percent increase in the discount rates for this same plan would have reduced pension expense for 2022 by approximately $177 million. 
The aggregate funded status recognized at December 31, 2022, was a net liability of approximately $1.8 billion. An increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation, thus changing the funded status of a plan. At December 31, 2022, the company used a discount rate of 5.2 percent to measure the obligations for the primary U.S. pension plan. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension liabilities to the discount rate assumption, a 0.25 percent increase in the discount rate applied to the company’s primary U.S. pension plan, which accounted for about 63 percent of the companywide pension obligation, would have reduced the plan obligation by approximately $239 million, and would have decreased the plan’s underfunded status from approximately $475 million to $236 million. 
For the company’s OPEB plans, expense for 2022 was $89 million, and the total liability, all unfunded at the end of 2022, was $1.9 billion. For the primary U.S. OPEB plan, the company used a discount rate for service cost of 3.1 percent and a discount rate for interest cost of 2.1 percent to measure expense in 2022, and a 5.2 percent discount rate to measure the benefit obligations at December 31, 2022. Discount rate changes, similar to those used in the pension sensitivity analysis, resulted in an immaterial impact on 2022 OPEB expense and OPEB liabilities at the end of 2022.
Differences between the various assumptions used to determine expense and the funded status of each plan and actual experience are included in actuarial gain/loss. Refer to page 90 in Note 23 Employee Benefit Plans for more information on the $3.4 billion of before-tax actuarial losses recorded by the company as of December 31, 2022. In addition, information related to company contributions is included on page 93 in Note 23 Employee Benefit Plans under the heading “Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments.” 
Contingent Losses Management also makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for claims, litigation, tax matters and environmental remediation. Actual costs can frequently vary from estimates for a variety of reasons. For example, the costs for settlement of claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on culpability and assessments on the amount of damages. Similarly, liabilities for environmental remediation are subject to change because of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation, the determination of additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination, and improvements in technology. 
Under the accounting rules, a liability is generally recorded for these types of contingencies if management determines the loss to be both probable and estimable. The company generally reports these losses as “Operating expenses” or “Selling, general and administrative expenses” on the Consolidated Statement of Income. An exception to this handling is for income tax matters, for which benefits are recognized only if management determines the tax position is more likely than not (i.e., likelihood greater than 50 percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction. For additional discussion of income tax uncertainties, refer to Note 24 Other Contingencies and Commitments under the heading “Income Taxes.” Refer also to the business segment discussions elsewhere in this section for the effect on earnings from losses associated with certain litigation, environmental remediation and tax matters for the three years ended December 31, 2022. 
An estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practicable because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying
