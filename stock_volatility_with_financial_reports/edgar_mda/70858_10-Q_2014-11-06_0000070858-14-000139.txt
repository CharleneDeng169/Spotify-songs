Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 249 Item 6. Exhibits 250 Signature 251 Index to Exhibits 252 2 Table of Contents Item 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This report on Form 10-Q, the documents that it incorporates by reference and the documents into which it may be incorporated by reference may contain, and from time to time Bank of America Corporation (collectively with its subsidiaries, the Corporation) and its management may make, certain statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as "anticipates," "targets," "expects," "hopes," "estimates," "intends," "plans," "goal," "believes," "continue" and other similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as "will," "may," "might," "should," "would" and "could." The forward-looking statements made represent the Corporation's current expectations, plans or forecasts of its future results and revenues, and future business and economic conditions more generally, and other matters. These statements are not guarantees of future results or performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and are often beyond the Corporation's control. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, any of these forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement and should consider the following uncertainties and risks, as well as the risks and uncertainties more fully discussed elsewhere in this report, under Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation's 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K , and in any of the Corporation's subsequent Securities and Exchange Commission filings for further information about factors that could affect such forward-looking statements: the Corporation's ability to resolve representations and warranties repurchase claims made by monolines and private-label and other investors, including as a result of any adverse court rulings, and the chance that the Corporation could face related servicing, securities, fraud, indemnity or other claims from one or more counterparties, including monolines or private-label and other investors; the possibility that final court approval of negotiated settlements is not obtained; the possibility that the court decision with respect to the BNY Mellon Settlement is overturned on appeal in whole or in part; potential claims, damages, penalties and fines resulting from pending or future litigation, governmental proceedings or inquiries, and regulatory proceedings; the possibility that the European Commission will impose remedial measures in relation to its investigation of the Corporation's competitive practices; the possible outcome of LIBOR, other reference rate and foreign exchange inquiries and investigations, including the potential imposition by certain U.S. banking regulators of mandatory remedial measures and penalties associated with the Corporation's foreign exchange business, including the conduct of the business and its systems and controls; the possibility that the Corporation will not obtain waivers from disqualifications for certain activities as a result of the resolution of an SEC action as part of the settlement with the DoJ; the possibility that future representations and warranties losses may occur in excess of the Corporation's recorded liability and estimated range of possible loss for its representations and warranties exposures; the possibility that the Corporation may not collect mortgage insurance claims; the possibility that future claims, damages, penalties and fines may occur in excess of the Corporation's recorded liability and estimated range of possible losses for litigation exposures; uncertainties about the financial stability, growth rates and the geopolitical environment of non-U.S. jurisdictions, the risk that those jurisdictions may face difficulties servicing their sovereign debt, and related stresses on financial markets, currencies and trade, and the Corporation's exposures to such risks, including direct, indirect and operational; the possibility of future inquiries or investigations regarding pending or completed foreclosure activities; the possibility that unexpected foreclosure delays could impact the rate of decline of default-related servicing costs; uncertainty regarding timing and the potential impact of regulatory capital and liquidity requirements (including Basel 3) and regulatory approval of the Corporation's internal analytical models used to calculate risk-weighted assets; the negative impact of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act on the Corporation's businesses and earnings, including as a result of additional regulatory interpretation and rulemaking and the success of the Corporation's actions to mitigate such impacts; the potential impact of implementing and conforming to the Volcker Rule; the potential impact of future derivative regulations; adverse changes to the Corporation's credit ratings from the major credit rating agencies; estimates of the fair value of certain of the Corporation's assets and liabilities; reputational damage that may result from negative publicity, fines and penalties from regulatory violations and judicial proceedings; the Corporation's ability to fully realize the anticipated cost savings in Legacy Assets & Servicing, including in accordance with currently anticipated timeframes; a failure in or breach of the Corporation's operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties with which we do business, including as a result of cyber attacks; the impact on the Corporation's business, financial condition and results of operations of a potential higher interest rate environment; and other similar matters. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Corporation undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that arise after the date the forward-looking statement was made. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements referred to in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) are incorporated by reference into the MD&A.

When used in this report, "the Corporation" may refer to Bank of America Corporation individually, Bank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries, or certain of Bank of America Corporation's subsidiaries or affiliates. Our principal executive offices are located in Charlotte, North Carolina. Through our banking and various nonbanking subsidiaries throughout the U.S. and in international markets, we provide a diversified range of banking and nonbanking financial services and products through five business segments: Consumer & Business Banking (CBB) , Consumer Real Estate Services (CRES) , Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM), Global Banking and Global Markets , with the remaining operations recorded in All Other . Prior to October 1, 2014, we operated our banking activities primarily under two charters: Bank of America, National Association (Bank of America, N.A. or BANA) and, to a lesser extent, FIA Card Services, National Association (FIA Card Services, N.A. or FIA). On October 1, 2014, FIA was merged into BANA. At September 30, 2014 , the Corporation had approximately $2.1 trillion in assets and approximately 230,000 full-time equivalent employees. As of September 30, 2014 , we operated in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and more than 40 countries. Our retail banking footprint covers approximately 80 percent of the U.S. population, and we serve approximately 48 million consumer and small business relationships with approximately 4,900 banking centers, 15,700 ATMs, nationwide call centers, and leading online (www.bankofamerica.com) and mobile banking platforms. We offer industry-leading support to more than three million small business owners. We are a global leader in corporate and investment banking and trading across a broad range of asset classes serving corporations, governments, institutions and individuals around the world. Third-Quarter 2014 Economic and Business Environment In the U.S., economic growth remained relatively stable in the third quarter of 2014 following a rebound in the second quarter of 2014. Moderate retail spending gains, highlighted by continued steady business and residential investment, and sustained export gains characterized the economic environment in the U.S. Employment gains softened during the quarter and the unemployment rate stabilized. Inflation remained below the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System's (Federal Reserve) longer-term target of two percent. Amid continued international tensions and expectations that accommodative monetary policy would be only gradually removed, longer-term U.S. Treasury yields declined during the quarter, while equity markets remained relatively unchanged. The Federal Reserve continued to reduce its securities purchases, bringing targeted monthly purchases to $15 billion in October. In October, the Federal Reserve announced that it will end its securities purchases in the fourth quarter of 2014. Internationally, subdued economic growth continued in the eurozone in the third quarter of 2014 , while healthy expansion continued in the U.K. Japan's economy stabilized and China's economy grew moderately in the third quarter of 2014. Growth in Russia and Brazil continued to decelerate with political uncertainties and declining commodity prices. For more information on our international exposure, see Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 114 . 4 Table of Contents Recent Events Foreign Exchange Inquiries and Litigation Subsequent to our October 15, 2014 earnings announcement for the quarter ended September 30, 2014, the Corporation has been engaged in separate advanced discussions with certain U.S. banking regulatory agencies to resolve matters related to our foreign exchange (FX) business (FX Matters). There can be no assurances that these discussions will lead to a resolution of these matters, or of the amounts for and time frames within which such resolution might be obtained. As a result of those discussions, the Corporation recorded a $400 million non-deductible charge and adjusted the third-quarter 2014 financial results reported on October 15, 2014 to a net loss of $232 million . For additional information, see Global Markets on page 48 and Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Department of Justice Settlement On August 20, 2014, the Corporation reached a comprehensive settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ), certain federal agencies and six states (DoJ Settlement). The settlement included releases on the securitization, origination, sale and other specified conduct relating to residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), and an origination release on residential mortgage loans sold to government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) and private-label RMBS trusts, or guaranteed by the Federal Housing Authority (FHA). The DoJ Settlement resolved certain actual and potential civil claims by the DoJ, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and State Attorneys General from six states (State AGs), the FHA and the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA), as well as all pending RMBS claims against Bank of America entities brought by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Under the DoJ Settlement, the Corporation agreed to pay a total of $9.65 billion in cash and provide $7.0 billion worth of consumer relief. The cash portion consists of $5.02 billion in civil monetary penalties and $4.63 billion in compensatory remediation payments, of which $9.16 billion was paid in October 2014 with the balance paid in November 2014. After considering previously established reserves, we recorded a pretax charge of $5.3 billion in the third quarter of 2014 to pay the costs associated with the DoJ Settlement. Of this third-quarter charge, $4.9 billion was recorded in litigation expense and $400 million was recorded in the provision for credit losses for additional costs associated with the consumer relief portion of the settlement. For additional information, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Department of Justice Settlement on page 59 and Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Dividends On August 6, 2014, the Federal Reserve informed us that it did not object to our requested capital actions, which included an increase in the common stock dividend, but no additional common stock repurchases. The requested capital actions cover the period from the third quarter of 2014 through the first quarter of 2015. On August 6, 2014, our Board of Directors (the Board) approved an increase in the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.05 per share, from $0.01 per share, for the third-quarter dividend paid on September 26, 2014. On October 23, 2014, our Board declared our fourth-quarter common stock dividend of $0.05 per share, payable on December 26, 2014 to shareholders of record as of December 5, 2014. For additional information, see Capital Management on page 64 . BANA / FIA Merger Prior to October 1, 2014, we operated our banking activities primarily under two charters: BANA and, to a lesser extent, FIA. On October 1, 2014, FIA was merged into BANA. See Capital Management Bank of America, N.A. and FIA Card Services, N.A. Regulatory Capital on page 70 and Capital Management Other Regulatory Capital Matters on page 71 for additional information including the capital amounts and ratios as of September 30, 2014 . 5 Table of Contents Regulatory Activities Liquidity Coverage Ratio On September 3, 2014, the U.S. banking agencies finalized the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) rule. The LCR is a measure of short-term liquidity intended to ensure that a banking organization maintains a sufficient pool of liquid assets to cover net cash outflows over a 30-day stress period. The rule is subject to a two-year phase-in from January 2015 to full implementation in January 2017. For additional information, see Liquidity Risk Basel 3 Liquidity Standards on page 76 . Supplementary Leverage Ratio On September 3, 2014, the U.S. banking agencies finalized the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) rule. Effective January 1, 2018, the Corporation will be required to maintain a minimum SLR of three percent, plus a supplementary leverage buffer of two percent, for a total of five percent. In addition, insured depository institutions of such bank holding companies, which for the Corporation is primarily BANA, will be required to maintain a minimum six percent SLR to be considered "well capitalized." For additional information, see Capital Management Other Regulatory Capital Matters on page 71 . Credit Risk Retention In October 2014, U.S. regulators jointly approved a final rule regarding credit risk retention that will, among other things, require sponsors in certain circumstances to retain at least five percent of the credit risk of the assets underlying certain securitizations. The rule will become effective after it is published in the Federal Register, one year after for RMBS and two years after for all other asset classes. For additional information, see Regulatory Matters Credit Risk Retention on page 63 . 6 Table of Contents Selected Financial Data Table 1 provides selected consolidated financial data for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013 , and at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 .

(2) The diluted earnings (loss) per common share excludes the effect of any equity instruments that are antidilutive to earnings per share. There were no potential common shares that were dilutive in the third quarter of 2014 because of the net loss applicable to common shareholders. (3) Balances and ratios do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. For additional exclusions from nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Nonperforming Consumer Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity on page 100 and corresponding Table 46 , and Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity on page 109 and corresponding Table 55 . (4) Net charge-offs exclude $246 million and $797 million of write-offs in the purchased credit-impaired loan portfolio for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $443 million and $1.6 billion for the same periods in 2013 . These write-offs decreased the purchased credit-impaired valuation allowance included as part of the allowance for loan and lease losses. For more information on purchased credit-impaired write-offs, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio on page 95 . (5) On January 1, 2014, the Basel 3 rules became effective, subject to transition provisions primarily related to regulatory deductions and adjustments impacting common equity tier 1 capital and Tier 1 capital. We reported under Basel 1 (which included the Market Risk Final Rules) at December 31, 2013. n/a = not applicable n/m = not meaningful 7 Table of Contents Financial Highlights The results for the three months ended September 30, 2014 were a net loss of $232 million , or a loss of $0.04 per share, and net income of $1.8 billion , or $0.10 per diluted share for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to net income of $2.5 billion , or $0.20 and $8.0 billion , or $0.62 for the same periods in 2013 . Litigation expense increased $4.9 billion and $12.2 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 , as the result of the DoJ Settlement and other litigation charges, and in the nine-month period, also the settlement with the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). Table 2 Summary Income Statement Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 (Dollars in millions) 2014 2013 2014 2013 Net interest income (FTE basis) (1) $ 10,444 $ 10,479 $ 30,956 $ 32,125 Noninterest income 10,990 11,264 35,205 35,975 Total revenue, net of interest expense (FTE basis) (1) 21,434 21,743 66,161 68,100 Provision for credit losses 636 296 2,056 3,220 Noninterest expense 20,142 16,389 60,921 51,907 Income before income taxes 656 5,058 3,184 12,973 Income tax expense (FTE basis) (1) 888 2,561 1,401 4,981 Net income (loss) (232 ) 2,497 1,783 7,992 Preferred stock dividends 238 279 732 1,093 Net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders $ (470 ) $ 2,218 $ 1,051 $ 6,899 Per common share information Earnings (loss) $ (0.04 ) $ 0.21 $ 0.10 $ 0.64 Diluted earnings (loss) (0.04 ) 0.20 0.10 0.62 (1) FTE basis is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information on this measure and for a corresponding reconciliation to GAAP financial measures, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 17 . Net Interest Income Net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis decreased $35 million to $10.4 billion , and $1.2 billion to $31.0 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in 2013 . The net interest yield on an FTE basis decreased four basis points (bps) to 2.29 percent , and eight bps to 2.27 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in 2013 . The decreases were primarily due to lower loan yields, lower consumer loan balances and lower income from the asset and liability management (ALM) portfolio, partially offset by reductions in funding yields and balances and higher commercial loan balances. In addition to the factors described above, the nine-month decrease was also driven by the impact of market-related premium amortization on debt securities, which declined $1.1 billion from a benefit of $575 million to an expense of $531 million, as well as lower trading-related net interest income. For more information on the decreases in net interest income and net interest yield, see Supplemental Financial Data Net Interest Income Excluding Trading-related Net Interest Income on page 21 . 8 Table of Contents Noninterest Income Table 3 Noninterest Income Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 (Dollars in millions) 2014 2013 2014 2013 Card income $ 1,500 $ 1,444 $ 4,334 $ 4,323 Service charges 1,907 1,884 5,599 5,520 Investment and brokerage services 3,327 2,995 9,887 9,165 Investment banking income 1,351 1,297 4,524 4,388 Equity investment income 9 1,184 1,150 2,427 Trading account profits 1,899 1,266 6,198 6,193 Mortgage banking income 272 585 1,211 3,026 Gains on sales of debt securities 432 356 1,191 881 Other income 293 253 1,111 52 Total noninterest income $ 10,990 $ 11,264 $ 35,205 $ 35,975 Noninterest income decreased $274 million to $11.0 billion , and $770 million to $35.2 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in 2013 . The following highlights the significant changes. Investment and brokerage services income increased $332 million and $722 million primarily driven by increased asset management fees from higher market levels and the impact of long-term assets under management (AUM) inflows. Equity investment income decreased $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion . The declines were primarily due to a $753 million gain on the sale of our remaining investment in China Construction Bank Corporation (CCB) and gains on the sales of a portion of an equity investment in All Other for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013. The nine months ended September 30, 2014 included gains on the sales of a portion of an equity investment in All Other and a gain related to an initial public offering of an equity investment in Global Markets. Trading account profits increased $633 million and $5 million and included positive debit valuation adjustments (DVA) on derivatives of $68 million and negative DVA of $16 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to negative DVA of $292 million and $309 million for the same periods in 2013 . Excluding net DVA, trading account profits increased $273 million and decreased $288 million compared to the same periods in 2013 . The three-month improvement was primarily due to increased market volatility and client activity and the nine-month decline was due to lower market volumes and volatility. Mortgage banking income decreased $313 million and $1.8 billion primarily driven by lower servicing income and core production revenue, partially offset by lower representations and warranties provision. Other income increased $40 million and $1.1 billion due to increases of $289 million and $634 million in net DVA on structured liabilities and gains associated with the bulk sales of residential mortgage loans. These gains were partially offset by increases in U.K. consumer payment protection insurance (PPI) costs compared to the same periods in 2013. The first quarter of 2013 also included a write-down of $450 million on a monoline receivable. Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses increased $340 million to $636 million , and decreased $1.2 billion to $2.1 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in 2013 . The provision for credit losses was $407 million and $1.4 billion lower than net charge-offs, resulting in reductions in the allowance for credit losses. The three-month increase in the provision was due to $400 million of additional costs associated with the consumer relief portion of the DoJ Settlement. The reduction in the provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 was driven by portfolio improvement, including increased home prices in the home loans portfolio, as well as lower levels of delinquencies in the consumer lending portfolio within CBB, and improved asset quality in the commercial portfolio. Net charge-offs totaled $1.0 billion , or 0.46 percent , and $3.5 billion , or 0.52 percent of average loans and leases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $1.7 billion , or 0.73 percent , and $6.3 billion , or 0.93 percent for the same periods in 2013 . The decreases in net charge-offs were due to credit quality improvement across all major portfolios. For more information on the provision for credit losses, see Provision for Credit Losses on page 116 . 9 Table of Contents Noninterest Expense Table 4 Noninterest Expense Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 (Dollars in millions) 2014 2013 2014 2013 Personnel $ 8,039 $ 8,310 $ 26,094 $ 26,732 Occupancy 1,070 1,096 3,264 3,359 Equipment 514 538 1,594 1,620 Marketing 446 511 1,338 1,377 Professional fees 611 702 1,795 2,045 Amortization of intangibles 234 270 708 820 Data processing 754 779 2,348 2,370 Telecommunications 311 397 1,005 1,217 Other general operating 8,163 3,786 22,775 12,367 Total noninterest expense $ 20,142 $ 16,389 $ 60,921 $ 51,907 Noninterest expense increased $3.8 billion to $20.1 billion , and $9.0 billion to $60.9 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in 2013 , primarily driven by higher litigation expense in other general operating expense. Litigation expense increased $4.9 billion to $6.0 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2014 driven by the DoJ Settlement and other litigation charges, and increased $12.2 billion to $16.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 also due to the settlement with FHFA. Personnel expense decreased $271 million and $638 million as we continued to streamline processes and achieve cost savings. In connection with Project New BAC, which was first announced in the third quarter of 2011, we expected to achieve cost savings in certain noninterest expense categories as we streamlined workflows, simplified processes and aligned expenses with our overall strategic plan and operating principles. We expected total cost savings from Project New BAC to reach $8 billion on an annualized basis, or $2 billion per quarter, by mid-2015. During the three months ended September 30, 2014 , we successfully completed our Project New BAC expense program ahead of schedule by reaching our target of $2 billion in cost savings per quarter. Income Tax Expense Table 5 Income Tax Expense Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 (Dollars in millions) 2014 2013 2014 2013 Income before income taxes $ 431 $ 4,845 $ 2,545 $ 12,327 Income tax expense 663 2,348 762 4,335 Effective tax rate 153.8 % 48.5 % 29.9 % 35.2 % The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2014 was driven by the non-deductible treatment of charges for the FX Matters and for a portion of the DoJ Settlement, partially offset by recurring tax preference items, the impact of the resolution of several tax examinations and tax benefits from a non-U.S. restructuring. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 was impacted by the recurring preference and other tax benefit items previously mentioned, which more than offset the impact of the non-deductible charges. We expect an effective tax rate of approximately 31 percent, absent any unusual items, for the fourth quarter of 2014. The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013 were primarily driven by the $1.1 billion negative impact of the U.K. corporate income tax rate reduction enacted in July 2013 on deferred tax assets, partially offset by our recurring tax preference items. Also reflected in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 was an increase in benefits from the 2012 non-U.S. restructurings. 10 Table of Contents Balance Sheet Overview Table 6 Selected Balance Sheet Data Average Balance September 30 2014 December 31 2013 % Change Three Months Ended September 30 % Change Nine Months Ended September 30 % Change (Dollars in millions) 2014 2013 2014 2013 Assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 128,659 $ 131,322 (2 )% $ 135,996 $ 113,064 20 % $ 142,577 $ 103,540 38 % Federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell 223,310 190,328 17 223,978 223,434 224,001 231,379 (3 ) Trading account assets 188,489 200,993 (6 ) 202,385 194,324 4 202,439 220,343 (8 ) Debt securities 368,124 323,945 14 359,653 327,493 10 345,194 342,278 1 Loans and leases 891,315 928,233 (4 ) 899,241 923,978 (3 ) 910,360 914,888 Allowance for loan and lease losses (15,106 ) (17,428 ) (13 ) (15,538 ) (20,473 ) (24 ) (16,352 ) (22,031 ) (26 ) All other assets 338,822 344,880 (2 ) 330,394 361,610 (9 ) 340,079 382,767 (11 ) Total assets $ 2,123,613 $ 2,102,273 1 $ 2,136,109 $ 2,123,430 1 $ 2,148,298 $ 2,173,164 (1 ) Liabilities Deposits $ 1,111,981 $ 1,119,271 (1 ) $ 1,127,488 $ 1,090,611 3 $ 1,124,777 $ 1,082,005 4 Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase 217,925 198,106 10 216,244 235,205 (8 ) 214,566 268,737 (20 ) Trading account liabilities 76,867 83,469 (8 ) 84,988 84,648 90,176 90,321 Short-term borrowings 33,275 45,999 (28 ) 38,866 44,220 (12 ) 45,218 42,749 6 Long-term debt 250,115 249,674 251,772 258,717 (3 ) 255,084 267,582 (5 ) All other liabilities 194,769 173,069 13 178,717 179,637 (1 ) 181,677 187,644 (3 ) Total liabilities 1,884,932 1,869,588 1 1,898,075 1,893,038 1,911,498 1,939,038 (1 ) Shareholders' equity 238,681 232,685 3 238,034 230,392 3 236,800 234,126 1 Total liabilities and shareholders' equity $ 2,123,613 $ 2,102,273 1 $ 2,136,109 $ 2,123,430 1 $ 2,148,298 $ 2,173,164 (1 ) Period-end balance sheet amounts may vary from average balance sheet amounts due to liquidity and balance sheet management activities, primarily involving our portfolios of highly liquid assets. These portfolios are designed to ensure the adequacy of capital while enhancing our ability to manage liquidity requirements for the Corporation and our customers, and to position the balance sheet in accordance with the Corporation's risk appetite. The execution of these activities requires the use of balance sheet and capital-related limits including spot, average and risk-weighted asset limits, particularly within the market-making activities of our trading businesses. One of our key regulatory metrics, Tier 1 leverage ratio, is calculated based on adjusted quarterly average total assets. Balance Sheet Management Actions in Third Quarter 2014 The Corporation took certain actions in the third quarter of 2014 to further optimize the balance sheet, resulting in a decrease in total assets of $47 billion compared to June 30, 2014. We shifted the mix of certain discretionary assets out of less liquid loans to more liquid debt securities. This included the conversion of $6.5 billion of residential mortgage loans with standby insurance agreements into agency securities and the sale of $2.5 billion of nonperforming and delinquent loans. We reduced the Global Markets balance sheet and associated funding by $11.7 billion, including a decrease of $3.3 billion in low-margin prime brokerage loans. The $22 billion decline in deposits was also driven by optimization efforts, including the reduction of deposits with less LCR benefit. Additionally, from a capital standpoint, $3.1 billion of preferred stock was issued in the quarter improving Basel 3 Tier 1 regulatory capital at the parent company. Balance Sheet Analysis Assets At September 30, 2014 , total assets were approximately $2.1 trillion , up $21.3 billion from December 31, 2013 . The key drivers were increased debt securities due to purchases of U.S. treasuries, and higher securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell from higher matched-book trading activity. These increases were partially offset by a decline in consumer loan balances due to paydowns, net charge-offs and nonperforming and delinquent loan sales outpacing new originations, a reduction in trading account assets, and a decline in commercial loan balances. 11 Table of Contents Average total assets increased $12.7 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 . The increase was driven by increases in cash and cash equivalents primarily driven by higher interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and non-U.S. central banks in connection with anticipated Basel 3 LCR requirements and increases in debt securities due to purchases of U.S. treasuries. These increases were partially offset by declines in consumer balances due to paydowns, net charge-offs and nonperforming and delinquent loan sales outpacing new originations, and declines in all other assets driven by decreases in customer and other receivables and time deposits placed. Average total assets decreased $24.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 . The decrease was driven by declines in all other assets primarily due to decreases in other earning assets, customer and other receivables, derivative dealer assets and loans held-for-sale (LHFS). The decrease in average total assets was also driven by a decline in trading account assets due to a reduction in U.S. treasuries inventory and agency pass-throughs, and a decline in securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell due to a lower matched-book. The decrease in average total assets was partially offset by increases in cash and cash equivalents primarily driven by higher interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and non-U.S. central banks. Liabilities and Shareholders' Equity At September 30, 2014 , total liabilities were approximately $1.9 trillion , up $15.3 billion from December 31, 2013 , driven by an increase in all other liabilities primarily from higher payables primarily related to litigation, and higher securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase due to an increase in matched-book trading activity. The increases were partially offset by planned reductions in other short-term borrowings and a decline in deposits. Average total liabilities increased $5.0 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 driven by growth in deposits. This increase was partially offset by planned reductions in securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, long-term debt as maturities outpaced new issuances, and short-term borrowings. Average total liabilities decreased $27.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 . The decrease was due to lower matched-booked trading activity and planned reductions in securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, planned reductions in long-term debt as maturities outpaced new issuances, and decreases in derivative liabilities. These decreases were partially offset by growth in deposits. Shareholders' equity of $238.7 billion at September 30, 2014 increased $6.0 billion from December 31, 2013 driven by issuances of preferred stock and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) driven by a positive net change in the fair value of available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities, partially offset by common stock repurchases. Average shareholders' equity of $238.0 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2014 increased $7.6 billion from the same period in 2013 driven by increased retained earnings, an increase in accumulated OCI driven by a positive net change in the fair value of AFS debt securities, and preferred stock issuances, partially offset by common stock repurchases. Average shareholders' equity of $236.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 increased $2.7 billion from the same period in 2013 driven by increased retained earnings, partially offset by common stock repurchases. 12 Table of Contents Table 7 Selected Quarterly Financial Data 2014 Quarters 2013 Quarters (In millions, except per share information) Third Second First Fourth Third Income statement Net interest income $ 10,219 $ 10,013 $ 10,085 $ 10,786 $ 10,266 Noninterest income 10,990 11,734 12,481 10,702 11,264 Total revenue, net of interest expense 21,209 21,747 22,566 21,488 21,530 Provision for credit losses 636 411 1,009 336 296 Noninterest expense 20,142 18,541 22,238 17,307 16,389 Income (loss) before income taxes 431 2,795 (681 ) 3,845 4,845 Income tax expense (benefit) 663 504 (405 ) 406 2,348 Net income (loss) (232 ) 2,291 (276 ) 3,439 2,497 Net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders (470 ) 2,035 (514 ) 3,183 2,218 Average common shares issued and outstanding 10,516 10,519 10,561 10,633 10,719 Average diluted common shares issued and outstanding (1) 10,516 11,265 10,561 11,404 11,482 Performance ratios Return on average assets n/m 0.42 % n/m 0.64 % 0.47 % Four quarter trailing return on average assets (2) 0.24 % 0.37 0.45 % 0.53 0.40 Return on average common shareholders' equity n/m 3.68 n/m 5.74 4.06 Return on average tangible common shareholders' equity (3) n/m 5.47 n/m 8.61 6.15 Return on average tangible shareholders' equity (3) n/m 5.64 n/m 8.53 6.32 Total ending equity to total ending assets 11.24 10.94 10.79 11.07 10.92 Total average equity to total average assets 11.14 10.87 11.06 10.93 10.85 Dividend payout n/m 5.16 n/m 3.33 4.82 Per common share data Earnings (loss) $ (0.04 ) $ 0.19 $ (0.05 ) $ 0.30 $ 0.21 Diluted earnings (loss) (1) (0.04 ) 0.19 (0.05 ) 0.29 0.20 Dividends paid 0.05 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 Book value 20.99 21.16 20.75 20.71 20.50 Tangible book value (3) 14.09 14.24 13.81 13.79 13.62 Market price per share of common stock Closing $ 17.05 $ 15.37 $ 17.20 $ 15.57 $ 13.80 High closing 17.18 17.34 17.92 15.88 14.95 Low closing 14.98 14.51 16.10 13.69 12.83 Market capitalization $ 179,296 $ 161,628 $ 181,117 $ 164,914 $ 147,429 (1) The diluted earnings (loss) per common share excluded the effect of any equity instruments that are antidilutive to earnings per share.

We believe managing the business with net interest income on an FTE basis provides a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. Certain performance measures including the efficiency ratio and net interest yield utilize net interest income (and thus total revenue) on an FTE basis. The efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue, and net interest yield measures the bps we earn over the cost of funds. We also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents an adjusted shareholders' equity or common shareholders' equity amount which has been reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)), net of related deferred tax liabilities. These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models use both return on average tangible common shareholders' equity and return on average tangible shareholders' equity as key measures to support our overall growth goals. These ratios are as follows: Return on average tangible common shareholders' equity measures our earnings contribution as a percentage of adjusted common shareholders' equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders' equity divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on average tangible shareholders' equity measures our earnings contribution as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders' equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders' equity divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders' equity divided by ending common shares outstanding. The aforementioned supplemental data and performance measures are presented in Tables 7 and 8 . We evaluate our business segment results based on measures that utilize average allocated capital. Return on average allocated capital is calculated as net income adjusted for cost of funds and earnings credits and certain expenses related to intangibles, divided by average allocated capital. Allocated capital and the related return both represent non-GAAP financial measures. In addition, for purposes of goodwill impairment testing, the Corporation utilizes allocated equity as a proxy for the carrying value of its reporting units. Allocated equity in the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting unit. For additional information, see Business Segment Operations on page 28 and Note 8 Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Tables 9 , 10 and 11 provide reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures. We believe the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides additional clarity in assessing the results of the Corporation and our segments.

As discussed in Global Markets on page 48 , we evaluate our sales and trading results and strategies on a total market-based revenue approach by combining net interest income and noninterest income for Global Markets . An analysis of net interest income, average earning assets and net interest yield on earning assets, all of which adjust for the impact of trading-related net interest income from reported net interest income on an FTE basis, is shown below. We believe the use of this non-GAAP presentation in Table 12 provides additional clarity in assessing our results. Table 12 Net Interest Income Excluding Trading-related Net Interest Income Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 (Dollars in millions) 2014 2013 2014 2013 Net interest income (FTE basis) As reported $ 10,444 $ 10,479 $ 30,956 $ 32,125 Impact of trading-related net interest income (900 ) (883 ) (2,658 ) (2,806 ) Net interest income excluding trading-related net interest income (1) $ 9,544 $ 9,596 $ 28,298 $ 29,319 Average earning assets (2) As reported $ 1,813,482 $ 1,789,045 $ 1,819,247 $ 1,826,575 Impact of trading-related earning assets (441,661 ) (446,181 ) (449,248 ) (476,853 ) Average earning assets excluding trading-related earning assets (1) $ 1,371,821 $ 1,342,864 $ 1,369,999 $ 1,349,722 Net interest yield contribution (FTE basis) (2, 3) As reported 2.29 % 2.33 % 2.27 % 2.35 % Impact of trading-related activities 0.47 0.51 0.48 0.55 Net interest yield on earning assets excluding trading-related activities (1) 2.76 % 2.84 % 2.75 % 2.90 % (1) Represents a non-GAAP financial measure. (2) Beginning in 2014, interest-bearing deposits placed with the Federal Reserve and certain non-U.S. central banks are included in earning assets. In prior periods, these balances were included with cash and due from banks in the cash and cash equivalents line, consistent with the Consolidated Balance Sheet presentation. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. (3) Calculated on an annualized basis. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 , net interest income excluding trading-related net interest income decreased $52 million to $9.5 billion , and $1.0 billion to $28.3 billion compared to the same periods in 2013 . The decreases were primarily due to lower loan yields, lower consumer loan balances and lower income from the asset and liability management (ALM) portfolio, partially offset by reductions in funding yields and balances and higher commercial loan balances. In addition to the factors described above, the nine-month decrease was also driven by the impact of market-related premium amortization on debt securities, which declined $1.1 billion from a benefit of $575 million to an expense of $531 million. For more information on the impact of interest rates, see Interest Rate Risk Management for Non-trading Activities on page 128 . Average earning assets excluding trading-related earning assets for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 increased $29.0 billion to $1,371.8 billion , and $20.3 billion to $1,370.0 billion compared to the same periods in 2013 . The increases were primarily in interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and commercial loans, partially offset by declines in other earning assets and consumer loans. An increase in investment securities also contributed to the increase for the three months ended September 30, 2014 . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 , net interest yield on earning assets excluding trading-related activities decreased eight bps to 2.76 percent , and 15 bps to 2.75 percent compared to the same periods in 2013 due to the same factors as described above. 21 Table of Contents Table 13 Quarterly Average Balances and Interest Rates FTE Basis Third Quarter 2014 Second Quarter 2014 (Dollars in millions) Average Balance Interest Income/ Expense Yield/ Rate Average Balance Interest Income/ Expense Yield/ Rate Earning assets Interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and non-U.S. central banks (1) $ 110,876 $ 77 0.28 % $ 123,582 $ 85 0.28 % Time deposits placed and other short-term investments 10,457 41 1.54 10,509 39 1.51 Federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell 223,978 239 0.42 235,393 297 0.51 Trading account assets 143,282 1,148 3.18 147,798 1,214 3.29 Debt securities (2) 359,653 2,236 2.48 345,889 2,134 2.46 Loans and leases (3) : Residential mortgage (4) 235,271 2,083 3.54 243,405 2,195 3.61 Home equity 88,590 836 3.76 90,729 842 3.72 U.S. credit card 88,866 2,093 9.34 88,058 2,042 9.30 Non-U.S. credit card 11,784 304 10.25 11,759 308 10.51 Direct/Indirect consumer (5) 82,669 523 2.51 82,102 524 2.56 Other consumer (6) 2,111 19 3.44 2,012 17 3.60 Total consumer 509,291 5,858 4.58 518,065 5,928 4.58 U.S. commercial 230,891 1,659 2.85 230,486 1,673 2.91 Commercial real estate (7) 46,071 344 2.96 48,315 357 2.97 Commercial lease financing 24,325 211 3.48 24,409 193 3.16 Non-U.S. commercial 88,663 560 2.51 91,305 569 2.50 Total commercial 389,950 2,774 2.83 394,515 2,792 2.84 Total loans and leases 899,241 8,632 3.82 912,580 8,720 3.83 Other earning assets 65,995 710 4.27 65,099 665 4.09 Total earning assets (8) 1,813,482 13,083 2.87 1,840,850 13,154 2.86 Cash and due from banks (1) 25,120 27,377 Other assets, less allowance for loan and lease losses 297,507 301,328 Total assets $ 2,136,109 $ 2,169,555 (1) Beginning in 2014, interest-bearing deposits placed with the Federal Reserve and certain non-U.S. central banks are included in earning assets.

In prior periods, these balances were included with cash and due from banks in the cash and cash equivalents line, consistent with the Consolidated Balance Sheet presentation. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. (2) Beginning in 2014, yields on debt securities carried at fair value are calculated on the cost basis. Prior to 2014, yields on debt securities carried at fair value were calculated based on fair value rather than the cost basis. The use of fair value does not have a material impact on net interest yield. (3) Nonperforming loans are included in the respective average loan balances. Income on these nonperforming loans is generally recognized on a cost recovery basis. PCI loans were recorded at fair value upon acquisition and accrete interest income over the remaining life of the loan.

For more information on this measure and for a corresponding reconciliation to a GAAP financial measure, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 17 . The management accounting and reporting process derives segment and business results by utilizing allocation methodologies for revenue and expense. The net income derived for the businesses is dependent upon revenue and cost allocations using an activity-based costing model, funds transfer pricing, and other methodologies and assumptions management believes are appropriate to reflect the results of the business. Total revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest income on an FTE basis and noninterest income. The adjustment of net interest income to an FTE basis results in a corresponding increase in income tax expense. The segment results also reflect certain revenue and expense methodologies that are utilized to determine net income. The net interest income of the businesses includes the results of a funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics. In segments where the total of liabilities and equity exceeds assets, which are generally deposit-taking segments, we allocate assets to match liabilities. Net interest income of the business segments also includes an allocation of net interest income generated by certain of our ALM activities. 28 Table of Contents Our ALM activities include an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of various derivatives and cash instruments to manage fluctuations in earnings and capital that are caused by interest rate volatility. Our goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital. The results of a majority of our ALM activities are allocated to the business segments and fluctuate based on the performance of the ALM activities. ALM activities include external product pricing decisions including deposit pricing strategies, the effects of our internal funds transfer pricing process and the net effects of other ALM activities. Certain expenses not directly attributable to a specific business segment are allocated to the segments. The most significant of these expenses include data and item processing costs and certain centralized or shared functions. Data processing costs are allocated to the segments based on equipment usage. Item processing costs are allocated to the segments based on the volume of items processed for each segment. The costs of certain other centralized or shared functions are allocated based on methodologies that reflect utilization. The Corporation periodically reviews capital allocated to its businesses and allocates capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. We utilize a methodology that considers the effect of regulatory capital requirements in addition to internal risk-based capital models. The Corporation's internal risk-based capital models use a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment's credit, market, interest rate, business and operational risk components. For more information on the nature of these risks, see Managing Risk and Strategic Risk Management on page 63 . The capital allocated to the business segments is referred to as allocated capital, which represents a non-GAAP financial measure. For purposes of goodwill impairment testing, the Corporation utilizes allocated equity as a proxy for the carrying value of its reporting units. Allocated equity in the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting unit. For additional information, see Note 8 Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements . During the latest annual planning process, we made refinements to the amount of capital allocated to each of our businesses based on multiple considerations that included, but were not limited to, Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced risk-weighted assets, business segment exposures and risk profile, and strategic plans. As a result of this process, in 2014, we adjusted the amount of capital being allocated to our business segments.

CBB Results Three Months Ended September 30, 2014 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2013 Net income for CBB increased $69 million to $1.9 billion primarily driven by lower provision for credit losses and higher noninterest income, partially offset by lower net interest income. Net interest income decreased $104 million to $5.0 billion due to lower average loan balances and card yields, partially offset by higher deposit balances. Noninterest income increased $91 million to $2.6 billion primarily due to higher deposit service charges and card income. The provision for credit losses decreased $144 million to $617 million primarily as a result of improvements in credit quality. Noninterest expense of $4.0 billion remained relatively unchanged. The return on average allocated capital was 24.97 percent , up from 23.67 percent , reflecting an increase in net income combined with a small decrease in allocated capital. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 28 . 31 Table of Contents Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2013 Net income for CBB increased $689 million to $5.3 billion primarily driven by lower provision for credit losses, lower noninterest expense and higher noninterest income, partially offset by lower net interest income. Net interest income decreased $271 million to $14.8 billion driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above. Noninterest income increased $222 million to $7.5 billion primarily due to portfolio divestiture gains and higher service charges, partially offset by lower revenue from consumer protection products. The provision for credit losses decreased $717 million to $2.0 billion driven by the same factor as described in the three-month discussion above. Noninterest expense decreased $375 million to $11.9 billion primarily driven by lower operating, FDIC and litigation expenses. The return on average allocated capital was 24.16 percent , up from 20.70 percent , reflecting an increase in net income combined with a small decrease in allocated capital.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2014 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2013 Net income for Deposits increased $235 million to $799 million driven by higher revenue, and lower noninterest expense and provision for credit losses. Net interest income increased $135 million to $2.6 billion primarily driven by a combination of pricing discipline and the beneficial impact of an increase in investable assets as a result of higher deposit balances. Noninterest income increased $94 million to $1.3 billion primarily due to higher deposit service charges. The provision for credit losses decreased $35 million to $61 million as a result of a slight improvement in credit quality. Noninterest expense decreased $109 million to $2.6 billion due to lower operating expenses, partially offset by higher personnel and litigation expenses. Average deposits increased $22.8 billion to $544.3 billion driven by a continuing customer shift to more liquid products in the low rate environment. Growth in checking, traditional savings and money market savings of $33.5 billion was partially offset by a decline in time deposits of $10.7 billion. As a result of our continued pricing discipline and the shift in the mix of deposits, the rate paid on average deposits declined by four bps to six bps . 32 Table of Contents Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2013 Net income for Deposits increased $723 million to $2.2 billion driven by higher revenue and a decrease in noninterest expense.

CRES operations include Home Loans and Legacy Assets & Servicing. Home Loans is responsible for ongoing residential first mortgage and home equity loan production activities and the CRES home equity loan portfolio not selected for inclusion in the Legacy Assets & Servicing owned portfolio. Legacy Assets & Servicing is responsible for our mortgage servicing activities related to loans serviced for others and loans held by the Corporation, including loans that have been designated as the Legacy Assets & Servicing Portfolios. The Legacy Assets & Servicing Portfolios (both owned and serviced), herein referred to as the Legacy Owned and Legacy Serviced Portfolios, respectively (together, the Legacy Portfolios), and as further defined below, include those loans originated prior to January 1, 2011 that would not have been originated under our established underwriting standards as of December 31, 2010. For more information on our Legacy Portfolios , see page 38 . In addition, Legacy Assets & Servicing is responsible for managing legacy exposures related to CRES (e.g., litigation, representations and warranties). This alignment allows CRES management to lead the ongoing Home Loans business while also providing focus on legacy mortgage issues and servicing activities. CRES , primarily through its Home Loans operations, generates revenue by providing an extensive line of consumer real estate products and services to customers nationwide. CRES products offered by Home Loans include fixed- and adjustable-rate first-lien mortgage loans for home purchase and refinancing needs, home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) and home equity loans. First mortgage products are generally either sold into the secondary mortgage market to investors, while we retain MSRs (which are on the balance sheet of Legacy Assets & Servicing) and the Bank of America customer relationships, or are held on the balance sheet in Home Loans or in All Other for ALM purposes . Home Loans is compensated for loans held for ALM purposes on a management accounting basis with the corresponding offset in All Other . Newly originated HELOCs and home equity loans are retained on the CRES balance sheet in Home Loans. CRES includes the impact of migrating certain customers and their related loan balances from GWIM to CRES . 36 Table of Contents CRES Results Three Months Ended September 30, 2014 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2013 The net loss for CRES increased $4.2 billion to a net loss of $5.2 billion primarily driven by higher litigation expense, which is included in noninterest expense, related to the DoJ Settlement and a lower tax benefit rate resulting from the non-deductible treatment of a portion of the DoJ Settlement, higher provision for credit losses and lower mortgage banking income. Mortgage banking income decreased $417 million due to both lower servicing income and lower core production revenue, partially offset by lower representations and warranties provision. The provision for credit losses increased $594 million due to $400 million of additional costs associated with the consumer relief portion of the DoJ Settlement and a slower pace of credit quality improvement. Noninterest expense increased $3.9 billion due to a $5.0 billion increase in litigation expense primarily for the DoJ Settlement. Excluding litigation, noninterest expense decreased $1.1 billion to $2.0 billion due to a decline in default-related servicing expenses and lower mortgage-related assessments, waivers and similar costs related to foreclosure delays in Legacy Assets & Servicing and a decline in personnel expense resulting from lower loan originations in Home Loans. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2013 The net loss for CRES increased $8.9 billion to a net loss of $13.0 billion primarily driven by higher litigation expense as a result of both the DoJ Settlement and the settlement with FHFA as well as the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above. Mortgage banking income decreased $2.2 billion driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above. The provision for credit losses decreased $27 million to $291 million driven by the continued improvement in portfolio trends including increased home prices, partially offset by additional costs associated with the consumer relief portion of the DoJ Settlement. Noninterest expense increased $9.1 billion primarily due to a $12.4 billion increase in litigation expense as a result of the DoJ Settlement and the settlement with FHFA. Excluding litigation, noninterest expense decreased $3.2 billion to $6.3 billion driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above. Home Loans Home Loans products are available to our customers through our retail network, direct telephone and online access delivered by a sales force of approximately 2,600 mortgage loan officers, including nearly 1,500 banking center mortgage loan officers covering nearly 2,800 banking centers, and a nearly 700-person centralized sales force based in five call centers. Three Months Ended September 30, 2014 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2013 The net loss for Home Loans decreased $31 million to a net loss of $71 million driven by lower noninterest expense, partially offset by a decrease in noninterest income and higher provision for credit losses. Noninterest income decreased $176 million due to lower mortgage banking income driven by a decline in core production revenue as a result of lower origination volumes. The provision for credit losses increased $29 million due to a slower pace of credit quality improvement. Noninterest expense decreased $256 million primarily due to lower personnel expense resulting from lower loan originations. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2013 The net loss for Home Loans increased $253 million to a net loss of $271 million driven by lower noninterest income, partially offset by lower noninterest expense and lower provision for credit losses. Noninterest income decreased $1.0 billion due to the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above and continued industry-wide margin compression. The provision for credit losses decreased $95 million reflecting continued improvement in portfolio trends including increased home prices. Noninterest expense decreased $564 million driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above. Legacy Assets & Servicing Legacy Assets & Servicing is responsible for all of our in-house servicing activities related to the residential mortgage and home equity loan portfolios, including owned loans and loans serviced for others (collectively, the mortgage serviced portfolio). A portion of this portfolio has been designated as the Legacy Serviced Portfolio, which represented 27 percent and 33 percent of the total mortgage serviced portfolio, as measured by unpaid principal balance, at September 30, 2014 and 2013 . In addition, Legacy Assets & Servicing is responsible for managing subservicing arrangements. 37 Table of Contents Legacy Assets & Servicing results reflect the net cost of legacy exposures that are included in the results of CRES , including representations and warranties provision, litigation expense, financial results of the CRES home equity portfolio selected as part of the Legacy Owned Portfolio, the financial results of the servicing operations and the results of MSR activities, including net hedge results. The financial results of the servicing operations reflect certain revenues and expenses on loans serviced for others, including owned loans serviced for Home Loans, GWIM and All Other . Servicing activities include collecting cash for principal, interest and escrow payments from borrowers, disbursing customer draws for lines of credit, accounting for and remitting principal and interest payments to investors and escrow payments to third parties, and responding to customer inquiries. Our home retention efforts, including single point of contact resources, are also part of our servicing activities, along with supervision of foreclosures and property dispositions. In an effort to help our customers avoid foreclosure, Legacy Assets & Servicing evaluates various workout options prior to foreclosure which, combined with legislative changes at the state level and ongoing foreclosure delays in states where foreclosure requires a court order following a legal proceeding (judicial states), have resulted in elongated default timelines. For more information on our servicing activities, including the impact of foreclosure delays, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Servicing, Foreclosure and Other Mortgage Matters on page 57 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Three Months Ended September 30, 2014 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2013 The net loss for Legacy Assets & Servicing increased $4.2 billion to a net loss of $5.1 billion driven by higher litigation expense, which is included in noninterest expense, related to the DoJ Settlement and a lower tax benefit rate resulting from the non-deductible treatment of a portion of the DoJ Settlement, higher provision for credit losses and lower mortgage banking income. Mortgage banking income decreased $278 million driven by a decline in servicing income due to a smaller servicing portfolio combined with less favorable MSR, net-of-hedge performance, partially offset by lower representations and warranties provision. The provision for credit losses increased $565 million due to $400 million of additional costs associated with the consumer relief portion of the DoJ Settlement and a slower pace of credit quality improvement. Noninterest expense increased $4.1 billion due to a $5.0 billion increase in litigation expense as discussed in CRES results above, partially offset by a decrease in default-related servicing expenses and lower mortgage-related assessments, waivers and similar costs related to foreclosure delays. Excluding litigation, noninterest expense decreased $839 million to $1.3 billion. We expect that noninterest expense in Legacy Assets & Servicing, excluding litigation expense, will decline to $1.1 billion for the first quarter of 2015. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2013 The net loss for Legacy Assets & Servicing increased $8.7 billion to a net loss of $12.7 billion driven by an increase in noninterest expense, a lower tax benefit rate resulting from the non-deductible treatment of a portion of the DoJ Settlement, lower mortgage banking income and higher provision for credit losses. Mortgage banking income decreased $1.2 billion due to the same factors as described in three-month discussion above. The provision for credit losses increased $68 million due to the DoJ Settlement as described in the three-month discussion above, partially offset by continued improvement in portfolio trends including increased home prices. Noninterest expense increased $9.7 billion due to higher litigation expense as a result of the DoJ Settlement and the settlement with FHFA, partially offset by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above. Excluding litigation, noninterest expense decreased $2.7 billion to $4.3 billion. Legacy Portfolios The Legacy Portfolios (both owned and serviced) include those loans originated prior to January 1, 2011 that would not have been originated under our established underwriting standards in place as of December 31, 2010. The purchased credit-impaired (PCI) portfolio, as well as certain loans that met a pre-defined delinquency status or probability of default threshold as of January 1, 2011, are also included in the Legacy Portfolios. Since determining the pool of loans to be included in the Legacy Portfolios as of January 1, 2011, the criteria have not changed for these portfolios, but will continue to be evaluated over time. Legacy Owned Portfolio The Legacy Owned Portfolio includes those loans that met the criteria as described above and are on the balance sheet of the Corporation. The home equity loan portfolio is held on the balance sheet of Legacy Assets & Servicing, and the residential mortgage loan portfolio is held on the balance sheet of All Other . The financial results of the on-balance sheet loans are reported in the segment that owns the loans or in All Other . Total loans in the Legacy Owned Portfolio decreased $17.1 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to $95.0 billion , of which $34.5 billion were held on the Legacy Assets & Servicing balance sheet and the remainder was held on the balance sheet of All Other . The decrease was primarily related to paydowns, loan sales, PCI write-offs and charge-offs. 38 Table of Contents Legacy Serviced Portfolio The Legacy Serviced Portfolio includes loans serviced by Legacy Assets & Servicing in both the Legacy Owned Portfolio and those loans serviced for outside investors that met the criteria as described above. The table below summarizes the balances of the residential mortgage loans included in the Legacy Serviced Portfolio (the Legacy Residential Mortgage Serviced Portfolio) representing 25 percent and 32 percent of the total residential mortgage serviced portfolio of $636.0 billion and $795.0 billion , as measured by unpaid principal balance, at September 30, 2014 and 2013 . The decline in the Legacy Residential Mortgage Serviced Portfolio was primarily due to MSR sales, loan sales and other servicing transfers, paydowns and payoffs.

(2) Excludes $36 billion and $41 billion of home equity loans and HELOCs at September 30, 2014 and 2013 . Non-Legacy Portfolio As previously discussed, Legacy Assets & Servicing is responsible for all of our servicing activities. The table below summarizes the balances of the residential mortgage loans that are not included in the Legacy Serviced Portfolio (the Non-Legacy Residential Mortgage Serviced Portfolio) representing 75 percent and 68 percent of the total residential mortgage serviced portfolio, as measured by unpaid principal balance, at September 30, 2014 and 2013 . The decline in the Non-Legacy Residential Mortgage Serviced Portfolio was primarily due to MSR sales and other servicing transfers, paydowns and payoffs. Non-Legacy Residential Mortgage Serviced Portfolio, a subset of the Residential Mortgage Serviced Portfolio (1, 2) September 30 (Dollars in billions) 2014 2013 Unpaid principal balance Residential mortgage loans Total $ 476 $ 544 60 days or more past due 10 13 Number of loans serviced (in thousands) Residential mortgage loans Total 3,035 3,450 60 days or more past due 58 71 (1) Excludes loans for which servicing transferred to third parties as of September 30, 2014 with an effective MSR sale date of October 1, 2014, totaling $439 million . (2) Excludes $50 billion and $53 billion of home equity loans and HELOCs at September 30, 2014 and 2013 . 39 Table of Contents Mortgage Banking Income CRES mortgage banking income is categorized into production and servicing income. Core production income is comprised primarily of revenue from the fair value gains and losses recognized on our interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and LHFS, the related secondary market execution, costs related to representations and warranties in the sales transactions along with other obligations incurred in the sales of mortgage loans, and revenue earned in production-related ancillary businesses. Ongoing costs related to representations and warranties and other obligations that were incurred in the sales of mortgage loans in prior periods are also included in production income. Servicing income includes income earned in connection with servicing activities and MSR valuation adjustments, net of results from risk management activities used to hedge certain market risks of the MSRs. The costs associated with our servicing activities are included in noninterest expense. The table below summarizes the components of mortgage banking income. Mortgage Banking Income Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 (Dollars in millions) 2014 2013 2014 2013 Production income: Core production revenue $ 293 $ 465 $ 884 $ 2,140 Representations and warranties provision (167 ) (323 ) (432 ) (770 ) Total production income 126 142 452 1,370 Servicing income: Servicing fees 452 700 1,441 2,400 Amortization of expected cash flows (1) (201 ) (240 ) (620 ) (814 ) Fair value changes of MSRs, net of risk management activities used to hedge certain market risks (2) (19 ) 167 152 693 Other servicing-related revenue 6 7 23 Total net servicing income 232 633 980 2,302 Total CRES mortgage banking income 358 775 1,432 3,672 Eliminations (3) (86 ) (190 ) (221 ) (646 ) Total consolidated mortgage banking income $ 272 $ 585 $ 1,211 $ 3,026 (1) Represents the net change in fair value of the MSR asset due to the recognition of modeled cash flows. (2) Includes gains (losses) on sales of MSRs. (3) Includes the effect of transfers of mortgage loans from CRES to the ALM portfolio included in All Other . Three Months Ended September 30, 2014 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2013 Core production revenue decreased $172 million due to lower origination volumes as described below. The representations and warranties provision decreased $156 million to $167 million . The provision was primarily related to non-government-sponsored enterprises exposures, partially offset by lower exposure to mortgage insurance rescissions due to settlements with certain mortgage insurance companies in 2014. Net servicing income decreased $401 million driven by lower servicing fees due to a smaller servicing portfolio and less favorable MSR net-of-hedge performance, partially offset by lower amortization of expected cash flows. The decline in the size of our servicing portfolio was driven by strategic sales of MSRs during 2014 and 2013 as well as loan prepayment activity, which exceeded new originations primarily due to our exit from non-retail channels. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2013 Core production revenue decreased $1.3 billion due to the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above, combined with industry-wide margin compression. The representations and warranties provision decreased $338 million to $432 million . The provision was related to the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above. Net servicing income decreased $1.3 billion driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above. 40 Table of Contents Key Statistics Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 (Dollars in millions, except as noted) 2014 2013 2014 2013 Loan production (1) Total (2) : First mortgage $ 11,725 $ 22,601 $ 31,674 $ 71,797 Home equity 3,224 1,831 7,812 4,446 CRES: First mortgage $ 8,861 $ 17,833 $ 24,024 $ 57,611 Home equity 2,970 1,599 7,157 3,824 Period end September 30 2014 December 31 2013 Mortgage serviced portfolio (in billions) (1, 3) $ 722 $ 810 Mortgage loans serviced for investors (in billions) (1) 491 550 Mortgage servicing rights: Balance (4) 3,986 5,042 Capitalized mortgage servicing rights (% of loans serviced for investors) 81 bps 92 bps (1) The above loan production and period-end servicing portfolio and mortgage loans serviced for investors represent the unpaid principal balance of loans.

(3) Servicing of residential mortgage loans, HELOCs and home equity loans by Legacy Assets & Servicing. (4) At September 30, 2014 , excludes $257 million of certain non-U.S. residential mortgage MSR balances that are recorded in Global Markets . First mortgage loan originations in CRES and for the total Corporation declined for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in 2013 reflecting a decline in the overall mortgage market as higher interest rates drove a decrease in refinances. The increase in interest rates also had an adverse impact on our mortgage loan applications, particularly for refinance mortgage loans compared to the same periods in 2013 . During the three months ended September 30, 2014 , 57 percent of our first mortgage production volume was for refinance originations and 43 percent was for purchase originations compared to 78 percent and 22 percent for the same period in 2013 . Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP) refinance originations were five percent of all refinance originations compared to 17 percent for the same period in 2013 . Making Home Affordable non-HARP refinance originations were 15 percent of all refinance originations compared to 17 percent for the same period in 2013 . The remaining 80 percent of refinance originations was conventional refinances compared to 66 percent for the same period in 2013 . During the nine months ended September 30, 2014 , 58 percent of our first mortgage production volume was for refinance originations and 42 percent was for purchase originations compared to 84 percent and 16 percent for the same period in 2013 . HARP refinance originations were seven percent of all refinance originations compared to 24 percent for the same period in 2013 . Making Home Affordable non-HARP refinance originations were 18 percent of all refinance originations compared to 19 percent for the same period in 2013 . The remaining 75 percent of refinance originations was conventional refinances compared to 57 percent for the same period in 2013 . Home equity production for the total Corporation was $3.2 billion and $7.8 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $1.8 billion and $4.4 billion for the same periods in 2013 , with the increase due to a higher demand in the market based on improving housing trends, and increased market share driven by improved banking center engagement with customers and more competitive pricing. Mortgage Servicing Rights At September 30, 2014 , the balance of consumer MSRs managed within CRES , which excludes $257 million of certain non-U.S. residential mortgage MSRs recorded in Global Markets , was $4.0 billion , which represented 81 bps of the related unpaid principal balance compared to $5.0 billion , or 92 bps of the related unpaid principal balance at December 31, 2013 . The consumer MSR balance managed within CRES decreased $1.1 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 primarily driven by a decrease in value due to lower mortgage rates compared to December 31, 2013 , which resulted in higher forecasted prepayment speeds, and the recognition of modeled cash flows, partially offset by additions to the portfolio.

Global Corporate and Global Commercial Banking revenue increased $192 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 due to higher revenue in Global Transaction Services. Business Lending revenue in Global Corporate Banking and Global Commercial Banking declined $13 million and $28 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 primarily due to lower net interest margin and credit service charges. Business Lending revenue in Global Corporate Banking and Global Commercial Banking remained relatively unchanged for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 . 46 Table of Contents Global Transaction Services revenue in Global Corporate Banking increased $65 million and $199 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in 2013 driven by the impact of growth in U.S. and non-U.S. deposit balances. Global Transaction Services revenue in Global Commercial Banking remained relatively unchanged for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in 2013 . Average loans and leases in Global Corporate and Global Commercial Banking increased three percent and seven percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in 2013 primarily driven by growth in the commercial and industrial and commercial real estate portfolios. Average deposits in Global Corporate and Global Commercial Banking increased 11 percent and 14 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in 2013 due to client liquidity and international growth. Investment Banking Client teams and product specialists underwrite and distribute debt, equity and loan products, and provide advisory services and tailored risk management solutions. The economics of most investment banking and underwriting activities are shared primarily between Global Banking and Global Markets based on the activities performed by each segment.

Total Corporation investment banking fees of $4.5 billion , excluding self-led deals, included within Global Banking and Global Markets , increased three percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 as strong equity underwriting, investment-grade underwriting and advisory fees were partially offset by lower underwriting fees for other debt products. 47 Table of Contents Global Markets Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 (Dollars in millions) 2014 2013 % Change 2014 2013 % Change Net interest income (FTE basis) $ 988 $ 969 2 % $ 2,937 $ 3,086 (5 )% Noninterest income: Investment and brokerage services 522 480 9 1,623 1,557 4 Investment banking fees 577 622 (7 ) 2,073 1,969 5 Trading account profits 1,786 1,201 49 5,921 5,939 All other income (loss) 263 (53 ) n/m 1,177 (359 ) n/m Total noninterest income 3,148 2,250 40 10,794 9,106 19 Total revenue, net of interest expense (FTE basis) 4,136 3,219 28 13,731 12,192 13 Provision for credit losses 45 47 (4 ) 83 36 131 Noninterest expense 3,336 2,881 16 9,275 8,724 6 Income before income taxes 755 291 159 4,373 3,432 27 Income tax expense (FTE basis) 386 1,166 (67 ) 1,595 2,233 (29 ) Net income (loss) $ 369 $ (875 ) (142 ) $ 2,778 $ 1,199 132 Return on average allocated capital 4.33 % n/m 10.95 % 5.37 % Efficiency ratio (FTE basis) 80.65 89.52 % 67.55 71.56 Balance Sheet Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 Average 2014 2013 % Change 2014 2013 % Change Total trading-related assets (1) $ 446,490 $ 442,597 1 % $ 447,886 $ 479,052 (7 )% Total loans and leases 62,939 64,491 (2 ) 63,402 57,886 10 Total earning assets (1) 457,815 458,626 464,298 489,007 (5 ) Total assets 599,893 602,565 606,140 642,674 (6 ) Allocated capital 34,000 30,000 13 34,000 30,000 13 Period end September 30 2014 December 31 2013 % Change Total trading-related assets (1) $ 433,597 $ 411,080 5 % Total loans and leases 62,645 67,381 (7 ) Total earning assets (1) 443,364 432,807 2 Total assets 598,668 575,482 4 (1) Trading-related assets include derivative assets, which are considered non-earning assets. n/m = not meaningful Global Markets offers sales and trading services, including research, to institutional clients across fixed-income, credit, currency, commodity and equity businesses. Global Markets product coverage includes securities and derivative products in both the primary and secondary markets. Global Markets provides market-making, financing, securities clearing, settlement and custody services globally to our institutional investor clients in support of their investing and trading activities. We also work with our commercial and corporate clients to provide risk management products using interest rate, equity, credit, currency and commodity derivatives, foreign exchange, fixed-income and mortgage-related products. As a result of our market-making activities in these products, we may be required to manage risk in a broad range of financial products including government securities, equity and equity-linked securities, high-grade and high-yield corporate debt securities, syndicated loans, mortgage-backed securities (MBS), commodities and asset-backed securities (ABS). In addition, the economics of most investment banking and underwriting activities are shared primarily between Global Markets and Global Banking based on the activities performed by each segment . Global Banking originates certain deal-related transactions with our corporate and commercial clients that are executed and distributed by Global Markets. For more information on investment banking fees on a consolidated basis, see page 47 . 48 Table of Contents Three Months Ended September 30, 2014 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2013 Net income for Global Markets increased $1.2 billion to $369 million . Excluding net DVA and charges in 2013 related to the U.K. corporate income tax rate reduction, net income decreased $290 million to $241 million primarily driven by increased litigation expense and lower investment banking fees, partially offset by improved trading performance. Net DVA gains were $205 million compared to losses of $444 million . Noninterest expense increased $455 million to $3.3 billion due to higher litigation expense and revenue-related incentives. The increase in litigation expense was primarily due to the non-deductible charge related to the FX Matters as discussed in Recent Events on page 5 . The U.K. corporate income tax rate reduction enacted in the third quarter of 2013 resulted in a $1.1 billion charge to income tax expense for the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets. Average earning assets remained relatively unchanged. The return on average allocated capital was 4.33 percent . Excluding net DVA and charges in 2013 related to the U.K. corporate income tax rate reduction, the return on average allocated capital was 2.84 percent compared to 7.04 percent in the prior-year period, reflecting lower net income and an increase in allocated capital. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 28 . Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2013 Net income for Global Markets increased $1.6 billion to $2.8 billion . Excluding net DVA and charges in 2013 related to the U.K. corporate income tax rate reduction, net income decreased $128 million to $2.5 billion primarily driven by higher litigation expense, partially offset by a $240 million gain related to the initial public offering of an equity investment and higher investment banking income. The first quarter of 2013 also included a write-down of a monoline receivable due to the settlement of a legacy matter. Net DVA gains were $386 million compared to losses of $540 million . Noninterest expense increased $551 million to $9.3 billion due to higher litigation expense and technology costs and investment in infrastructure. Average earning assets decreased $24.7 billion to $464.3 billion largely driven by a decrease in trading assets to further optimize the balance sheet for liquidity purposes. For additional information, see Executive Summary Balance Sheet Overview on page 11 . The return on average allocated capital was 10.95 percent , up from 5.37 percent , largely driven by increased net income, partially offset by an increase in allocated capital. Excluding net DVA and charges in 2013 related to the U.K. corporate income tax rate reduction, the return on average allocated capital was 10.00 percent, a decrease from 11.90 percent, driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above. 49 Table of Contents Sales and Trading Revenue Sales and trading revenue includes unrealized and realized gains and losses on trading and other assets, net interest income, and fees primarily from commissions on equity securities. Sales and trading revenue is segregated into fixed-income (government debt obligations, investment and non-investment grade corporate debt obligations, commercial mortgage-backed securities, RMBS, collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), interest rate and credit derivative contracts), currencies (interest rate and foreign exchange contracts), commodities (primarily futures, forwards, swaps and options) and equities (equity-linked derivatives and cash equity activity). The table below and related discussion present sales and trading revenue, substantially all of which is in Global Markets, with the remainder in Global Banking . In addition, the table below and related discussion present sales and trading revenue excluding the impact of net DVA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe the use of this non-GAAP financial measure provides clarity in assessing the underlying performance of these businesses. Sales and Trading Revenue (1, 2) Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 (Dollars in millions) 2014 2013 2014 2013 Sales and trading revenue Fixed income, currencies and commodities $ 2,381 $ 1,636 $ 7,833 $ 6,704 Equities 1,097 918 3,327 3,351 Total sales and trading revenue $ 3,478 $ 2,554 $ 11,160 $ 10,055 Sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA (3) Fixed income, currencies and commodities $ 2,247 $ 2,029 $ 7,563 $ 7,283 Equities 1,026 969 3,211 3,312 Total sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA $ 3,273 $ 2,998 $ 10,774 $ 10,595 (1) Includes FTE adjustments of $38 million and $127 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $43 million and $137 million for the same periods in 2013 . For more information on sales and trading revenue, see Note 2 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . (2) Includes Global Banking sales and trading revenue of $67 million and $219 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $108 million and $319 million for the same periods in 2013 . (3) FICC and Equities sales and trading revenue, excluding the impact of net DVA, is a non-GAAP financial measure. FICC net DVA gains were $134 million and $270 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to net DVA losses of $393 million and $579 million for the same periods in 2013. Equities net DVA gains were $71 million and $116 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to net DVA losses of $51 million and gains of $39 million for the same periods in 2013. Three Months Ended September 30, 2014 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2013 Fixed-income, currency and commodities (FICC) revenue, excluding net DVA, increased $218 million to $2.2 billion primarily due to strong results in currencies due to increased volatility as well as gains in mortgages and commodities, partially offset by declines in rates as a result of continued low volatility and lower client activity in that market. Equities revenue, excluding net DVA, increased $57 million to $1.0 billion due to increased client financing revenue. Sales and trading revenue included total commissions and brokerage fee revenue of $522 million , substantially all from equities, which remained relatively unchanged. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2013 FICC revenue, excluding net DVA, increased $280 million to $7.6 billion driven by improvement in the credit-related businesses as well as a $450 million write-down of a monoline receivable in the prior-year period related to the settlement of a legacy matter, partially offset by the cost of financing additional liquid assets. Equities revenue, excluding net DVA, decreased $101 million to $3.2 billion also due to financing additional liquid assets. 50 Table of Contents All Other Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 (Dollars in millions) 2014 2013 % Change 2014 2013 % Change Net interest income (FTE basis) $ 76 $ 42 81 % $ (152 ) $ 569 n/m Noninterest income: Card income 93 79 18 267 245 9 % Equity investment income (loss) (51 ) 1,122 n/m 679 2,217 (69 ) Gains on sales of debt securities 410 347 18 1,149 866 33 All other loss (593 ) (565 ) 5 (1,851 ) (1,847 ) Total noninterest income (141 ) 983 n/m 244 1,481 (84 ) Total revenue, net of interest expense (FTE basis) (65 ) 1,025 n/m 92 2,050 (96 ) Provision for credit losses (265 ) (549 ) (52 ) (646 ) (478 ) 35 Noninterest expense 245 968 (75 ) 2,405 3,357 (28 ) Income (loss) before income taxes (45 ) 606 n/m (1,667 ) (829 ) 101 Income tax benefit (FTE basis) (545 ) (112 ) n/m (2,078 ) (1,125 ) 85 Net income $ 500 $ 718 (30 ) $ 411 $ 296 39 Balance Sheet Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 Average 2014 2013 % Change 2014 2013 % Change Loans and leases: Residential mortgage $ 177,184 $ 206,409 (14 )% $ 186,280 $ 210,882 (12 )% Non-U.S. credit card 11,784 10,633 11 11,700 10,757 9 Other 10,435 15,483 (33 ) 11,077 16,999 (35 ) Total loans and leases 199,403 232,525 (14 ) 209,057 238,638 (12 ) Total assets (1) 157,665 203,735 (23 ) 166,318 228,217 (27 ) Total deposits 29,268 35,419 (17 ) 33,147 35,063 (5 ) Period end September 30 2014 December 31 2013 % Change Loans and leases: Residential mortgage $ 167,258 $ 197,061 (15 )% Non-U.S. credit card 11,433 11,541 (1 ) Other 9,665 12,088 (20 ) Total loans and leases 188,356 220,690 (15 ) Total assets (1) 154,280 167,554 (8 ) Total deposits 25,109 27,851 (10 ) (1) In segments where the total of liabilities and equity exceeds assets, which are generally deposit-taking segments, we allocate assets from All Other to those segments to match liabilities (i.e., deposits) and allocated shareholders' equity. Such allocated assets were $601.9 billion and $593.5 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $540.4 billion and $530.4 billion for the same periods in 2013 , and $592.0 billion and $569.9 billion at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . n/m = not meaningful All Other consists of ALM activities, equity investments, the international consumer card business, liquidating businesses, residual expense allocations and other. ALM activities encompass the whole-loan residential mortgage portfolio and investment securities, interest rate and foreign currency risk management activities including the residual net interest income allocation, the impact of certain allocation methodologies and accounting hedge ineffectiveness. The results of certain ALM activities are allocated to our business segments . For more information on our ALM activities, see Interest Rate Risk Management for Non-trading Activities on page 128 . Equity investments include GPI which is comprised of a portfolio of equity, real estate and other alternative investments. These investments are made either directly in a company or held through a fund with related income recorded in equity investment income. In connection with our strategy to focus on our core businesses and to conform with the Volcker Rule, the GPI portfolio has been actively winding down over the last 51 Table of Contents several years through a series of portfolio and individual asset sale transactions. Additionally, certain residential mortgage loans that are managed by Legacy Assets & Servicing are held in All Other . Three Months Ended September 30, 2014 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2013 Net income for All Other decreased $218 million to $500 million primarily due to a decrease of $1.2 billion in equity investment income, an increase of $232 million in U.K. PPI costs and a $284 million reduction in the benefit in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by a decrease of $723 million in noninterest expense and an increase of $433 million in the income tax benefit. The benefit in the provision for credit losses declined $284 million to a benefit of $265 million driven by a slower pace of credit quality improvement related to the residential mortgage portfolio. Noninterest expense decreased $723 million to $245 million primarily due to a decline in litigation expense and lower personnel expense. The income tax benefit was $545 million compared to a benefit of $112 million , with the increase driven by the release of tax reserves attributable to the resolution of certain examinations, and the change in pretax earnings. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2013 Net income for All Other increased $115 million to $411 million primarily due an increase of $283 million in gains on sales of debt securities, a $168 million improvement in the provision for credit losses, a decrease of $952 million in noninterest expense and an increase of $953 million in the income tax benefit, partially offset by a decrease of $1.5 billion in equity investment income and the negative impact of market-related premium amortization expense on debt securities. The provision for credit losses improved $168 million to a benefit of $646 million primarily driven by the impact of net recoveries on loan sales, partially offset by a slower pace of credit quality improvement related to the residential mortgage portfolio. Noninterest expense decreased $952 million to $2.4 billion primarily driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above. The income tax benefit was $2.1 billion compared to a benefit of $1.1 billion , with the increase driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above. 52 Table of Contents Equity Investment Activity The tables below present the components of equity investments included in All Other at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 , and also a reconciliation to the total consolidated equity investment income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013 .

GPI had unfunded equity commitments of $39 million at September 30, 2014 compared to $127 million at December 31, 2013 . Equity investment results included in All Other were a loss of $51 million and gain of $679 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 , a decrease of $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion compared to the same periods in 2013 . The decrease s for the three- and nine-month periods were due to a $753 million gain on the sale of our remaining investment in CCB and a gain on the sale of a portion of an equity investment in the prior-year periods. Total Corporation equity investment income was $9 million and $1.2 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 , a decrease of $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion from the same periods in 2013 , due to the same factors as described above, partially offset by a gain in 2014 related to the initial public offering of an equity investment in Global Markets . 53 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have contractual obligations to make future payments on debt and lease agreements. Additionally, in the normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements whereby we commit to future purchases of products or services from unaffiliated parties. For more information on obligations and commitments, see Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements , Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations on page 52 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K , as well as Note 11 Long-term Debt and Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Representations and Warranties We securitize first-lien residential mortgage loans generally in the form of RMBS guaranteed by the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) or by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) in the case of Federal Housing Administration (FHA)-insured, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)-guaranteed and Rural Housing Service-guaranteed mortgage loans. In addition, in prior years, legacy companies and certain subsidiaries sold pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans and home equity loans as private-label securitizations (in certain of these securitizations, monolines or financial guarantee providers insured all or some of the securities) or in the form of whole loans. In connection with these transactions, we or certain of our subsidiaries or legacy companies make or have made various representations and warranties. Breaches of these representations and warranties have resulted in and may continue to result in the requirement to repurchase mortgage loans or to otherwise make whole or provide other remedies to the GSEs, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development with respect to FHA-insured loans, VA, whole-loan investors, securitization trusts, monoline insurers or other financial guarantors (collectively, repurchases). In all such cases, we would be exposed to any credit loss on the repurchased mortgage loans after accounting for any mortgage insurance (MI) or mortgage guarantee payments that we may receive. For more information on accounting for representations and warranties and our representations and warranties repurchase claims and exposures, see Note 7 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees and Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation's 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K . We have vigorously contested any request for repurchase when we conclude that a valid basis for repurchase does not exist and will continue to do so in the future. However, in an effort to resolve these legacy mortgage-related issues, we have reached bulk settlements, certain of which have been for significant amounts in lieu of a loan-by-loan review process, including with the GSEs, with four monoline insurers and with the Bank of New York Mellon (BNY Mellon), as trustee (the Trustee) for certain trusts. As a result of various settlements with the GSEs, we have resolved substantially all outstanding and potential representations and warranties repurchase claims on whole loans sold by legacy Bank of America and Countrywide Financial Corporation (Countrywide) to Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) through June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2009, respectively. We may reach other settlements in the future if opportunities arise on terms we believe to be advantageous. However, there can be no assurance that we will reach future settlements or, if we do, that the terms of past settlements can be relied upon to predict the terms of future settlements. These bulk settlements generally did not cover all transactions with the relevant counterparties or all potential claims that may arise, including in some instances securities law, fraud and servicing claims. Our liability in connection with the transactions and claims not covered by these settlements could be material to the Corporation's results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period. BNY Mellon Settlement The settlement with Bank of New York Mellon (BNY Mellon Settlement) remains subject to final court approval and certain other conditions. It is not currently possible to predict the ultimate outcome or timing of the court approval process, which includes appeals and could take a substantial period of time. On January 31, 2014, the court issued a decision, order and judgment approving the BNY Mellon Settlement. The court overruled the objections to the settlement, holding that the Trustee, BNY Mellon, acted in good faith, within its discretion and within the bounds of reasonableness in determining that the settlement agreement was in the best interests of the covered trusts. The court declined to approve the Trustee's conduct only with respect to the Trustee's consideration of a potential claim that a loan must be repurchased if the servicer modifies its terms. On February 21, 2014, final judgment was entered and the Trustee filed a notice of appeal regarding the court's ruling on loan modification claims in the settlement. Certain objectors to the settlement have filed cross-appeals appealing the court's approval of the settlement, some of whom have subsequently withdrawn their objections. All appeals were fully briefed by September 22, 2014, and oral argument occurred on October 23, 2014. The court's January 31, 2014 decision, order and judgment remain subject to these appeals, as well as a motion to reargue to be heard on February 26, 2015, and it is not possible at this time to predict when the court approval process will be completed. 54 Table of Contents Although we are not a party to the proceeding, certain of our rights and obligations under the settlement agreement are conditioned on final court approval of the settlement. There can be no assurance final court approval will be obtained, that all conditions to the BNY Mellon Settlement will be satisfied, or if certain conditions to the BNY Mellon Settlement permitting withdrawal are met, that we and Countrywide will not withdraw from the settlement. If final court approval is not obtained, or if we and Countrywide withdraw from the BNY Mellon Settlement in accordance with its terms, our future representations and warranties losses could be substantially different from existing accruals and the estimated range of possible loss over existing accruals. For a summary of the larger settlement actions and the related impact on the representations and warranties provision and liability, see Note 7 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Unresolved Repurchase Claims Repurchase claims received from a counterparty are considered unresolved repurchase claims until the underlying loan is repurchased, the claim is rescinded by the counterparty or the representations and warranties claims with respect to the applicable trust are settled, and fully and finally released. Unresolved repurchase claims represent the notional amount of repurchase claims made by counterparties, typically the outstanding principal balance or the unpaid principal balance at the time of default . In the case of first-lien mortgages, the claim amount is often significantly greater than the expected loss amount due to the benefit of collateral and, in some cases , MI or mortgage guarantee payments. When a claim is denied and we do not receive a response from the counterparty, the claim remains in the unresolved repurchase claims balance until resolution . Table 16 presents unresolved repurchase claims by counterparty at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . Table 16 Unresolved Repurchase Claims by Counterparty (Dollars in millions) September 30 2014 December 31 2013 Private-label securitization trustees, whole-loan investors, including third-party securitization sponsors and other (1, 2, 3) $ 23,012 $ 17,953 Monolines (4) 1,087 1,532 GSEs 70 170 Total unresolved repurchase claims $ 24,169 $ 19,655 (1) At both September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 , unresolved repurchase claims did not include repurchase demands of $1.2 billion where the Corporation believes that these demands are procedurally or substantively invalid. (2) The total notional amount of unresolved repurchase claims does not include repurchase claims related to the trusts covered by the BNY Mellon Settlement. (3) Includes $14.0 billion and $13.8 billion of claims based on individual file reviews and $9.0 billion and $4.1 billion of claims submitted without individual file reviews at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . (4) At September 30, 2014 , substantially all of the unresolved monoline claims pertain to second-lien loans and are currently the subject of litigation with a single monoline insurer. During the three months ended September 30, 2014 , we received $2.4 billion in new repurchase claims, including $2.1 billion of claims submitted without individual loan file reviews and $249 million of claims based on individual loan file reviews submitted by private-label securitization trustees , $60 million submitted by the GSEs for both Countrywide and legacy Bank of America originations not covered by the bulk settlements with the GSEs, and $19 million submitted by whole-loan investors . During the three months ended September 30, 2014 , $135 million in claims were resolved. Of the claims resolved, $47 million were resolved through rescissions and $88 million were resolved through mortgage repurchases and make-whole payments with GSEs, private-label securitization trustees and whole-loan investors . During the nine months ended September 30, 2014 , we received $6.1 billion in new repurchase claims, including $4.9 billion of claims submitted without individual loan file reviews and $698 million of claims based on individual loan file reviews submitted by private-label securitization trustees and a financial guarantee provider , $301 million submitted by the GSEs for both Countrywide and legacy Bank of America originations not covered by the bulk settlements with the GSEs, and $217 million submitted by whole-loan investors . During the nine months ended September 30, 2014 , $1.8 billion in claims were resolved. Of the claims resolved, $856 million were resolved through settlement , $464 million were resolved through rescissions and $505 million were resolved through mortgage repurchases and make-whole payments with GSEs, private-label securitization trustees and whole-loan investors . 55 Table of Contents The increase in the notional amount of unresolved repurchase claims during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 is primarily due to: (1) continued submission of claims by private-label securitization trustees, (2) the level of detail, support and analysis accompanying such claims, which impact overall claim quality and, therefore, claims resolution, and (3) the lack of an established process to resolve disputes related to these claims . For example, claims submitted without individual file reviews generally lack the level of detail and analysis of individual loans found in other claims that is necessary to support a claim . We expect unresolved repurchase claims related to private-label securitizations to increase as such claims continue to be submitted and there is not an established process for the ultimate resolution of such claims on which there is a disagreement. In addition to, and not included in, the total unresolved repurchase claims of $24.2 billion at September 30, 2014 are repurchase demands we have received from private-label securitization investors and a master servicer where we believe that these demands are procedurally or substantively invalid. The total amount outstanding of such demands was $1.2 billion at both September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 , comprised of $935 million of demands received during 2012 and $272 million of demands related to trusts covered by the BNY Mellon Settlement . We do not believe that the aforementioned demands outstanding at September 30, 2014 are valid repurchase claims and, therefore, it is not possible to predict the resolution with respect to such demands. Legacy companies sold $184.5 billion of loans originated between 2004 and 2008 into monoline-insured securitizations. At September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 , for loans originated between 2004 and 2008 , the unpaid principal balance of loans related to unresolved monoline repurchase claims was $1.1 billion and $1.5 billion . Substantially all of the remaining unresolved monoline claims pertain to second-lien loans and are currently the subject of litigation with a single monoline insurer. There may be additional claims or file requests in the future. As a result of various settlements with the GSEs, we have resolved substantially all outstanding and potential representations and warranties repurchase claims on whole loans sold by legacy Bank of America and Countrywide to FNMA and FHLMC through June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2009, respectively. After these settlements, our exposure to representations and warranties liability for loans originated prior to 2009 and sold to the GSEs is limited to loans with an original principal balance of $14.0 billion and loans with certain defects excluded from the settlements that we do not believe will be material, such as certain specified violations of the GSEs' charters, including fraud and title defects. As of September 30, 2014 , of the $14.0 billion , approximately $11.4 billion in principal has been paid and $961 million in principal has defaulted or was severely delinquent. The notional amount of unresolved repurchase claims submitted by the GSEs was $60 million related to these vintages. Representations and Warranties Liability The liability for representations and warranties and corporate guarantees is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the related provision is included in mortgage banking income in the Consolidated Statement of Income . For more information on the representations and warranties liability and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Estimated Range of Possible Loss on page 59 . At September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 , the liability for representations and warranties was $11.9 billion and $13.3 billion . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 , the representations and warranties provision was $167 million and $432 million compared to $323 million and $770 million for the same periods in 2013 . Our estimated liability at September 30, 2014 for obligations under representations and warranties is necessarily dependent on, and limited by, a number of factors, including for private-label securitizations, the implied repurchase experience based on the BNY Mellon Settlement, as well as certain other assumptions and judgmental factors. Accordingly, future provisions associated with obligations under representations and warranties may be materially impacted if actual experiences are different from historical experience or our understandings, interpretations or assumptions. Although we have not recorded any representations and warranties liability for certain potential private-label securitization and whole-loan exposures where we have had little to no claim activity, or where the applicable statute of limitations has expired, these exposures are included in the estimated range of possible loss. 56 Table of Contents Experience with Investors Other than Government-sponsored Enterprises In prior years, legacy companies and certain subsidiaries sold pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans and home equity loans as private-label securitizations or in the form of whole loans originated from 2004 through 2008 with an original principal balance of $970 billion to investors other than GSEs (although the GSEs are investors in certain private-label securitizations), including $786 billion to private-label and whole-loan investors without monoline insurance and $ 184 billion with monoline insurance. Of the $970 billion , $571 billion in principal has been paid, $198 billion in principal has defaulted, $47 billion in principal was severely delinquent, and $154 billion in principal was current or less than 180 days past due at September 30, 2014 . Table 17 details the population of loans originated between 2004 and 2008 and sold in non-agency securitizations or as whole loans by entity and product together with the defaulted and severely delinquent loans stratified by the number of payments the borrower made prior to default or becoming severely delinquent as of September 30, 2014 .

(2) Includes exposures on third-party sponsored transactions related to legacy entity originations. As it relates to private-label securitizations, a contractual liability to repurchase mortgage loans generally arises only if counterparties prove there is a breach of representations and warranties that materially and adversely affects the interest of the investor or all the investors in a securitization trust or of the monoline insurer or other financial guarantor (as applicable). We believe many of the loan defaults observed in these securitizations and whole-loan balances were driven by external factors like the substantial depreciation in home prices, persistently high unemployment and other negative economic trends, diminishing the likelihood that any loan defect (assuming one exists at all) was the cause of a loan's default. As of September 30, 2014 , approximately 25 percent of the loans sold to non-GSEs that were originated between 2004 and 2008 have defaulted or are severely delinquent. Of the original principal balance for Countrywide, $409 billion is included in the BNY Mellon Settlement and, of this amount, $109 billion was defaulted or severely delinquent at September 30, 2014 . 57 Table of Contents Experience with Private-label Securitizations and Whole Loans Legacy entities, and to a lesser extent Bank of America, sold loans to investors via private-label securitizations or as whole loans. The majority of the loans sold were included in private-label securitizations, including third-party sponsored transactions. We provided representations and warranties to the whole-loan investors and these investors may retain those rights even when the whole loans were aggregated with other collateral into private-label securitizations sponsored by the whole-loan investors. The loans sold with an original total principal balance of $785.8 billion , without monoline insurance, included in Table 17 , were originated between 2004 and 2008 . Of the $785.8 billion , $466.6 billion have been paid in full and $192.5 billion were defaulted or severely delinquent at September 30, 2014 . At least 25 payments have been made on approximately 64 percent of the defaulted and severely delinquent loans. We have received approximately $31.8 billion of representations and warranties repurchase claims related to these vintages, including $22.6 billion from private-label securitization trustees and a financial guarantee provider, $8.4 billion from whole-loan investors and $816 million from one private-label securitization counterparty. In private-label securitizations, certain presentation thresholds need to be met in order for investors to direct a trustee to assert repurchase claims. Continued high levels of new private-label claims are primarily related to repurchase requests received from trustees and third-party sponsors for private-label securitization transactions not included in the BNY Mellon Settlement, including claims related to first-lien third-party sponsored securitizations that include monoline insurance. In addition, private-label securitization trustees may have obtained loan files through other means, including litigation and administrative subpoenas, which may increase our total exposure. A December 2013 decision by the New York intermediate appellate court held that, under New York law, which governs many RMBS trusts, the six-year statute of limitations starts to run at the time the representations and warranties are made, not the date when the repurchase demand was denied. That decision has been applied by the state and federal courts in several RMBS lawsuits not involving the Corporation, resulting in the dismissal as untimely of claims involving representations and warranties made more than six years prior to the initiation of the lawsuit. Unless overturned by New York's highest appellate court, which has taken the case for review, this decision would apply to claims and lawsuits brought against the Corporation where New York law governs. A significant amount of representations and warranties claims and/or lawsuits that we have received or may receive involve representations and warranties claims where the statute of limitations has expired under this ruling and has not been tolled by agreement, and which we therefore believe would be untimely. The Corporation believes this ruling may have had an influence on recent activity in requests for tolling agreements and the pace of lawsuits filed by private-label securitization trustees prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations . In addition, it is possible that in response to the statute of limitations rulings, parties seeking to pursue representations and warranties claims and/or lawsuits with respect to trusts where the statute of limitations for representations and warranties claims against the sponsor and/or issuer has run, may pursue alternate legal theories of recovery and/or assert claims against other contractual parties. For example, on June 18, 2014, a group of institutional investors filed six lawsuits against six trustees covering more than 2,200 RMBS trusts alleging failure to pursue representations and warranties claims and servicer defaults based upon alleged contractual, statutory and tort theories of liability. The Corporation and its affiliates have not been named as parties to these lawsuits. The impact on the Corporation, if any, of such alternative legal theories or assertions is unclear. We have resolved $8.9 billion of the $31.8 billion of claims received from whole-loan and private-label securitization counterparties with losses of $2.0 billion . The majority of these resolved claims were from third-party whole-loan investors. Approximately $3.6 billion of these claims were resolved through repurchase or indemnification, $5.0 billion were rescinded by the investor and $331 million were resolved through the settlement with FHFA. At September 30, 2014 , for loans originated between 2004 and 2008 , the notional amount of unresolved repurchase claims submitted by private-label securitization trustees, whole-loan investors, including third-party securitization sponsors, and others was $22.9 billion . We have performed an initial review with respect to substantially all of these claims and do not believe a valid basis for repurchase has been established by the claimant . Until we receive a repurchase claim, we generally do not review loan files related to private-label securitizations sponsored by third-party whole-loan investors and are not required by the governing documents to do so. Certain whole-loan investors have engaged with us in a consistent repurchase process and we have used that and other experience to record a liability related to existing and future claims from such counterparties. The BNY Mellon Settlement and subsequent activity with certain counterparties led to the determination that we had sufficient experience to record a liability related to our exposure on certain private-label securitizations, including certain private-label securitizations sponsored by third-party whole-loan investors, however, it did not provide sufficient experience to record a liability related to other private-label securitizations sponsored by third-party whole-loan investors. As it relates to the other private-label securitizations sponsored by third-party whole-loan investors and certain other whole-loan sales, as well as certain private-label securitizations impacted by recent court rulings on the statute of limitations, it is not possible to determine whether a loss has occurred or is probable and, therefore, no representations and warranties liability has been recorded in connection with these transactions. As discussed below, our estimated range of possible loss related to representations and warranties exposures as of September 30, 2014 included possible losses related to these whole-loan sales and private-label securitizations. 58 Table of Contents The representations and warranties, as governed by the private-label securitization agreements, generally require that counterparties have the ability to both assert a claim and to actually prove that a loan has an actionable defect under the applicable contracts. While the Corporation believes the agreements for private-label securitizations generally contain less rigorous representations and warranties and place higher burdens on claimants seeking repurchases than the express provisions of comparable agreements with the GSEs, without regard to any variations that may have arisen as a result of dealings with the GSEs, the agreements generally include a representation that underwriting practices were prudent and customary. In the case of private-label securitization trustees and third-party sponsors, there is currently no established process in place for the parties to reach a conclusion on an individual loan if there is a disagreement on the resolution of the claim. Private-label securitization investors generally do not have the contractual right to demand repurchase of loans directly or the right to access loan files. Open Mortgage Insurance Rescission Notices In addition to repurchase claims, we receive notices from mortgage insurance companies of claim denials, cancellations or coverage rescission (collectively, MI rescission notices). We had approximately 81,000 open MI rescission notices at September 30, 2014. This amount includes approximately 24,000 open MI rescission notices at September 30, 2014 pertaining to first-lien mortgages sold to the GSEs and loans HFI, of which approximately 15,000 are expected to be resolved when certain MI company settlement agreements have received the consent of the GSEs. At September 30, 2014 , we also had approximately 9,000 open MI rescission notices pertaining principally to first-lien mortgages sold to other investors as well as 48,000 pertaining to second-lien mortgages which are implicated by ongoing litigation where no loan-level review is currently contemplated nor required to preserve the Corporation's legal rights. In this litigation, the litigating mortgage insurance company is also seeking bulk rescission of certain policies, separate and apart from loan-by-loan denials or rescissions . For additional information, see Note 7 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Estimated Range of Possible Loss We currently estimate that the range of possible loss for representations and warranties exposures could be up to $4 billion over existing accruals at September 30, 2014 . The estimated range of possible loss reflects principally non-GSE exposures. It represents a reasonably possible loss, but does not represent a probable loss, and is based on currently available information, significant judgment and a number of assumptions that are subject to change. The liability for representations and warranties exposures and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss do not consider any losses related to litigation matters, including RMBS litigation or litigation brought by monoline insurers, nor do they include any separate foreclosure costs and related costs, assessments and compensatory fees or any other possible losses related to potential claims for breaches of performance of servicing obligations (except as such losses are included as potential costs of the BNY Mellon Settlement), potential securities law or fraud claims or potential indemnity or other claims against us, including claims related to loans insured by the FHA . We are not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any possible loss with respect to any such servicing, securities law, fraud or other claims against us, except to the extent reflected in existing accruals or the estimated range of possible loss for litigation and regulatory matters disclosed in Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements ; however, in light of the inherent uncertainties involved in these matters and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period. Future provisions and/or ranges of possible loss for representations and warranties may be significantly impacted if actual experiences are different from our assumptions in our predictive models, including, without limitation, ultimate resolution of the BNY Mellon Settlement, estimated repurchase rates, estimated MI rescission rates, economic conditions, estimated home prices, consumer and counterparty behavior, the applicable statute of limitations and a variety of other judgmental factors. For more information on the methodology used to estimate the representations and warranties liability and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss, see Note 7 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation's 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Department of Justice Settlement On August 20, 2014, we reached a comprehensive settlement with the DoJ, the SEC and State Attorneys General from California, Delaware, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland and New York (State AGs), all of which are members of the Residential Mortgage Backed Securities Working Group of the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force; the FHA; GNMA; and the FDIC. The claims primarily related to mortgage securitization, origination, sale and other specified conduct by Countrywide and Merrill Lynch prior to the Corporation's acquisition of those entities, relating to RMBS, CDOs and residential mortgage loans. The DoJ Settlement also resolved all pending RMBS claims against Bank of America entities brought by the FDIC. 59 Table of Contents Under the DoJ Settlement, we agreed to pay a total of $9.65 billion in cash and provide $7.0 billion worth of consumer relief. The cash portion consists of $5.02 billion in civil monetary penalties and $4.63 billion in compensatory remediation payments, of which $9.16 billion was paid in October 2014 with the balance paid in November 2014. After considering previously established reserves, we recorded a pretax charge of $5.3 billion in the third quarter of 2014 to pay the costs associated with the DoJ Settlement. Of this third-quarter charge, $4.9 billion was recorded in litigation expense and $400 million was recorded in the provision for credit losses for additional costs associated with the consumer relief portion of the settlement. Consumer relief will be in the form of mortgage modifications, including first-lien principal and forbearance forgiveness and second-lien extinguishments, low- to moderate-income mortgage originations, and community reinvestment and neighborhood stabilization efforts, with initiatives focused on communities experiencing, or at risk of, urban blight. This includes lien releases, uninhabitable and abandoned property demolition, and remediation and property donations. Also, we will support the expansion of available affordable rental housing. We have committed to complete delivery of the consumer relief by no later than August 31, 2018. The consumer relief is subject to oversight by an independent monitor. The DoJ Settlement resolved matters pertaining to certain pending civil enforcement investigations, including investigations by the DoJ and the State AGs relating to RMBS, CDOs and related mortgage activities, including origination, by the Corporation, Countrywide, Merrill Lynch and their affiliates. The claims released include current and potential claims for securitization-related conduct occurring prior to January 1, 2009 under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA). The DoJ Settlement also included origination releases with respect to all residential mortgage loans originated by the Corporation and its legacy entities that were sold to private-label trusts and securitized prior to January 1, 2009; all residential mortgage loans sold to the GSEs by the Corporation or Countrywide prior to December 31, 2013; and all FHA-guaranteed residential mortgage loans originated by the Corporation or Countrywide on or after May 1, 2009, on which claims were submitted to the FHA on or before December 31, 2013. Certain civil RMBS actions filed by the DoJ and the SEC in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina were resolved by the DoJ Settlement. As a result of the resolution of the SEC action, certain affiliates of the Corporation consented to be enjoined. When the injunctions are issued, the Corporation and certain of its affiliates will be disqualified from certain activities, potentially including the ability to sell certain third-party alternative investment products, unless they obtain waivers from such disqualifications. The Corporation and its affiliates have requested waivers from the disqualifications. If one or more of those waivers are not obtained, it may negatively affect certain of our business activities, which could impact our results of operations. For additional information, see Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Servicing, Foreclosure and Other Mortgage Matters We service a large portion of the loans we or our subsidiaries have securitized and also service loans on behalf of third-party securitization vehicles and other investors. Our servicing obligations are set forth in servicing agreements with the applicable counterparty. These obligations may include, but are not limited to, loan repurchase requirements in certain circumstances, indemnifications, payment of fees, advances for foreclosure costs that are not reimbursable, or responsibility for losses in excess of partial guarantees for VA loans. Servicing agreements with the GSEs generally provide the GSEs with broader rights relative to the servicer than are found in servicing agreements with private investors. The GSEs claim that they have the contractual right to demand indemnification or loan repurchase for certain servicing breaches. In addition, the GSEs' first-lien mortgage seller/servicer guides provide timelines to resolve delinquent loans through workout efforts or liquidation, if necessary, and purport to require the imposition of compensatory fees if those deadlines are not satisfied except for reasons beyond the control of the servicer. In addition, many non-agency RMBS and whole-loan servicing agreements state that the servicer may be liable for failure to perform its servicing obligations in keeping with industry standards or for acts or omissions that involve willful malfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of, or reckless disregard of, the servicer's duties. It is not possible to reasonably estimate our liability with respect to certain potential servicing-related claims. While we have recorded certain accruals for servicing-related claims, the amount of potential liability in excess of existing accruals could be material to the Corporation's results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period. 2011 OCC Consent Order and 2013 IFR Acceleration Agreement For information on the 2011 OCC Consent Order and 2013 IFR Acceleration Agreement, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations 2011 OCC Consent Order and 2013 IFR Acceleration Agreement on page 57 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 60 Table of Contents National Mortgage Settlement In March 2012, we entered into the National Mortgage Settlement with the DoJ, various federal regulatory agencies and 49 State Attorneys General to resolve federal and state investigations into certain residential mortgage origination, servicing and foreclosure practices. Our compliance with these servicing standards is subject to ongoing review by an independent monitor who has confirmed that we have fulfilled all national and state obligations with respect to borrower assistance. For more information on the National Mortgage Settlement, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations National Mortgage Settlement on page 57 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. For information on Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. on page 58 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Impact of Foreclosure Delays Foreclosure delays impact our default-related servicing costs, which include mortgage-related assessments, waivers and similar costs, which have been declining since late 2012. We recorded $74 million of mortgage-related assessments, waivers and similar costs related to foreclosure delays in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $459 million in the same period in 2013 . Delays in foreclosure sales beyond those currently anticipated and any issues that may arise out of alleged irregularities in our foreclosure process could significantly increase the costs associated with our mortgage operations. Other Mortgage-related Matters We continue to be subject to additional borrower and non-borrower litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny related to our past and current origination, servicing, transfer of servicing and servicing rights, and foreclosure activities, including those claims not covered by the National Mortgage Settlement or the DoJ Settlement. This scrutiny may extend beyond our pending foreclosure matters to issues arising out of alleged irregularities with respect to previously completed foreclosure activities. For more information on management's estimate of the aggregate range of possible loss and on regulatory investigations, see Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Mortgage-related Settlements Servicing Matters In connection with the BNY Mellon Settlement, BANA has agreed to implement certain servicing changes related to loss mitigation activities. BANA also agreed to transfer the servicing rights related to certain high-risk loans to qualified subservicers on a schedule that began with the signing of the BNY Mellon Settlement. This servicing transfer protocol has reduced the servicing fees payable to BANA. Upon final court approval of the BNY Mellon Settlement, failure to meet the established benchmarking standards for loans not in subservicing arrangements can trigger payment of agreed-upon fees. Additionally, we and Countrywide have agreed to work to resolve with the Trustee certain mortgage documentation issues related to the enforceability of mortgages in foreclosure and to reimburse the related Covered Trust for any loss if BANA is unable to foreclose on the mortgage and the Covered Trust is not made whole by a title policy because of these issues. These agreements will terminate if final court approval of the BNY Mellon Settlement is not obtained, although we could still have exposure under the pooling and servicing agreements related to the mortgages in the Covered Trusts for these issues. In connection with the National Mortgage Settlement, BANA has agreed to implement certain additional servicing changes. The uniform servicing standards established under the National Mortgage Settlement are broadly consistent with the residential mortgage servicing practices imposed by the 2011 OCC Consent Order; however, they are more prescriptive and cover a broader range of our residential mortgage servicing activities. These standards are intended to strengthen procedural safeguards and documentation requirements associated with foreclosure, bankruptcy and loss mitigation activities, as well as addressing the imposition of fees and the integrity of documentation, with a goal of ensuring greater transparency for borrowers. These uniform servicing standards also obligate us to implement compliance processes reasonably designed to provide assurance of the achievement of these objectives. Compliance with the uniform servicing standards is being assessed by a monitor based on the measurement of outcomes with respect to these objectives. Implementation of these uniform servicing standards has contributed to elevated costs associated with the servicing process, but is not expected to result in material delays or dislocation in the performance of our mortgage servicing obligations, including the completion of foreclosures. 61 Table of Contents Regulatory Matters Derivatives Under Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) rules, swap dealers are now required to clear certain interest rate and index credit derivative transactions as well as execute those transactions on designated contract markets or swap execution facilities when facing all counterparty types unless either counterparty is exempt from the clearing mandate. The timing for margin and capital implementation remains unknown, although the prudential regulators and the CFTC have re-proposed, but not finalized, their margin rules for uncleared swaps. In Europe, final rules for clearing certain interest rate swaps under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation have been published and are expected to take effect in February 2015, subject to certain phase-in provisions. Draft rules for clearing some credit default swaps and foreign exchange non-deliverable forwards have also been published. Final rules for margin requirements for non-cleared derivatives are expected by the end of 2014, with variation margin expected to apply from December 1, 2015 and initial margin phased in from December 1, 2015 to December 1, 2019. Resolution Planning The Federal Reserve and the FDIC require that BHCs with assets of $50 billion or more, as well as companies designated as systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, submit annually their plans for a rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. If both the Federal Reserve and the FDIC determine that our (or any other BHC's) plan is not credible and we fail to cure the deficiencies in a timely manner, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC may jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth, activities or operations of the Corporation. We submitted our 2014 plan in July 2014 and are required to update it annually. In August 2014, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC completed their reviews of the resolution plans submitted in 2013 by 11 large, complex banking organizations, including Bank of America, and issued letters to each of these banking organizations. Separately, in August 2014, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC issued a joint press release stating that the Board of Directors of the FDIC had determined that the plans submitted by each of the 11 banks were not credible and do not facilitate an orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. However, the Federal Reserve did not join the FDIC in its determination that the submitted plans were not credible. Focus areas identified in the regulatory reviews include the amendment of certain early termination rights in financial contracts, continuity of shared services, operational capabilities for resolution preparedness and legal entity rationalization, including a holding company structure that supports resolvability. Management intends to address these focus areas in our next Resolution Plan, which must be submitted by July 2015. Resolution Planning in the U.K. In the U.K., the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) has issued rules requiring the submission of significant information about certain U.K.-incorporated subsidiaries and other financial institutions, as well as branches of non-U.K. banks located in the U.K. (including information on intra-group dependencies, legal entity separation and barriers to resolution) to allow the PRA to develop resolution plans. As a result of the PRA review, we could be required to take certain actions over the next several years which could impose operating costs and potentially result in the restructuring of certain business and subsidiaries. Debit Interchange Fees On July 31, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued a ruling regarding the Federal Reserve's 2011 rules implementing the Durbin Amendment. The ruling requires the Federal Reserve to reconsider the $0.21 per transaction cap on debit card interchange fees. However, on March 21, 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit overturned the ruling, leaving the Federal Reserve's rule intact. On August 18, 2014, the merchant plaintiffs petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to review the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. The U.S. Supreme Court has not yet indicated whether it will review the decision.

Risk Factors of the Corporation's 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K . For more information on the SLR final rules, see Capital Management Other Regulatory Capital Matters on page 71 , and on the LCR final rules, see Liquidity Risk Basel 3 Liquidity Standards on page 76 . 62 Table of Contents Credit Risk Retention In October 2014, U.S. regulators jointly approved a final rule regarding credit risk retention that will, among other things, require sponsors in certain circumstances to retain at least five percent of the credit risk of the assets underlying certain ABS and MBS securitizations and would limit sponsors' ability to transfer or hedge that credit risk. We are evaluating the final rule and anticipate that it will likely adversely impact our ability to engage in certain types of MBS and ABS securitizations and resecuritizations. It will likely also impose additional operational and compliance costs, and may negatively influence the value, liquidity and transferability of some ABS or MBS, loans and other assets. However, the ultimate impacts remain unclear. The rule will become effective after it is published in the Federal Register, one year after for RMBS and two years after for all other asset classes. Managing Risk Risk is inherent in every material business activity that we undertake. Our business exposes us to strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. We must manage these risks to maximize our long-term results by ensuring the integrity of our assets and the quality of our earnings. We take a comprehensive approach to risk management. We have a defined risk framework and articulated risk appetite which are approved annually by the Board. Risk management planning is integrated with strategic, financial and customer/client planning so that goals and responsibilities are aligned across the organization. Risk is managed in a systematic manner by focusing on the Corporation as a whole as well as managing risk across the enterprise and within individual business units, products, services and transactions, and across all geographic locations. We maintain a governance structure that delineates the responsibilities for risk management activities, as well as governance and oversight of those activities. For a more detailed discussion of our risk management activities, see the discussion below and pages 61 through 117 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Strategic Risk Management Strategic risk is embedded in every business and is one of the major risk categories along with credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. It is the risk that results from incorrect assumptions, unsuitable business plans, ineffective strategy execution, or failure to respond in a timely manner to changes in the regulatory, macroeconomic and competitive environments, customer preferences, and technology developments in the geographic locations in which we operate. Our appetite for strategic risk is assessed based on the strategic plan, with strategic risks selectively and carefully considered against the backdrop of the evolving marketplace. Strategic risk is managed in the context of our overall financial condition, risk appetite and stress test results, among other considerations. The chief executive officer and executive management team manage and act on significant strategic actions, such as divestitures, consolidation of legal entities or capital actions subsequent to required review and approval by the Board. For more information on our strategic risk management activities, see page 65 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 63 Table of Contents Capital Management The Corporation manages its capital position to maintain sufficient capital to support its business activities and maintain capital, risk and risk appetite commensurate with one another. Additionally, we seek to maintain safety and soundness at all times including under adverse conditions, take advantage of potential growth opportunities, maintain ready access to financial markets, continue to serve as a credit intermediary, remain a source of strength for our subsidiaries, and satisfy current and future regulatory capital requirements. Capital management is integrated into our risk and governance processes, as capital is a key consideration in the development of the strategic plan, risk appetite and risk limits. We set goals for capital ratios to meet key stakeholder expectations, including investors, regulators and rating agencies, and to achieve our financial performance objectives and strategic goals, while maintaining adequate capital, including during periods of stress. We assess capital adequacy at least on a quarterly basis to operate in a safe and sound manner and maintain adequate capital in relation to the risks associated with our business activities and strategy. We conduct an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) on a quarterly basis. The ICAAP is a forward-looking assessment of our projected capital needs and resources, incorporating earnings, balance sheet and risk forecasts under baseline and adverse economic and market conditions. We utilize quarterly stress tests to assess the potential impacts to our balance sheet, earnings, regulatory capital and liquidity under a variety of stress scenarios. We perform qualitative risk assessments to identify and assess material risks not fully captured in our forecasts, stress tests or economic capital. We assess the capital impacts of proposed changes to regulatory capital requirements. Management assesses ICAAP results and provides documented quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our capital guidelines and capital position to the Board or its committees. The Corporation periodically reviews capital allocated to its businesses and allocates capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. We utilize a methodology that considers the effect of regulatory capital requirements in addition to internal risk-based capital models. The Corporation's internal risk-based capital models use a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment's credit, market, interest rate, business and operational risk components. For more information on the nature of these risks, see Managing Risk and Strategic Risk Management on page 63 . The capital allocated to the business segments is referred to as allocated capital, which represents a non-GAAP financial measure. During the latest annual planning process, we made refinements to the amount of capital allocated to each of our businesses based on multiple considerations that included, but were not limited to, Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced risk-weighted assets, business segment exposures and risk profile, and strategic plans. As a result of this process, in 2014, we adjusted the amount of capital being allocated to our business segments. For more information on the refined methodology, see Business Segment Operations on page 28 . CCAR and Capital Planning The Federal Reserve requires BHCs to submit a capital plan and requests for capital actions on an annual basis, consistent with the rules governing the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) capital plan. The CCAR capital plan is the central element of the Federal Reserve's approach to ensure that large BHCs have adequate capital and robust processes for managing their capital. On August 6, 2014, the Federal Reserve informed us that it did not object to the requested capital actions in our revised 2014 CCAR capital plan. The requested capital actions included an increase in the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.05 per share from $0.01 per share, but no additional common stock repurchases. The requested actions cover the period from the third quarter of 2014 through the first quarter of 2015. For more information on our previously announced 2014 capital actions, see Capital Management on page 64 of the Corporation's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2014 . Regulatory Capital As a financial services holding company, we are subject to regulatory capital rules issued by U.S. banking regulators. On January 1, 2014, we became subject to the Basel 3 rules, which include certain transition provisions through 2018. Basel 3 generally continues to be subject to interpretation by U.S. banking regulators. The Corporation and its primary affiliated banking entity, BANA, meet the definition of an advanced approaches bank and measure regulatory capital adequacy based on the Basel 3 rules. Through December 31, 2013, we were subject to the Basel 1 general risk-based capital rules which included new measures of market risk including a charge related to stressed Value-at-Risk (VaR), an incremental risk charge and the comprehensive risk measure (CRM), as well as other technical modifications to Basel 1 (the Basel 1 2013 Rules ) . For more information on the regulatory capital amounts and calculations, see Basel 3 below. 64 Table of Contents Basel 3 Basel 3 materially changes Tier 1 and Total capital calculations and formally establishes a common equity tier 1 capital ratio. Basel 3 introduces new minimum capital ratios and buffer requirements and a supplementary leverage ratio; changes the composition of regulatory capital; revises the adequately capitalized minimum requirements under the Prompt Corrective Action framework; expands and modifies the risk-sensitive calculation of risk-weighted assets for credit and market risk (the Advanced approaches); and introduces a Standardized approach for the calculation of risk-weighted assets. For more information on the supplementary leverage ratio, see Capital Management Other Regulatory Capital Matters on page 71 . As an advanced approaches bank, under Basel 3, we are required to complete a qualification period (parallel run) to demonstrate compliance with the final Basel 3 rules to the satisfaction of U.S. banking regulators. Upon notification of approval by U.S. banking regulators to exit the parallel run, we will be required to calculate regulatory capital ratios and risk-weighted assets under both the Standardized approach and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is to be used to assess capital adequacy including under the Prompt Corrective Action framework. Prior to receipt of notification of approval, we are required to assess our capital adequacy under the Standardized approach only. The Prompt Corrective Action framework establishes categories of capitalization, including "well capitalized," based on regulatory ratio requirements. U.S. banking regulators are required to take certain mandatory actions depending on the category of capitalization, with no mandatory actions required for "well-capitalized" banking entities. On January 1, 2015, common equity tier 1 capital will be included in the "well-capitalized" category. Under the Basel 3 transition provisions in effect through December 31, 2014, the Standardized approach uses risk-weighted assets as measured under the Basel 1 2013 Rules in the determination of the Basel 3 Standardized approach capital ratios (Basel 3 Standardized Transition). For more information on how risk-weighted assets are measured under the Basel 1 2013 Rules, see Capital Management Regulatory Capital on page 65 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Effective January 1, 2015, the Prompt Corrective Action framework is amended to reflect the new capital requirements under Basel 3. Regulatory Capital Composition Transition Important differences in determining the composition of regulatory capital between the Basel 1 2013 Rules and Basel 3 include changes in capital deductions related to our MSRs, deferred tax assets and defined benefit pension assets, and the inclusion of unrealized gains and losses on AFS debt and certain marketable equity securities recorded in accumulated OCI. These changes will be impacted by future changes in interest rates, overall earnings performance or other corporate actions. Changes to the composition of regulatory capital under Basel 3, such as recognizing the impact of unrealized gains or losses on AFS debt securities in common equity tier 1 capital, are subject to a transition period where the impact is recognized in 20 percent annual increments. These regulatory capital adjustments and deductions will be fully recognized in 2018. The phase-in period for the new minimum capital ratio requirements and related buffers under Basel 3 is from January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2018. When presented on a fully phased-in basis, capital, risk-weighted assets and the capital ratios assume all regulatory capital adjustments and deductions are fully recognized. Table 18 summarizes how certain regulatory capital deductions and adjustments have been or will be transitioned from 2014 through 2018 for common equity tier 1 and Tier 1 capital. Table 18 Summary of Certain Basel 3 Regulatory Capital Transition Provisions Beginning on January 1 of each year 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Common equity tier 1 capital Percent of total amount deducted from common equity tier 1 capital includes: 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Deferred tax assets arising from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards; intangibles, other than mortgage servicing rights and goodwill; defined benefit pension fund net assets; net unrealized cumulative gains (losses) related to changes in own credit risk on liabilities, including derivatives, measured at fair value; direct and indirect investments in own common equity tier 1 capital instruments; certain amounts exceeding the threshold by 10 percent individually and 15 percent in aggregate Percent of total amount used to adjust common equity tier 1 capital includes (1) : 80% 60% 40% 20% 0% Net unrealized gains (losses) on AFS debt and certain marketable equity securities recorded in accumulated OCI; employee benefit plan adjustments recorded in accumulated OCI Tier 1 capital Percent of total amount deducted from Tier 1 capital includes: 80% 60% 40% 20% 0% Deferred tax assets arising from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards; defined benefit pension fund net assets; net unrealized cumulative gains (losses) related to changes in own credit risk on liabilities, including derivatives, measured at fair value (1) Represents the phase-out percentage of the exclusion by year (e.g., 20 percent of net unrealized gains (losses) on AFS debt and certain marketable equity securities recorded in accumulated OCI will be included in 2014). 65 Table of Contents Additionally, Basel 3 revised the regulatory capital treatment for Trust Securities, requiring them to be partially transitioned from Tier 1 capital into Tier 2 capital in 2014 and 2015, until fully excluded from Tier 1 capital in 2016, and partially transitioned and excluded from Tier 2 capital beginning in 2016. The exclusion from Tier 2 capital starts at 40 percent on January 1, 2016, increasing 10 percent each year until the full amount is excluded from Tier 2 capital beginning on January 1, 2022. As of September 30, 2014 , our qualifying Trust Securities were $2.9 billion (approximately 23 bps of Tier 1 capital) and will no longer qualify as Tier 1 capital or Tier 2 capital beginning in 2016, subject to the transition provisions. Standardized Approach The Basel 3 Standardized approach measures risk-weighted assets primarily for market risk and credit risk exposures. Exposures subject to market risk, as defined under the rules, are measured on a basis generally consistent with how market risk-weighted assets were measured under the Basel 1 2013 Rules. Credit risk exposures are measured by applying fixed risk weights to each exposure, determined based on the characteristics of the exposure, such as type of obligor, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) country risk code and maturity, among others. Under the Standardized approach, no distinction is made for variations in credit quality for corporate exposures, and the economic benefit of collateral is restricted to a limited list of eligible securities and cash. Some key differences between the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that the Advanced approaches include a measure of operational risk and a credit valuation adjustment (CVA) capital charge in credit risk and rely on internal analytical models to measure credit risk-weighted assets. We estimate our common equity tier 1 capital ratio under the Basel 3 Standardized approach, on a fully phased-in basis, to be 9.5 percent at September 30, 2014 . As of September 30, 2014 , we estimated that our Basel 3 Standardized common equity tier 1 capital would be $135.1 billion and total risk-weighted assets would be $1,418 billion , on a fully phased-in basis. This does not include the benefit of the removal of the surcharge applicable to the CRM. For a reconciliation of Basel 3 Standardized Transition to Basel 3 Standardized estimates on a fully phased-in basis for common equity tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets, see Table 21 . Our estimates under the Basel 3 Standardized approach may be refined over time as a result of further rulemaking or clarification by U.S. banking regulators or as our understanding and interpretation of the rules evolve. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. Advanced Approaches Under the Basel 3 Advanced approaches, risk-weighted assets are determined primarily for market risk and credit risk, similar to the Standardized approach, and also incorporate operational risk. Market risk capital measurements are consistent with the Standardized approach, except for securitization exposures, where the Supervisory Formula Approach is also permitted, and certain differences arising from the inclusion of the CVA capital charge in the credit risk capital measurement. Credit risk exposures are measured using internal ratings-based models to determine the applicable risk weight by estimating the probability of default, loss-given default (LGD) and, in certain instances, exposure at default (EAD). The internal analytical models primarily rely on internal historical default and loss experience. Operational risk is measured using internal analytical models which rely on both internal and external operational loss experience and data. The calculations under Basel 3 require management to make estimates, assumptions and interpretations, including the probability of future events based on historical experience. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. The Basel 3 Advanced approaches require approval by the U.S. regulatory agencies of our internal analytical models used to calculate risk-weighted assets. We estimated our common equity tier 1 capital ratio under the Basel 3 Advanced approaches, on a fully phased-in basis, to be 9.6 percent at September 30, 2014 . As of September 30, 2014 , we estimated that our Basel 3 Advanced common equity tier 1 capital would be $135.1 billion and total risk-weighted assets would be $1,410 billion , on a fully phased-in basis. These estimates assume approval by U.S. banking regulators of our internal analytical models, but do not include the benefit of the removal of the surcharge applicable to the CRM. Our estimates under the Basel 3 Advanced approaches may be refined over time as a result of further rulemaking or clarification by U.S. banking regulators or as our understanding and interpretation of the rules evolve. If our internal analytical models are not approved, it would likely lead to an increase in our risk-weighted assets, which in some cases could be significant. 66 Table of Contents Capital Composition and Ratios Table 19 presents Bank of America Corporation's capital ratios and related information in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized Transition as measured at September 30, 2014 and the Basel 1 2013 Rules at December 31, 2013 .

(2) On a pro-forma basis, under Basel 3 Standardized Transition, the December 31, 2013 common equity tier 1 capital and ratio would have been $152.7 billion and 11.6 percent, and risk-weighted assets would have been $1,316 billion. (3) Reflects adjusted average total assets for the three months ended September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . n/a = not applicable Common equity tier 1 capital under Basel 3 Standardized Transition was $152.4 billion at September 30, 2014 , an increase of $10.9 billion from Tier 1 common capital under the Basel 1 2013 Rules at December 31, 2013 . The increase was largely attributable to the impact of certain transition provisions under Basel 3 Standardized Transition, particularly in regard to deferred tax assets, and earnings. For more information on Basel 3 transition provisions, see Table 18 . During the nine months ended September 30, 2014 , Total capital increased $4.2 billion primarily driven by the increase in common equity tier 1 capital, partially offset by the impact of certain transition provisions under Basel 3 Standardized Transition, particularly in regard to long-term debt that qualifies as Tier 2 capital. The Tier 1 leverage ratio increased 23 bps for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to December 31, 2013 primarily driven by an increase in Tier 1 capital. For additional information, see Tables 19 and 20 . 67 Table of Contents At September 30, 2014 , an increase or decrease in our common equity tier 1, Tier 1 or Total capital ratios by one bp would require a change of $127 million in common equity tier 1, Tier 1 or Total capital. We could also increase our common equity tier 1, Tier 1 or Total capital ratios by one bp on such date by a reduction in risk-weighted assets of $1.1 billion, $991 million or $805 million, respectively. An increase in our Tier 1 leverage ratio by one bp on such date would require $206 million of additional Tier 1 capital or a reduction of $2.6 billion in adjusted average assets. Risk-weighted assets decreased $26 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to $1,272 billion primarily due to decreases in residential mortgage and consumer credit card balances, partially offset by the impact of certain transition provisions under the Basel 3 Standardized Transition and an increase in commercial loans.

The Total capital ratio increased seven bps to 13.9 percent at September 30, 2014 compared to December 31, 2013 . The Tier 1 leverage ratio decreased 19 bps to 9.0 percent at September 30, 2014 compared to December 31, 2013 . The increase in the Total capital ratio was driven by the same factors as the Tier 1 capital ratio. The decrease in the Tier 1 leverage ratio was driven by an increase in adjusted quarterly average total assets, partially offset by a slight increase in Tier 1 capital. FIA's Tier 1 capital ratio under Basel 3 Standardized Transition was 17.1 percent at September 30, 2014 , an increase of 23 bps from December 31, 2013 . The Total capital ratio increased 22 bps to 18.3 percent at September 30, 2014 compared to December 31, 2013 . The Tier 1 leverage ratio increased 55 bps to 13.5 percent at September 30, 2014 compared to December 31, 2013 . The increases in the Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios were driven by a decrease in risk-weighted assets and earnings, partially offset by returns of capital to the parent company compared to December 31, 2013 . The increase in the Tier 1 leverage ratio was driven by a decrease in adjusted quarterly average total assets, partially offset by a decrease in Tier 1 capital. 70 Table of Contents Other Regulatory Capital Matters Supplementary Leverage Ratio Basel 3 also will require the calculation of a supplementary leverage ratio (SLR). The SLR is determined by dividing Tier 1 capital, using quarter-end Basel 3 Tier 1 capital on a fully phased-in basis, by supplementary leverage exposure calculated as the daily average of the sum of on-balance sheet as well as the simple average of certain off-balance sheet exposures at the end of each month in the quarter. Supplementary leverage exposure is comprised of all on-balance sheet assets, plus a measure of certain off-balance sheet exposures, including among other items, lending commitments, letters of credit, over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, repo-style transactions and margin loan commitments. We will be required to disclose our SLR effective January 1, 2015. Effective January 1, 2018, the Corporation will be required to maintain a minimum SLR of three percent, plus a supplementary leverage buffer of two percent, for a total SLR of five percent. If the Corporation's supplementary leverage buffer is not greater than or equal to two percent, then the Corporation will be subject to mandatory limits on its ability to make distributions of capital to shareholders, whether through dividends, stock repurchases or otherwise. In addition, the insured depository institutions of such BHCs, which for the Corporation is primarily BANA, will be required to maintain a minimum six percent SLR to be considered "well capitalized." On September 3, 2014, U.S. banking regulators adopted a final rule to revise the definition and scope of the denominator of the SLR. The final rule prescribes the calculation of total leverage exposure, the frequency of calculation and required disclosures. The definition of total leverage exposure is revised to include the effective notional principal amount of credit derivatives and other similar instruments through which credit protection is sold. Calculations of the components of total leverage exposure for derivative and repo-style transactions are modified. The credit conversion factors (CCF) applied to certain off-balance sheet exposures are conformed to the graduated CCF used by the Standardized approach, subject to the minimum 10 percent credit conversion factor. As of September 30, 2014 , based on the proposed changes to the supplementary leverage exposure, we estimate the Corporation's SLR to be approximately 5.5 percent , which exceeds the 5.0 percent minimum for BHCs. On October 1, 2014, we successfully completed the merger of FIA and BANA. The estimated pro-forma SLR for the combined entity was approximately 6.8 percent . Systemically Important Financial Institution Buffer In November 2011, the Basel Committee published a methodology to identify global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) and impose an additional loss absorbency requirement through the introduction of a buffer of up to 3.5 percent for systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs). The assessment methodology relies on an indicator-based measurement approach to determine a score relative to the global banking industry. The chosen indicators are size, complexity, cross-jurisdictional activity, interconnectedness and substitutability/financial institution infrastructure. Institutions with the highest scores are designated as G-SIBs and are assigned to one of four loss absorbency buckets from one percent to 2.5 percent, in 0.5 percent increments based on each institution's relative score and supervisory judgment. The fifth loss absorbency bucket of 3.5 percent is currently empty and serves to discourage banks from becoming more systemically important. In July 2013, the Basel Committee updated the November 2011 methodology to recalibrate the substitutability/financial institution infrastructure indicator by introducing a cap on the weighting of that component, and requiring the annual publication by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) of key information necessary to permit each G-SIB to calculate its score and observe its position within the buckets and relative to the industry total for each indicator. Every three years, beginning on January 1, 2016, the Basel Committee will reconsider and recalibrate the bucket thresholds. The Basel Committee and FSB expect banks to change their behavior in response to the incentives of the G-SIB framework, as well as other aspects of Basel 3 and jurisdiction-specific regulations. The SIFI buffer requirement will begin to phase in effective January 2016, with full implementation in January 2019. Data from 2013, measured as of December 31, 2013, will be used to determine the SIFI buffer that will be effective for us in 2016. As of September 30, 2014 , we estimate our SIFI buffer would be 1.5 percent , based on the publication of the key information used in the SIFI methodology by the Basel Committee in November 2013, and considering the FSB's report, "Update of group of global systemically important banks." Our SIFI buffer could change each year based on our actions and those of our peers, as the score used to determine each G-SIB's SIFI buffer is based on the industry total and actions of U.S. banking regulators. If our score were to increase, we could be subject to a higher SIFI buffer requirement. U.S. banking regulators have not yet issued proposed or final rules related to the SIFI buffer or disclosure requirements.

MLPCC is a fully-guaranteed subsidiary of MLPF&S and provides clearing and settlement services. Both entities are subject to the net capital requirements of SEC Rule 15c3-1. Both entities are also registered as futures commission merchants and are subject to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Regulation 1.17. MLPF&S has elected to compute the minimum capital requirement in accordance with the Alternative Net Capital Requirement as permitted by SEC Rule 15c3-1. At September 30, 2014 , MLPF&S's regulatory net capital as defined by Rule 15c3-1 was $10.4 billion and exceeded the minimum requirement of $1.2 billion by $9.2 billion. MLPCC's net capital of $1.8 billion exceeded the minimum requirement of $316 million by $1.5 billion. In accordance with the Alternative Net Capital Requirements, MLPF&S is required to maintain tentative net capital in excess of $1.0 billion, net capital in excess of $500 million and notify the SEC in the event its tentative net capital is less than $5.0 billion. At September 30, 2014 , MLPF&S had tentative net capital and net capital in excess of the minimum and notification requirements. Merrill Lynch International (MLI), a U.K. investment firm, is regulated by the PRA and the Financial Conduct Authority, and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. At September 30, 2014 , MLI's capital resources were $32.2 billion which exceeded the minimum requirement of $17.9 billion with enough excess to cover any additional requirements as set by the regulators. 72 Table of Contents Common and Preferred Stock Dividends For a summary of our declared quarterly cash dividends on common stock during the third quarter of 2014 and through November 6, 2014 , see Note 11 Shareholders' Equity to the Consolidated Financial Statements . The Corporation has certain warrants outstanding and exercisable to purchase 150.4 million shares of its common stock, expiring on January 16, 2019 and warrants outstanding and exercisable to purchase 121.8 million shares of its common stock, expiring on October 18, 2018. These warrants were originally issued in connection with preferred stock issuances to the U.S. Treasury in 2009 and 2008, and are listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The terms of the warrants expiring on January 16, 2019 include a provision that requires an adjustment to the exercise price when the Corporation declares quarterly dividends at a level greater than $0.01 per common share. As a result of our third-quarter 2014 dividend of $0.05 per common share paid on September 26, 2014, the exercise price of the warrants expiring on January 16, 2019 was adjusted from $13.30 to $13.27 . The exercise price of these warrants is subject to continued adjustment each time the quarterly cash dividend is in excess of $0.01 per common share to compensate the shareholder for dilution resulting from an increased dividend, including as a result of the declaration of a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.05 per common share payable on December 26, 2014 to shareholders of record on December 5, 2014. The warrants expiring on October 18, 2018 also contain this anti-dilution provision except the adjustment is triggered only when the Corporation declares quarterly dividends at a level greater than $0.32 per common share. Table 23 is a summary of our cash dividend declarations on preferred stock during the third quarter of 2014 and through November 6, 2014 . During the third quarter of 2014 , cash dividends declared on preferred stock were $238 million .

Liquidity Risk Funding and Liquidity Risk Management We define liquidity risk as the potential inability to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations, on- or off-balance sheet, as they come due. Our primary liquidity objective is to provide adequate funding for our businesses throughout market cycles, including periods of financial stress. To achieve that objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk, maintain excess liquidity and access diverse funding sources including our stable deposit base. We define excess liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we can use to meet our funding requirements as those obligations arise. Global funding and liquidity risk management activities are centralized within Corporate Treasury. We believe that a centralized approach to funding and liquidity risk management enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding sources, minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events. For more information regarding global funding and liquidity risk management, see Liquidity Risk Funding and Liquidity Risk Management on page 71 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Global Excess Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets We maintain excess liquidity available to Bank of America Corporation, or the parent company and selected subsidiaries in the form of cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. These assets, which we call our Global Excess Liquidity Sources, serve as our primary means of liquidity risk mitigation. Our cash is primarily on deposit with the Federal Reserve and central banks outside of the U.S. We limit the composition of high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities to U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency MBS and a select group of non-U.S. government and supranational securities. We believe we can quickly obtain cash for these securities, even in stressed market conditions, through repurchase agreements or outright sales. We hold our Global Excess Liquidity Sources in entities that allow us to meet the liquidity requirements of our global businesses, and we consider the impact of potential regulatory, tax, legal and other restrictions that could limit the transferability of funds among entities. Our Global Excess Liquidity Sources are similar in composition to what qualifies as High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the final LCR rules. For more information on the final rulemaking, see Liquidity Risk Basel 3 Liquidity Standards on page 76 . Our Global Excess Liquidity Sources were $429 billion and $376 billion at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 and were maintained as presented in Table 24 . 74 Table of Contents Table 24 Global Excess Liquidity Sources (Dollars in billions) September 30 2014 December 31 2013 Average for Three Months Ended September 30, 2014 Parent company $ 93 $ 95 $ 89 Bank subsidiaries 302 249 307 Other regulated entities 34 32 34 Total Global Excess Liquidity Sources $ 429 $ 376 $ 430 As shown in Table 24 , parent company Global Excess Liquidity Sources totaled $93 billion and $95 billion at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . The decrease in parent company liquidity was primarily due to the impact of litigation settlements, partially offset by bank subsidiary inflows. Typically, parent company cash is deposited with BANA. Global Excess Liquidity Sources available to our bank subsidiaries totaled $302 billion and $249 billion at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . The increase in bank subsidiaries' liquidity was primarily due to the decrease in loans and increased long-term debt, partially offset by dividends and returns of capital to the parent company. Liquidity amounts at bank subsidiaries exclude the cash deposited by the parent company. Our bank subsidiaries can also generate incremental liquidity by pledging a range of other unencumbered loans and securities to certain Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against this pool of specifically identified eligible assets was approximately $209 billion and $218 billion at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . We have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against these assets, including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loans and securities collateral. Eligibility is defined by guidelines outlined by the FHLBs and the Federal Reserve and is subject to change at their discretion. Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries can only be used to fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries and can only be transferred to the parent company or non-bank subsidiaries with prior regulatory approval. Global Excess Liquidity Sources available to our other regulated entities totaled $34 billion and $32 billion at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . Our other regulated entities also held other unencumbered investment-grade securities and equities that we believe could be used to generate additional liquidity. Liquidity held in an other regulated entity is primarily available to meet the obligations of that entity and transfers to the parent company or to any other subsidiary may be subject to prior regulatory approval due to regulatory restrictions and minimum requirements. Table 25 presents the composition of Global Excess Liquidity Sources at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . Table 25 Global Excess Liquidity Sources Composition (Dollars in billions) September 30 2014 December 31 2013 Cash on deposit $ 89 $ 90 U.S. Treasuries 62 20 U.S. agency securities and mortgage-backed securities 255 245 Non-U.S. government and supranational securities 23 21 Total Global Excess Liquidity Sources $ 429 $ 376 Time-to-required Funding and Stress Modeling We use a variety of metrics to determine the appropriate amounts of excess liquidity to maintain at the parent company, our bank subsidiaries and other regulated entities. One metric we use to evaluate the appropriate level of excess liquidity at the parent company is "time-to-required funding." This debt coverage measure indicates the number of months that the parent company can continue to meet its unsecured contractual obligations as they come due using only its Global Excess Liquidity Sources without issuing any new debt or accessing any additional liquidity sources. We define unsecured contractual obligations for purposes of this metric as maturities of senior or subordinated debt issued or guaranteed by Bank of America Corporation. These include certain unsecured debt instruments, primarily structured liabilities, which we may be required to settle for cash prior to maturity. Our time-to-required funding was 38 months at September 30, 2014 . For purposes of calculating time-to-required funding at September 30, 2014 , we have included in the amount of unsecured contractual obligations $8 billion related to the DoJ Settlement and $8.6 billion related to the BNY Mellon Settlement. In October 2014, we paid $9.2 billion related to the DoJ Settlement of which $7.8 billion was funded by the parent company. The BNY Mellon Settlement is subject to final court approval and certain other conditions, and the timing of payment is not certain. 75 Table of Contents We utilize liquidity stress models to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of excess liquidity to maintain at the parent company, our bank subsidiaries and other regulated entities. These models are risk sensitive and have become increasingly important in analyzing our potential contractual and contingent cash outflows beyond those outflows considered in the time-to-required funding analysis. We evaluate the liquidity requirements under a range of scenarios with varying levels of severity and time horizons. The scenarios we consider and utilize incorporate market-wide and Corporation-specific events, including potential credit rating downgrades for the parent company and our subsidiaries, and are based on historical experience, regulatory guidance, and both expected and unexpected future events. The types of potential contractual and contingent cash outflows we consider in our scenarios may include, but are not limited to, upcoming contractual maturities of unsecured debt and reductions in new debt issuance; diminished access to secured financing markets; potential deposit withdrawals; increased draws on loan commitments, liquidity facilities and letters of credit, including variable rate demand notes; additional collateral that counterparties could call if our credit ratings were downgraded; collateral and margin requirements arising from market value changes; and potential liquidity required to maintain businesses and finance customer activities. Changes in certain market factors, including, but not limited to, credit rating downgrades, could negatively impact potential contractual and contingent outflows and the related financial instruments, and in some cases these impacts could be material to our financial results. We consider all sources of funds that we could access during each stress scenario and focus particularly on matching available sources with corresponding liquidity requirements by legal entity. We also use the stress modeling results to manage our asset-liability profile and establish limits and guidelines on certain funding sources and businesses. Basel 3 Liquidity Standards The Basel Committee has issued two liquidity risk-related standards that are considered part of the Basel 3 liquidity standards: the LCR and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR). The LCR is calculated as the amount of a financial institution's unencumbered, HQLA relative to the estimated net cash outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period of significant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. The Basel Committee's liquidity risk-related standards do not directly apply to U.S. financial institutions currently, and only apply once U.S. rules are finalized by the U.S. banking regulators as has occurred for LCR. On September 3, 2014, the U.S. banking regulators finalized LCR requirements for the largest U.S. financial institutions on a consolidated basis and for their subsidiary depository institutions with total assets greater than $10 billion. Under the final rule, an initial minimum LCR of 80 percent will be required in January 2015, and will thereafter increase in 10 percentage point increments annually through January 2017. These minimum requirements will be applicable to the Corporation on a consolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions. We expect to meet or exceed the final LCR requirements within the regulatory timelines. For more information on our balance sheet actions to reduce risk and increase liquidity related to LCR, see Executive Summary Balance Sheet Overview on page 11 . On October 31, 2014, the Basel Committee issued a final standard for the NSFR, the standard that is intended to reduce funding risk over a longer time horizon. The NSFR is designed to ensure an appropriate amount of stable funding, generally capital and liabilities maturing beyond one year, given the mix of assets and off-balance sheet items. The final standard aligns the NSFR to the LCR and gives more credit to a wider range of funding. The final standard also includes adjustments to the stable funding required for certain types of assets, some of which reduce the stable funding requirement and some of which increase it. Assuming adoption by the U.S. banking regulators, we expect to meet the final NSFR requirement within the regulatory timelines. 76 Table of Contents Diversified Funding Sources We fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits and secured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally coordinated funding strategy. We diversify our funding globally across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups. The primary benefits expected from our centralized funding strategy include greater control, reduced funding costs, wider name recognition by investors and greater flexibility to meet the variable funding requirements of subsidiaries. Where regulations, time zone differences or other business considerations make parent company funding impractical, certain other subsidiaries may issue their own debt. We fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposits, which were $1.11 trillion and $1.12 trillion at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . Deposits are primarily generated by our CBB, GWIM and Global Banking segments. These deposits are diversified by clients, product type and geography, and the majority of our U.S. deposits are insured by the FDIC. We consider a substantial portion of our deposits to be a stable, low-cost and consistent source of funding. We believe this deposit funding is generally less sensitive to interest rate changes, market volatility or changes in our credit ratings than wholesale funding sources. Our lending activities may also be financed through secured borrowings, including credit card securitizations and securitizations with GSEs, the FHA and private-label investors, as well as FHLB loans. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 , $1.1 billion and $4.1 billion of new senior debt was issued to third-party investors from the credit card securitization trusts. Our trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded on a secured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions. We believe funding these activities in the secured financing markets is more cost-efficient and less sensitive to changes in our credit ratings than unsecured financing. Repurchase agreements are generally short-term and often overnight. Disruptions in secured financing markets for financial institutions have occurred in prior market cycles which resulted in adverse changes in terms or significant reductions in the availability of such financing. We manage the liquidity risks arising from secured funding by sourcing funding globally from a diverse group of counterparties, providing a range of securities collateral and pursuing longer durations, when appropriate. For more information on secured financing agreements, see Note 9 Federal Funds Sold or Purchased, Securities Financing Agreements and Short-term Borrowings to the Consolidated Financial Statements . We issue the majority of our long-term unsecured debt at the parent company. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 , we issued $8.3 billion and $26.5 billion of long-term unsecured debt, including structured liabilities of $756 million and $1.9 billion, a majority of which were issued at the parent company. Additionally, in October 2014, we issued $2.0 billion of 4.25% subordinated notes due October 2026. We also issue long-term unsecured debt through BANA in a variety of maturities and currencies to achieve cost-efficient funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity profile. There were no new issuances through BANA during the three months ended September 30, 2014 and $3.3 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 . While the cost and availability of unsecured funding may be negatively impacted by general market conditions or by matters specific to the financial services industry or the Corporation, we seek to mitigate refinancing risk by actively managing the amount of our borrowings that we anticipate will mature within any month or quarter. 77 Table of Contents Table 26 presents the carrying value of aggregate annual contractual maturities of long-term debt at September 30, 2014 . During the nine months ended September 30, 2014 , we had total long-term debt maturities and purchases of $44.6 billion consisting of $29.3 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $519 million for Bank of America, N.A., $6.1 billion of other debt and $8.7 billion of consolidated variable interest entities (VIEs).

We may, from time to time, purchase outstanding debt instruments in various transactions, depending on prevailing market conditions, liquidity and other factors. In addition, our other regulated entities may make markets in our debt instruments to provide liquidity for investors. For more information on long-term debt funding, see Note 11 Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K and for more information regarding funding and liquidity risk management, see page 71 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 78 Table of Contents We use derivative transactions to manage the duration, interest rate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering the characteristics of the assets they are funding. For further details on our ALM activities, see Interest Rate Risk Management for Non-trading Activities on page 128 . We also diversify our unsecured funding sources by issuing various types of debt instruments including structured liabilities, which are debt obligations that pay investors returns linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these liabilities with derivative positions and/or investments in the underlying instruments, so that from a funding perspective, the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We could be required to settle certain structured liability obligations for cash or other securities prior to maturity under certain circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning purposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date. We had outstanding structured liabilities with a carrying value of $41.8 billion and $48.4 billion at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price. Contingency Planning We maintain contingency funding plans that outline our potential responses to liquidity stress events at various levels of severity. These policies and plans are based on stress scenarios and include potential funding strategies and communication and notification procedures that we would implement in the event we experienced stressed liquidity conditions. We periodically review and test the contingency funding plans to validate efficacy and assess readiness. Our U.S. bank subsidiaries can access contingency funding through the Federal Reserve Discount Window. Certain non-U.S. subsidiaries have access to central bank facilities in the jurisdictions in which they operate. While we do not rely on these sources in our liquidity modeling, we maintain the policies, procedures and governance processes that would enable us to access these sources if necessary. Credit Ratings Our borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are impacted by our credit ratings. In addition, credit ratings may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions, including OTC derivatives. Thus, it is our objective to maintain high-quality credit ratings, and management maintains an active dialogue with the rating agencies. Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating agencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other securities, including asset securitizations. Our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies, and they consider a number of factors, including our own financial strength, performance, prospects and operations, as well as factors not under our control. The rating agencies could make adjustments to our ratings at any time, and they provide no assurances that they will maintain our ratings at current levels. Other factors that influence our credit ratings include changes to the rating agencies' methodologies for our industry or certain security types, the rating agencies' assessment of the general operating environment for financial services companies, our mortgage exposures (including litigation), our relative positions in the markets in which we compete, reputation, liquidity position, diversity of funding sources, funding costs, the level and volatility of earnings, corporate governance and risk management policies, capital position, capital management practices, and current or future regulatory and legislative initiatives. All three agencies have indicated that, as a systemically important financial institution, the senior credit ratings of the Corporation and Bank of America, N.A. (or in the case of Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (Moody's), only the ratings of Bank of America, N.A.) currently reflect the expectation that, if necessary, we would receive significant support from the U.S. government, and that they will continue to assess such support in the context of sovereign financial strength and regulatory and legislative developments. 79 Table of Contents On September 29, 2014, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (S&P) completed its application of its newly adopted hybrid security rating criteria to U.S. banks. As a result, and consistent with its treatment of other large U.S. banks, S&P downgraded the ratings of Bank of America's preferred stock and trust preferred securities to BB from BB+. At the same time, the agency affirmed Bank of America's subordinated debt rating at BBB+. Also, on August 22, 2014, S&P affirmed Bank of America's ratings following the announcement of the DoJ Settlement. On March 26, 2014, Fitch Ratings (Fitch) concluded their periodic review of 12 large, complex securities trading and universal banks, including Bank of America Corporation. As a result of this review, Fitch affirmed all of the Corporation's credit ratings and revised its outlook on the ratings to negative from stable. The revised outlook reflects Fitch's expectation that the probability of the U.S. government providing support to a systemically important financial institution during a crisis is likely to decline due to the orderly liquidation provisions of the Financial Reform Act. On November 14, 2013, Moody's concluded its review of the ratings for Bank of America and certain other systemically important U.S. BHCs, affirming our current ratings and noting that those ratings no longer incorporate any uplift for U.S. government support. Concurrently, Moody's upgraded Bank of America, N.A.'s senior debt and stand-alone ratings by one notch, citing a number of positive developments at Bank of America. Moody's also moved its outlook for all of our ratings to stable. Table 28 presents the Corporation's current long-term/short-term senior debt ratings and outlooks expressed by the rating agencies.

In addition, under the terms of certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements, in the event of downgrades of our or our rated subsidiaries' credit ratings, the counterparties to those agreements may require us to provide additional collateral, or to terminate these contracts or agreements, which could cause us to sustain losses and/or adversely impact our liquidity. If the short-term credit ratings of our parent company, bank or broker-dealer subsidiaries were downgraded by one or more levels, the potential loss of access to short-term funding sources such as repo financing and the effect on our incremental cost of funds could be material. Table 29 presents the amount of additional collateral contractually required by derivative contracts and other trading agreements at September 30, 2014 if the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for the Corporation or certain subsidiaries by one incremental notch and by an additional second incremental notch.

For more information on potential impacts of credit rating downgrades, see Liquidity Risk Time-to-required Funding and Stress Modeling on page 75 . For more information on the additional collateral and termination payments that could be required in connection with certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements as a result of such a credit rating downgrade, see Note 2 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation's 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K . On June 6, 2014, S&P affirmed its AA+ long-term and A-1+ short-term sovereign credit rating on the U.S. government with a stable outlook. On March 21, 2014, Fitch affirmed its AAA long-term and F1+ short-term sovereign credit rating on the U.S. government with a stable outlook. This resolved the rating watch negative that was placed on the ratings on October 15, 2013. On July 18, 2013, Moody's revised its outlook on the U.S. government to stable from negative and affirmed its Aaa long-term sovereign credit rating on the U.S. government. 81 Table of Contents Credit Risk Management Credit quality continued to improve during the third quarter of 2014 due in part to improving economic conditions. In addition, our proactive credit risk management activities positively impacted the credit portfolio as charge-offs and delinquencies continued to improve. For additional information, see Executive Summary Third-Quarter 2014 Economic and Business Environment on page 4 . We proactively refine our underwriting and credit management practices as well as credit standards to meet the changing economic environment. To actively mitigate losses and enhance customer support in our consumer businesses, we have in place collection programs and loan modification and customer assistance infrastructures. We utilize a number of actions to mitigate losses in the commercial businesses including increasing the frequency and intensity of portfolio monitoring, hedging activity and our practice of transferring management of deteriorating commercial exposures to independent special asset officers as credits enter criticized categories. We have non-U.S. exposure largely in Europe and Asia Pacific. For more information on our exposures and related risks in non-U.S. countries, see Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 114 and Item 1A.

Statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio management including underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting credit limits, and establishing operating processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns. Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources such as credit bureaus and/or internal historical experience. These models are a component of our consumer credit risk management process and are used in part to assist in making both new and ongoing credit decisions, as well as portfolio management strategies, including authorizations and line management, collection practices and strategies, and determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allocated capital for credit risk. During the nine months ended September 30, 2014 , we completed approximately 58,000 customer loan modifications with a total unpaid principal balance of approximately $10 billion, including approximately 26,700 permanent modifications, under the U.S. government's Making Home Affordable Program. Of the loan modifications completed during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 , in terms of both the volume of modifications and the unpaid principal balance associated with the underlying loans, approximately half were in the Corporation's HFI portfolio. For modified loans on our balance sheet, these modification types are generally considered troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). For more information on TDRs and portfolio impacts, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Nonperforming Consumer Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity on page 100 and Note 4 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Consumer Credit Portfolio Improvement in the U.S. economy, labor markets and home prices continued during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 resulting in improved credit quality and lower credit losses across all major consumer portfolios compared to the same periods in 2013 . Consumer loans 30 days or more past due declined during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 across all consumer portfolios as a result of improved delinquency trends. Although home prices have shown steady improvement since the beginning of 2012, they have not fully recovered to their 2006 levels. Improved credit quality, increased home prices and continued loan balance run-off across the consumer portfolio drove a $2.7 billion decrease in the consumer allowance for loan and lease losses during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to $10.7 billion at September 30, 2014 . For additional information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 117 .

Nonperforming loans do not include past due consumer credit card loans, other unsecured loans and in general, consumer non-real estate-secured loans (loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy are included) as these loans are typically charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due. Real estate-secured past due consumer loans that are insured by the FHA or individually insured under long-term standby agreements with FNMA and FHLMC (collectively, the fully-insured loan portfolio) are reported as accruing as opposed to nonperforming since the principal repayment is insured. Fully-insured loans included in accruing past due 90 days or more are primarily from our repurchases of delinquent FHA loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA. Additionally, nonperforming loans and accruing balances past due 90 days or more do not include the PCI loan portfolio or loans accounted for under the fair value option even though the customer may be contractually past due.

These write-offs decreased the PCI valuation allowance included as part of the allowance for loan and lease losses. For more information on PCI write-offs, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio on page 95 . (2) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as annualized net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans and leases excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option. Net charge-off ratios, excluding the PCI and fully-insured loan portfolios, were 0.15 percent and 0.14 percent for residential mortgage, 0.43 percent and 1.00 percent for home equity, and 0.90 percent and 1.07 percent for the total consumer portfolio for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 , respectively. Net charge-off ratios, excluding the PCI and fully-insured loan portfolios, were 0.60 percent and 0.80 percent for residential mortgage, 1.31 percent and 2.09 percent for home equity, and 1.43 percent and 1.80 percent for the total consumer portfolio for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013 , respectively. These are the only product classifications that include PCI and fully-insured loans for these periods. Net charge-offs exclude write-offs in the PCI loan portfolio of $196 million and $547 million in residential mortgage and $50 million and $250 million in home equity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 , respectively. Net charge-offs exclude write-offs in the PCI loan portfolio of $351 million and $648 million in residential mortgage and $92 million and $947 million in home equity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013 , respectively. These write-offs decreased the PCI valuation allowance included as part of the allowance for loan and lease losses. Net charge-off ratios including the PCI write-offs were 0.42 percent and 0.38 percent for residential mortgage and 0.63 percent and 1.30 percent for home equity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 , respectively. Net charge-off ratios including the PCI write-offs were 0.89 percent and 0.79 percent for residential mortgage and 1.59 percent and 3.17 percent for home equity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013 , respectively.

For more information on the fair value option, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Consumer Loans Accounted for Under the Fair Value Option on page 99 and Note 15 Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements . (2) Net charge-offs exclude write-offs in the PCI loan portfolios of $196 million and $547 million in residential mortgage and $50 million and $250 million in home equity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 , which are included in the Legacy Assets & Servicing portfolio, compared to $351 million and $648 million in residential mortgage and $92 million and $947 million in home equity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013 . Write-offs in the PCI loan portfolio decrease the PCI valuation allowance included as part of the allowance for loan and lease losses. For more information on PCI write-offs, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio on page 95 . 87 Table of Contents We believe that the presentation of information adjusted to exclude the impact of the PCI loan portfolio, the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option is more representative of the ongoing operations and credit quality of the business. As a result, in the following discussions of the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios, we provide information that excludes the impact of the PCI loan portfolio, the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option in certain credit quality statistics. We separately disclose information on the PCI loan portfolio on page 95 . Residential Mortgage The residential mortgage portfolio makes up the largest percentage of our consumer loan portfolio at 45 percent of consumer loans and leases at September 30, 2014 . Approximately 22 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio is in GWIM and represents residential mortgages that are originated for the home purchase and refinancing needs of our wealth management clients. The remaining portion of the portfolio is primarily in All Other and is comprised of originated loans, purchased loans used in our overall ALM activities, delinquent FHA loans repurchased pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA as well as loans repurchased related to our representations and warranties. Outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, decreased $23.3 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 due to paydowns, sales, charge-offs and transfers to foreclosed properties. These were partially offset by new origination volume retained on our balance sheet, as well as repurchases of delinquent loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA, which are part of our mortgage banking activities. At September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 , the residential mortgage portfolio included $72.0 billion and $87.2 billion of outstanding fully-insured loans. On this portion of the residential mortgage portfolio, we are protected against principal loss as a result of either FHA insurance or long-term standby agreements with FNMA and FHLMC. At September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 , $50.7 billion and $59.0 billion had FHA insurance with the remainder protected by long-term standby agreements. At September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 , $17.5 billion and $22.5 billion of the FHA-insured loan population were repurchases of delinquent FHA loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA. All of these loans are individually insured and therefore the Corporation does not record a significant allowance for credit losses with respect to these loans. The long-term standby agreements with FNMA and FHLMC reduce our regulatory risk-weighted assets due to the transfer of a portion of our credit risk to unaffiliated parties. At September 30, 2014 , these programs had the cumulative effect of reducing our risk-weighted assets by $6.4 billion, increasing both our Tier 1 capital ratio and common equity tier 1 capital ratio by six bps under the Basel 3 Standardized Transition. This compared to reducing our risk-weighted assets by $8.4 billion, increasing our Tier 1 capital ratio by eight bps and increasing our Tier 1 common capital ratio by seven bps at December 31, 2013 under Basel 1 (which included the Market Risk Final Rules). In addition to the long-term standby agreements with FNMA and FHLMC, we have mitigated a portion of our credit risk on the residential mortgage portfolio through the use of synthetic securitization vehicles as described in Note 4 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements . At September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 , the synthetic securitization vehicles referenced principal balances of $7.4 billion and $12.5 billion of residential mortgage loans and provided loss protection up to $293 million and $339 million . At September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 , the Corporation had a receivable of $155 million and $198 million from these vehicles for reimbursement of losses. The Corporation records an allowance for credit losses on loans referenced by the synthetic securitization vehicles. The reported net charge-offs for the residential mortgage portfolio do not include the benefit of amounts reimbursable from these vehicles. 88 Table of Contents Table 35 presents certain residential mortgage key credit statistics on both a reported basis excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, and excluding the PCI loan portfolio, our fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option. Additionally, in the "Reported Basis" columns in the table below, accruing balances past due and nonperforming loans do not include the PCI loan portfolio, in accordance with our accounting policies, even though the customer may be contractually past due. As such, the following discussion presents the residential mortgage portfolio excluding the PCI loan portfolio, the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option. For more information on the PCI loan portfolio, see page 95 .

There were $2.0 billion of residential mortgage loans accounted for under the fair value option at both September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . For more information on the fair value option, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Consumer Loans Accounted for Under the Fair Value Option on page 99 and Note 15 Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements . (2) These vintages of loans account for $4.0 billion, or 50 percent , and $6.2 billion, or 53 percent , of nonperforming residential mortgage loans at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . For the three months ended September 30, 2014 , these vintages accounted for $13 million, or 26 percent, of total residential mortgage net charge-offs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2014 , these vintages accounted for $0 of total residential mortgage net charge-offs. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013 , these vintages accounted for $133 million, or 60 percent , and $563 million, or 64 percent , of total residential mortgage net charge-offs. (3) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as annualized net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option. Nonperforming residential mortgage loans decreased $3.6 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 as sales of $2.8 billion, returns to performing status, paydowns, charge-offs, and transfers to foreclosed properties and held-for-sale outpaced new inflows. Of the nonperforming residential mortgage loans at September 30, 2014 , $2.5 billion, or 31 percent were current on contractual payments. Nonperforming loans that are contractually current primarily consist of collateral-dependent TDRs, including those that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, as well as loans that have not yet demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance. In addition, $4.3 billion, or 53 percent of nonperforming residential mortgage loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell. Accruing loans past due 30 days or more decreased $395 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 . Net charge-offs decreased $168 million to $53 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014 , or 0.15 percent of total average residential mortgage loans, compared to net charge-offs of $221 million , or 0.60 percent , for the same period in 2013 . Net charge-offs decreased $730 million to $145 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 , or 0.14 percent of total average residential mortgage loans, compared to $875 million , or 0.80 percent , for the same period in 2013 . These decreases in net charge-offs for the three- and nine-month periods were primarily driven by favorable portfolio trends and decreased write-downs on loans greater than 180 days past due, which were written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell, due in part to improvement in home prices and the U.S. economy. In addition, net charge-offs declined due to the impact of recoveries of $39 million and $224 million related to nonperforming loan sales during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 . 89 Table of Contents Residential mortgage loans with a greater than 90 percent but less than or equal to 100 percent refreshed loan-to-value (LTV) represented six percent and seven percent of the residential mortgage portfolio at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . Loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent represented seven percent and 10 percent of the residential mortgage loan portfolio at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . Of the loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent, 96 percent and 94 percent were performing at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . Loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent reflect loans where the outstanding carrying value of the loan is greater than the most recent valuation of the property securing the loan. The majority of these loans have a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent primarily due to home price deterioration since 2006, somewhat mitigated by appreciation. Loans to borrowers with refreshed FICO scores below 620 represented eight percent and 11 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . Of the $137.2 billion in total residential mortgage loans outstanding at September 30, 2014 , as shown in Table 36 , 39 percent were originated as interest-only loans. The outstanding balance of interest-only residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period was $13.7 billion, or 25 percent at September 30, 2014 . Residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period generally have experienced a higher rate of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status compared to the residential mortgage portfolio as a whole. At September 30, 2014 , $259 million, or two percent of outstanding interest-only residential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $2.0 billion , or one percent for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, at September 30, 2014 , $1.6 billion, or 12 percent of outstanding interest-only residential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming, of which $960 million were contractually current, compared to $8.1 billion , or six percent for the entire residential mortgage portfolio, of which $2.5 billion were contractually current. Loans in our interest-only residential mortgage portfolio have an interest-only period of three to ten years and more than 90 percent of these loans that have yet to enter the amortization period will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2016 or later. 90 Table of Contents Table 36 presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the residential mortgage portfolio. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) within California represented 13 percent of outstandings at both September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 , loans within this MSA contributed net recoveries of $10 million and $32 million within the residential mortgage portfolio. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013 , loans within this MSA contributed one percent and four percent of net charge-offs within the residential mortgage portfolio. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 11 percent and 10 percent of outstandings at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 , loans within this MSA contributed net charge-offs of $15 million and $44 million within the residential mortgage portfolio. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013 , loans within this MSA contributed 12 percent and nine percent of net charge-offs within the residential mortgage portfolio.

There were $2.0 billion of residential mortgage loans accounted for under the fair value option at both September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . For more information on the fair value option, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Consumer Loans Accounted for Under the Fair Value Option on page 99 and Note 15 Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements . (2) Net charge-offs exclude $196 million and $547 million of write-offs in the residential mortgage PCI loan portfolio for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $351 million and $648 million the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013 . These write-offs decreased the PCI valuation allowance included as part of the allowance for loan and lease losses. For more information on PCI write-offs, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio on page 95 . (3) In these states, foreclosure requires a court order following a legal proceeding (judicial states). (4) Amount excludes the PCI residential mortgage and fully-insured loan portfolios. The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) encourages banks to meet the credit needs of their communities for housing and other purposes, particularly in neighborhoods with low or moderate incomes. Our CRA portfolio was $9.1 billion and $10.3 billion at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 , or seven percent of the residential mortgage portfolio for both periods. The CRA portfolio included $925 million and $1.7 billion of nonperforming loans at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 , representing 11 percent and 14 percent of total nonperforming residential mortgage loans. Net charge-offs in the CRA portfolio were $24 million and $68 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013 , or 45 percent and 31 percent of total net charge-offs for the residential mortgage portfolio. Net charge-offs in the CRA portfolio were $45 million and $216 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013 , or 31 percent and 25 percent of total net charge-offs for the residential mortgage portfolio. Home Equity At September 30, 2014 , the home equity portfolio made up 18 percent of the consumer portfolio and is comprised of HELOCs, home equity loans and reverse mortgages. At September 30, 2014 , our HELOC portfolio had an outstanding balance of $75.5 billion, or 86 percent of the total home equity portfolio compared to $80.3 billion, or 86 percent, at December 31, 2013 . HELOCs generally have an initial draw period of 10 years. During the initial draw period, the borrowers are only required to pay the interest due on the loans on a monthly basis. After the initial draw period ends, the loans generally convert to 15-year amortizing loans. 91 Table of Contents At September 30, 2014 , our home equity loan portfolio had an outstanding balance of $10.3 billion , or 12 percent of the total home equity portfolio compared to $12.0 billion, or 13 percent, at December 31, 2013 . Home equity loans are almost all fixed-rate loans with amortizing payment terms of 10 to 30 years and of the $10.3 billion at September 30, 2014 , 52 percent have 25- to 30-year terms. At September 30, 2014 , our reverse mortgage portfolio had an outstanding balance, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, of $1.7 billion, or two percent of the total home equity portfolio compared to $1.4 billion, or one percent, at December 31, 2013 . We no longer originate these products. At September 30, 2014 , approximately 91 percent of the home equity portfolio was included in CRES while the remainder of the portfolio was primarily in GWIM . Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, decreased $6.2 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 primarily due to paydowns and charge-offs outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines. Of the total home equity portfolio at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 , $22.4 billion and $23.0 billion, or 26 percent and 25 percent, were in first-lien positions (27 percent and 26 percent excluding the PCI home equity portfolio). At September 30, 2014 , outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio that were in a second-lien or more junior-lien position and where we also held the first-lien loan totaled $16.0 billion, or 20 percent of our total home equity portfolio excluding the PCI loan portfolio. Unused HELOCs totaled $54.4 billion at September 30, 2014 compared to $56.8 billion at December 31, 2013 . The decrease was primarily due to customers choosing to close accounts and customer paydowns of principal balances, which more than offset the impact of new production. The HELOC utilization rate was 58 percent at September 30, 2014 compared to 59 percent at December 31, 2013 . Table 37 presents certain home equity portfolio key credit statistics on both a reported basis excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, and excluding the PCI loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option. Additionally, in the "Reported Basis" columns in the table below, accruing balances past due 30 days or more and nonperforming loans do not include the PCI loan portfolio, in accordance with our accounting policies, even though the customer may be contractually past due. As such, the following discussion presents the home equity portfolio excluding the PCI loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option. For more information on the PCI loan portfolio, see page 95 .

There were $179 million and $147 million of home equity loans accounted for under the fair value option at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . For more information on the fair value option, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Consumer Loans Accounted for Under the Fair Value Option on page 99 and Note 15 Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements . (2) Accruing past due 30 days or more includes $103 million and $131 million and nonperforming loans includes $545 million and $582 million of loans where we serviced the underlying first-lien at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . (3) These vintages of loans have higher refreshed combined LTV ratios and accounted for 49 percent and 50 percent of nonperforming home equity loans at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 , and 59 percent and 57 percent of net charge-offs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 67 percent and 62 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013 . (4) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as annualized net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option. 92 Table of Contents Nonperforming outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased $49 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 primarily due to enhanced identification of the delinquency status on first-lien loans serviced by other financial institutions. This was partially offset by an increase in contractually current nonperforming loans where the loan has been modified in a TDR. Of the nonperforming home equity portfolio at September 30, 2014 , $1.9 billion, or 47 percent were current on contractual payments. Nonperforming loans that are contractually current primarily consist of collateral-dependent TDRs, including those that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, junior-lien loans where the underlying first is 90 days or more past due, as well as loans that have not yet demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance. In addition, $1.4 billion, or 36 percent of nonperforming home equity loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell. Outstanding balances accruing past due 30 days or more decreased $299 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 . In some cases, the junior-lien home equity outstanding balance that we hold is performing, but the underlying first-lien is not. For outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio on which we service the first-lien loan, we are able to track whether the first-lien loan is in default. For loans where the first-lien is serviced by a third party, we utilize credit bureau data to estimate the delinquency status of the first-lien. Given that the credit bureau database we use does not include a property address for the mortgages, we are unable to identify with certainty whether a reported delinquent first-lien mortgage pertains to the same property for which we hold a junior-lien loan. Beginning in the third quarter of 2014, we now utilize a third-party vendor to combine credit bureau and public record data to better link a junior-lien loan with the underlying first-lien mortgage. At September 30, 2014 , we estimate that $1.7 billion of current and $215 million of 30 to 89 days past due junior-lien loans were behind a delinquent first-lien loan. We service the first-lien loans on $342 million of these combined amounts, with the remaining $1.6 billion serviced by third parties. Of the $1.9 billion of current to 89 days past due junior-lien loans, based on available credit bureau data and our own internal servicing data, we estimate that approximately $981 million had first-lien loans that were 90 days or more past due. Net charge-offs decreased $213 million to $89 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014 , or 0.43 percent of the total average home equity portfolio, compared to $302 million , or 1.31 percent for the same period in 2013 . Net charge-offs decreased $842 million to $630 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 , or 1.00 percent of the total average home equity portfolio, compared to $1.5 billion , or 2.09 percent for the same period in 2013 . These decreases in net charge-offs for the three- and nine-month periods were primarily driven by favorable portfolio trends due in part to improvement in home prices and the U.S. economy. The net charge-off ratios were also impacted by lower outstanding balances primarily as a result of paydowns and charge-offs outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines. Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio with greater than 90 percent but less than or equal to 100 percent refreshed combined loan-to-value (CLTVs) comprised eight percent and nine percent of the home equity portfolio at both September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . Outstanding balances with refreshed CLTVs greater than 100 percent comprised 15 percent and 19 percent of the home equity portfolio at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent reflect loans where the carrying value and available line of credit of the combined loans are equal to or greater than the most recent valuation of the property securing the loan. Depending on the value of the property, there may be collateral in excess of the first-lien that is available to reduce the severity of loss on the second-lien. Home price deterioration since 2006, partially mitigated by appreciation, has contributed to an increase in CLTV ratios. Of those outstanding balances with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent, 95 percent of the customers were current on their home equity loan and 92 percent of second-lien loans with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent were current on both their second-lien and underlying first-lien loans at September 30, 2014 . Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio to borrowers with a refreshed FICO score below 620 represented seven percent and eight percent of the home equity portfolio at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . Of the $81.7 billion in total home equity portfolio outstandings at September 30, 2014 , as shown in Table 38 , 76 percent were interest-only loans, almost all of which were HELOCs. The outstanding balance of HELOCs that have entered the amortization period was $4.2 billion, or six percent of total HELOCs at September 30, 2014 . The HELOCs that have entered the amortization period have experienced a higher percentage of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status when compared to the HELOC portfolio as a whole. At September 30, 2014 , $111 million, or three percent of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $540 million, or one percent for the entire HELOC portfolio. In addition, at September 30, 2014 , $672 million, or 16 percent of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming, of which $312 million were contractually current, compared to $3.6 billion, or five percent for the entire HELOC portfolio, of which $1.6 billion were contractually current. Loans in our HELOC portfolio generally have an initial draw period of 10 years and more than 75 percent of these loans that have yet to enter the amortization period will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2016 or later. We communicate to contractually current customers more than a year prior to the end of their draw period to inform them of the potential change to the payment structure before entering the amortization period, and provide payment options to customers prior to the end of the draw period. 93 Table of Contents Although we do not actively track how many of our home equity customers pay only the minimum amount due on their home equity loans and lines, we can infer some of this information through a review of our HELOC portfolio that we service and that is still in its revolving period (i.e., customers may draw on and repay their line of credit, but are generally only required to pay interest on a monthly basis). During the three months ended September 30, 2014 , approximately 54 percent of these customers with an outstanding balance did not pay any principal on their HELOCs. Table 38 presents outstandings, nonperforming balances and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the home equity portfolio. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 12 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 , loans within this MSA contributed net charge-offs of $16 million and $87 million of total net charge-offs, and seven percent and nine percent of net charge-offs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013 within the home equity portfolio. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California made up 12 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 , loans within this MSA contributed net recoveries of $10 million and net charge-offs of $21 million within the home equity portfolio. For three and nine months ended September 30, 2013 , loans within this MSA contributed eight percent and nine percent of net charge-offs within the home equity portfolio.

For more information on the fair value option, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Consumer Loans Accounted for Under the Fair Value Option on page 99 and Note 15 Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements . (2) Net charge-offs exclude $50 million and $250 million of write-offs in the home equity PCI loan portfolio for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $92 million and $947 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013 . These write-offs decreased the PCI valuation allowance included as part of the allowance for loan and lease losses. For more information on PCI write-offs, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio on page 95 . (3) In these states, foreclosure requires a court order following a legal proceeding (judicial states). (4) Amount excludes the PCI home equity portfolio. 94 Table of Contents Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio Loans acquired with evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination and for which it is probable at purchase that we will be unable to collect all contractually required payments are accounted for under the accounting guidance for PCI loans, which addresses accounting for differences between contractual and expected cash flows to be collected from the purchaser's initial investment in loans if those differences are attributable, at least in part, to credit quality. Evidence of credit quality deterioration as of the acquisition date may include statistics such as past due status, refreshed FICO scores and refreshed LTVs. PCI loans are recorded at fair value upon acquisition and the applicable accounting guidance prohibits carrying over or recording a valuation allowance in the initial accounting. PCI loans that have similar risk characteristics, primarily credit risk, collateral type and interest rate risk, are pooled and accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows. Once a pool is assembled, it is treated as if it were one loan for purposes of applying the accounting guidance for PCI loans. An individual loan is removed from a PCI loan pool if it is sold, foreclosed, forgiven or the expectation of any future proceeds is remote. When a loan is removed from a PCI loan pool and the foreclosure or recovery value of the loan is less than the loan's carrying value, the difference is first applied against the PCI pool's nonaccretable difference. If the nonaccretable difference has been fully utilized, only then is the PCI pool's basis applicable to that loan written-off against its valuation reserve; however, the integrity of the pool is maintained and it continues to be accounted for as if it were one loan. Table 39 presents the unpaid principal balance, carrying value, related valuation allowance and the net carrying value as a percentage of the unpaid principal balance for the PCI loan portfolio.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2014 , we sold PCI loans with a carrying value of $1.9 billion compared to sales of $406 million for the same period in 2013. Of the unpaid principal balance of $22.0 billion at September 30, 2014 , $2.4 billion was 180 days or more past due, including $2.3 billion of first-lien mortgages and $92 million of home equity loans. Of the $19.6 billion that was less than 180 days past due, $17.4 billion, or 89 percent of the total unpaid principal balance was current based on the contractual terms while $1.6 billion, or eight percent, was in early stage delinquency. During the three months ended September 30, 2014 , we recorded no provision expense for the PCI loan portfolio. This compared to a total provision benefit of $248 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013 . During the nine months ended September 30, 2014 , we recorded a provision benefit of $106 million for the PCI loan portfolio including a benefit of $126 million for residential mortgage and a provision expense of $20 million for home equity. This compared to a total provision benefit of $707 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 . The provision benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 was primarily driven by changes in liquidation assumptions and improved macro-economic conditions. The PCI valuation allowance declined $903 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 due to write-offs in the PCI loan portfolio of $547 million in residential mortgage and $250 million in home equity, and a provision benefit of $106 million for the PCI loan portfolio. 95 Table of Contents Purchased Credit-impaired Residential Mortgage Loan Portfolio The PCI residential mortgage loan portfolio represented 73 percent of the total PCI loan portfolio at September 30, 2014 . Those loans to borrowers with a refreshed FICO score below 620 represented 42 percent of the PCI residential mortgage loan portfolio at September 30, 2014 . Loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 90 percent, after consideration of purchase accounting adjustments and the related valuation allowance, represented 31 percent of the PCI residential mortgage loan portfolio and 40 percent based on the unpaid principal balance at September 30, 2014 . Table 40 presents outstandings net of purchase accounting adjustments and before the related valuation allowance, by certain state concentrations. Table 40 Outstanding Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio Residential Mortgage State Concentrations (Dollars in millions) September 30 2014 December 31 2013 California $ 7,064 $ 8,180 Florida (1) 1,346 1,750 Virginia 656 760 Maryland 620 728 Texas 327 433 Other U.S./Non-U.S. 5,575 6,821 Total $ 15,588 $ 18,672 (1) In this state, foreclosure requires a court order following a legal proceeding (judicial state). Pay option adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which are included in the PCI residential mortgage portfolio, have interest rates that adjust monthly and minimum required payments that adjust annually, subject to resetting if minimum payments are made and deferred interest limits are reached. Annual payment adjustments are subject to a 7.5 percent maximum change. To ensure that contractual loan payments are adequate to repay a loan, the fully-amortizing loan payment amount is re-established after the initial five- or ten-year period and again every five years thereafter. These payment adjustments are not subject to the 7.5 percent limit and may be substantial due to changes in interest rates and the addition of unpaid interest to the loan balance. Payment advantage ARMs have interest rates that are fixed for an initial period of five years. Payments are subject to reset if the minimum payments are made and deferred interest limits are reached. If interest deferrals cause a loan's principal balance to reach a certain level within the first 10 years of the life of the loan, the payment is reset to the interest-only payment; then at the 10-year point, the fully-amortizing payment is required. The difference between the frequency of changes in a loan's interest rates and payments along with a limitation on changes in the minimum monthly payments of 7.5 percent per year can result in payments that are not sufficient to pay all of the monthly interest charges (i.e., negative amortization). Unpaid interest is added to the loan balance until the loan balance increases to a specified limit, which can be no more than 115 percent of the original loan amount, at which time a new monthly payment amount adequate to repay the loan over its remaining contractual life is established. At September 30, 2014 , the unpaid principal balance of pay option loans, which include pay option ARMs and payment advantage ARMs, was $3.5 billion, with a carrying value of $3.3 billion, including $2.9 billion of loans that were credit-impaired upon acquisition and, accordingly, the reserve is based on a life-of-loan loss estimate. The total unpaid principal balance of pay option loans with accumulated negative amortization was $1.2 billion, including $71 million of negative amortization. For those borrowers who are making payments in accordance with their contractual terms, two percent and five percent at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 elected to make only the minimum payment on pay option loans. We believe the majority of borrowers are now making scheduled payments primarily because the low rate environment has caused the fully indexed rates to be affordable to more borrowers. We continue to evaluate our exposure to payment resets on the acquired negative-amortizing loans including the PCI pay option loan portfolio and have taken into consideration in the evaluation several assumptions including prepayment and default rates. Of the loans in the pay option portfolio at September 30, 2014 that have not already experienced a payment reset, less than two percent are expected to reset before 2016, 31 percent are expected to reset in 2016 and 10 percent are expected to reset thereafter. In addition, 18 percent are expected to prepay and approximately 39 percent are expected to default prior to being reset, most of which were severely delinquent as of September 30, 2014 . 96 Table of Contents Purchased Credit-impaired Home Equity Loan Portfolio The PCI home equity portfolio represented 27 percent of the total PCI loan portfolio at September 30, 2014 . Those loans with a refreshed FICO score below 620 represented 16 percent of the PCI home equity portfolio at September 30, 2014 . Loans with a refreshed CLTV greater than 90 percent, after consideration of purchase accounting adjustments and the related valuation allowance, represented 61 percent of the PCI home equity portfolio and 65 percent based on the unpaid principal balance at September 30, 2014 .

U.S. Credit Card At September 30, 2014 , 96 percent of the U.S. credit card portfolio was managed in CBB with the remainder managed in GWIM . Outstandings in the U.S. credit card portfolio decreased $3.3 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 due to a seasonal decline in retail transaction volume and a portfolio divestiture. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 , net charge-offs decreased $163 million to $625 million and $626 million to $2.0 billion compared to the same periods in 2013 due to improvements in delinquencies and bankruptcies as a result of an improved economic environment and the impact of higher credit quality originations. U.S. credit card loans 30 days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased $371 million while loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased $222 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 as a result of the factors mentioned above that contributed to lower net charge-offs. Table 42 presents certain key credit statistics for the U.S. credit card portfolio.

Unused lines of credit for U.S. credit card totaled $310.1 billion and $315.1 billion at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . The $5.0 billion decrease was driven by the closure of inactive accounts and a portfolio divestiture. 97 Table of Contents Table 43 presents certain state concentrations for the U.S. credit card portfolio.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 , net charge-offs decreased $22 million to $67 million and $115 million to $190 million compared to the same periods in 2013 due to improvement in delinquencies as a result of higher credit quality originations and an improved economic environment, as well as improved recovery rates on previously charged-off loans, which were partially offset by strengthening of the British Pound against the U.S. Dollar. Unused lines of credit for non-U.S. credit card totaled $30.0 billion and $31.1 billion at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . The $1.1 billion decrease was primarily driven by weakening of the British Pound against the U.S. Dollar. Table 44 presents certain key credit statistics for the non-U.S. credit card portfolio.

Outstandings in the direct/indirect portfolio increased $926 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 as growth in the securities-based lending portfolio was partially offset by lower outstandings in the unsecured consumer lending portfolio and the consumer dealer financial services portfolio. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 , net charge-offs decreased $28 million to $34 million , and $147 million to $125 million , or 0.17 percent and 0.20 percent of total average direct/indirect loans, compared to 0.30 percent and 0.44 percent for the same periods in 2013 . These decreases in net charge-offs were primarily driven by improvements in delinquencies and bankruptcies in the unsecured consumer lending portfolio as a result of an improved economic environment as well as reduced outstandings in this portfolio. Net charge-offs in the unsecured consumer lending portfolio decreased $28 million to $9 million, and $119 million to $42 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 , or 1.79 percent and 2.57 percent of total average unsecured consumer lending loans compared to 4.48 percent and 5.58 percent for the same periods in 2013 . Direct/indirect loans that were past due 30 days or more and still accruing interest declined $215 million to $798 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 due to improvements in the dealer financial services, student lending and unsecured consumer lending portfolios. Table 45 presents certain state concentrations for the direct/indirect consumer loan portfolio.

The remainder is primarily leases within the consumer dealer financial services portfolio included in CBB . Consumer Loans Accounted for Under the Fair Value Option Outstanding consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option totaled $2.1 billion at September 30, 2014 and were comprised of residential mortgage loans that were previously classified as held-for-sale, residential mortgage loans held in consolidated VIEs and repurchased home equity loans. The loans that were previously classified as held-for-sale were transferred to the residential mortgage portfolio in connection with the decision to retain the loans. The fair value option had been elected at the time of origination and the loans continue to be measured at fair value after the reclassification. During the nine months ended September 30, 2014 , we recorded net gains of $14 million resulting from changes in the fair value of these loans, including losses of $22 million on loans held in consolidated VIEs that were offset by gains recorded on related long-term debt. 99 Table of Contents Nonperforming Consumer Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity Table 46 presents nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013 . Nonperforming LHFS are excluded from nonperforming loans as they are recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value. Nonperforming loans do not include past due consumer credit card loans, other unsecured loans and in general, consumer non-real estate-secured loans (loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy are included) as these loans are typically charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due. The charge-offs on these loans have no impact on nonperforming activity and, accordingly, are excluded from this table. The fully-insured loan portfolio is not reported as nonperforming as principal repayment is insured. Additionally, nonperforming loans do not include the PCI loan portfolio or loans accounted for under the fair value option. For more information on nonperforming loans, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Nonperforming loans of $12.2 billion at September 30, 2014 declined $3.7 billion compared to December 31, 2013 as outflows including the impact of loan sales and transfers to held-for-sale outpaced new inflows which continued to improve due to favorable delinquency trends. The outstanding balance of a real estate-secured loan that is in excess of the estimated property value less costs to sell is charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due unless repayment of the loan is fully insured. At September 30, 2014 , $6.3 billion, or 50 percent of nonperforming consumer real estate loans and foreclosed properties had been written down to their estimated property value less costs to sell, including $5.7 billion of nonperforming loans 180 days or more past due and $614 million of foreclosed properties. In addition, at September 30, 2014 , $4.4 billion, or 36 percent of nonperforming consumer loans were modified and are now current after successful trial periods, or are current loans classified as nonperforming loans in accordance with applicable policies. Foreclosed properties of $614 million at September 30, 2014 increased $81 million compared to December 31, 2013 as additions outpaced liquidations. PCI loans are excluded from nonperforming loans as these loans were written down to fair value at the acquisition date; however, once the underlying real estate is acquired by the Corporation upon foreclosure of the delinquent PCI loan, it is included in foreclosed properties. PCI-related foreclosed properties increased $68 million and $144 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 . Not included in foreclosed properties at September 30, 2014 was $1.1 billion of real estate that was acquired upon foreclosure of delinquent FHA-insured loans. We exclude these amounts from our nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties activity as we expect we will be reimbursed once the property is conveyed to the FHA for principal and, up to certain limits, costs incurred during the foreclosure process and interest incurred during the holding period. For more information on the review of our foreclosure processes, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Servicing, Foreclosure and Other Mortgage Matters on page 60 . Restructured Loans Nonperforming loans also include certain loans that have been modified in TDRs where economic concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. These concessions typically result from the Corporation's loss mitigation activities and could include reductions in the interest rate, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance or other actions. Certain TDRs are classified as nonperforming at the time of restructuring and may only be returned to performing status after considering the borrower's sustained repayment performance for a reasonable period, generally six months. Nonperforming TDRs, excluding those modified loans in the PCI loan portfolio, are included in Table 46 . 100 Table of Contents Table 46 Nonperforming Consumer Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity (1) Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 (Dollars in millions) 2014 2013 2014 2013 Nonperforming loans and leases, beginning of period $ 13,460 $ 18,540 $ 15,840 $ 19,431 Additions to nonperforming loans and leases: New nonperforming loans and leases 1,516 2,503 5,368 7,453 Reductions to nonperforming loans and leases: Paydowns and payoffs (522 ) (544 ) (1,315 ) (1,919 ) Sales (957 ) (624 ) (2,782 ) (799 ) Returns to performing status (2) (810 ) (1,079 ) (2,549 ) (3,161 ) Charge-offs (431 ) (758 ) (1,654 ) (2,762 ) Transfers to foreclosed properties (3) (183 ) (131 ) (512 ) (336 ) Transfers (to) from loans held-for-sale 115 (326 ) (208 ) (326 ) Total net reductions to nonperforming loans and leases (1,272 ) (959 ) (3,652 ) (1,850 ) Total nonperforming loans and leases, September 30 (4) 12,188 17,581 12,188 17,581 Foreclosed properties, beginning of period 547 508 533 650 Additions to foreclosed properties: New foreclosed properties (3) 340 303 773 690 Reductions to foreclosed properties: Sales (248 ) (230 ) (629 ) (714 ) Write-downs (25 ) (35 ) (63 ) (80 ) Total net additions (reductions) to foreclosed properties 67 38 81 (104 ) Total foreclosed properties, September 30 (5) 614 546 614 546 Nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties, September 30 $ 12,802 $ 18,127 $ 12,802 $ 18,127 Nonperforming consumer loans and leases as a percentage of outstanding consumer loans and leases (6) 2.45 % 3.27 % Nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties as a percentage of outstanding consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties (6) 2.57 3.37 (1) Balances do not include nonperforming LHFS of $9 million and $697 million and nonaccruing TDRs removed from the PCI loan portfolio prior to January 1, 2010 of $101 million and $356 million at September 30, 2014 and 2013 as well as loans accruing past due 90 days or more as presented in Table 32 and Note 4 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements . (2) Consumer loans may be returned to performing status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected, or when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection. (3) New foreclosed properties represents transfers of nonperforming loans to foreclosed properties net of charge-offs taken during the first 90 days after transfer of a loan to foreclosed properties. New foreclosed properties also includes properties obtained upon foreclosure of delinquent PCI loans, properties repurchased due to representations and warranties exposure and properties acquired with newly consolidated subsidiaries. (4) At September 30, 2014 , 47 percent of nonperforming loans were 180 days or more past due and were written down through charge-offs to 65 percent of their unpaid principal balance. (5) Foreclosed property balances do not include loans that are insured by the FHA and have entered foreclosure of $1.1 billion and $1.6 billion at September 30, 2014 and 2013 . (6) Outstanding consumer loans and leases exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. Our policy is to record any losses in the value of foreclosed properties as a reduction in the allowance for loan and lease losses during the first 90 days after transfer of a loan to foreclosed properties. Thereafter, further losses in value as well as gains and losses on sale are recorded in noninterest expense. New foreclosed properties included in Table 46 are net of $65 million and $150 million of charge-offs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $45 million and $133 million for the same periods in 2013 , recorded during the first 90 days after transfer. We classify junior-lien home equity loans as nonperforming when the first-lien loan becomes 90 days past due even if the junior-lien loan is performing. At September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 , $981 million and $1.2 billion of such junior-lien home equity loans were included in nonperforming loans and leases. This decline was driven by enhanced identification of the delinquency on first-lien loans serviced by other financial institutions. 101 Table of Contents Table 47 presents TDRs for the home loans portfolio. Performing TDR balances are excluded from nonperforming loans and leases in Table 46 .

(2) Residential mortgage performing TDRs included $12.0 billion and $14.3 billion of loans that were fully-insured at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . (3) Home equity TDRs deemed collateral dependent totaled $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion , and included $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion of loans classified as nonperforming and $190 million and $227 million of loans classified as performing at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . In addition to modifying home loans, we work with customers who are experiencing financial difficulty by modifying credit card and other consumer loans. Credit card and other consumer loan modifications generally involve a reduction in the consumer's interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months, all of which are considered TDRs (the renegotiated TDR portfolio). In addition, the accounts of non-U.S. credit card customers who do not qualify for a fixed payment plan may have their interest rates reduced, as required by certain local jurisdictions. These modifications, which are also TDRs, tend to experience higher payment default rates given that the borrowers may lack the ability to repay even with the interest rate reduction. In all cases, the customer's available line of credit is canceled. Modifications of credit card and other consumer loans are primarily made through internal renegotiation programs utilizing direct customer contact, but may also utilize external renegotiation programs. The renegotiated TDR portfolio is excluded in large part from Table 46 as substantially all of the loans remain on accrual status until either charged off or paid in full. At September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 , our renegotiated TDR portfolio was $1.4 billion and $2.1 billion , of which $1.1 billion and $1.6 billion were current or less than 30 days past due under the modified terms. The decline in the renegotiated TDR portfolio was primarily driven by paydowns and charge-offs as well as lower program enrollments. For more information on the renegotiated TDR portfolio, see Note 4 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements . 102 Table of Contents Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Commercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal that concentrations of credit exposure do not result in undesirable levels of risk. We review, measure and manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, customer relationship and loan size. We also review, measure and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property type. In addition, within our non-U.S. portfolio, we evaluate exposures by region and by country. Tables 52 , 57 and 63 summarize our concentrations. We also utilize syndications of exposure to third parties, loan sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio. For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status and net charge-offs for the commercial portfolio, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Commercial Credit Portfolio During the nine months ended September 30, 2014 , outstanding commercial loans and leases decreased $5.1 billion , primarily in Non-U.S. commercial. Credit quality was stable with declines in reservable criticized balances and small increases in nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed property balances during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 . Nonperforming commercial loans and leases as a percentage of outstanding commercial loans and leases increased slightly during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to 0.35 percent from 0.33 percent ( 0.35 percent from 0.34 percent excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option) at December 31, 2013 . The allowance for loan and lease losses for the commercial portfolio increased $427 million to $4.4 billion at September 30, 2014 compared to December 31, 2013 . For additional information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 117 .

Table 50 presents commercial credit exposure by type for utilized, unfunded and total binding committed credit exposure. Commercial utilized credit exposure includes standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and financial guarantees, bankers' acceptances and commercial letters of credit for which we are legally bound to advance funds under prescribed conditions, during a specified time period. Although funds have not yet been advanced, these exposure types are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes. Total commercial utilized credit exposure decreased $6.9 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 primarily driven by loans and leases, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees, and loans-held-for-sale, partially offset by an increase in derivative assets. The utilization rate for loans and leases, SBLCs and financial guarantees, commercial letters of credit and bankers' acceptances, in the aggregate, was 58 percent at both September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 .

(4) Derivative assets are carried at fair value, reflect the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and have been reduced by cash collateral of $45.4 billion and $47.3 billion at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . Not reflected in utilized and committed exposure is additional derivative collateral held of $20.7 billion and $17.1 billion which consists primarily of other marketable securities. 104 Table of Contents Table 51 presents commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure by product type. Criticized exposure corresponds to the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful asset categories as defined by regulatory authorities. Total commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure decreased $1.1 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 throughout most of the commercial portfolio driven largely by paydowns, upgrades and charge-offs outpacing downgrades. Approximately 86 percent of commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure was secured at both September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 .

(2) Percentages are calculated as commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure divided by total commercial utilized reservable exposure for each exposure category. U.S. Commercial At September 30, 2014 , 62 percent of the U.S. commercial loan portfolio, excluding small business, was managed in Global Banking, 17 percent in Global Markets , 10 percent in GWIM (generally business purpose loans for high net worth clients) and the remainder primarily in CBB . U.S. commercial loans, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, increased $2.9 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 with growth primarily from middle-market clients. Nonperforming loans and leases decreased $62 million , or eight percent , during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 . Net charge-offs decreased $10 million and $87 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in 2013 . Commercial Real Estate Commercial real estate primarily includes commercial loans and leases secured by non-owner-occupied real estate and is dependent on the sale or lease of the real estate as the primary source of repayment. The portfolio remains diversified across property types and geographic regions. California represented the largest state concentration at 21 percent and 22 percent of the commercial real estate loans and leases portfolio at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . The commercial real estate portfolio is predominantly managed in Global Banking and consists of loans made primarily to public and private developers, and commercial real estate firms. Outstanding loans decreased $870 million , or two percent , during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 primarily due to payoffs and portfolio sales. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 , we continued to see improvements in credit quality in both the residential and non-residential portfolios. We use a number of proactive risk mitigation initiatives to reduce adversely rated exposure in the commercial real estate portfolio including transfers of deteriorating exposures to management by independent special asset officers and pursuit of loan restructurings or asset sales to achieve the best results for our customers and the Corporation. Nonperforming commercial real estate loans and foreclosed properties increased $111 million , or 27 percent , while reservable criticized balances decreased $450 million , or 31 percent , during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 . Net charge-offs decreased $17 million to a net recovery of $6 million , and $223 million to a net recovery of $75 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in 2013 . 105 Table of Contents Table 52 presents outstanding commercial real estate loans by geographic region, based on the geographic location of the collateral, and by property type.

At September 30, 2014 , total committed non-residential exposure was $63.6 billion compared to $68.6 billion at December 31, 2013 , of which $45.2 billion and $46.4 billion were funded secured loans. Non-residential nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties increased $172 million , or 55 percent , to $482 million at September 30, 2014 compared to $310 million at December 31, 2013 , which represented 1.06 percent and 0.67 percent of total non-residential loans and foreclosed properties. The increase in nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties in the non-residential portfolio was primarily in the office property type. Non-residential utilized reservable criticized exposure decreased $367 million , or 28 percent , to $957 million at September 30, 2014 compared to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2013 , which represented 2.05 percent and 2.75 percent of non-residential utilized reservable exposure. For the non-residential portfolio, net charge-offs decreased $26 million to a net recovery of $19 million , and $174 million to a net recovery of $73 million for the three 107 Table of Contents and nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in 2013 primarily due to lower levels of criticized exposure as well as increased recoveries. At September 30, 2014 , total committed residential exposure was $3.5 billion compared to $3.1 billion at December 31, 2013 , of which $1.8 billion and $1.5 billion were funded secured loans at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013. Residential nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties decreased $61 million , or 60 percent , during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 due to repayments, sales and loan restructurings. Residential utilized reservable criticized exposure decreased $83 million , or 65 percent , during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 due to continued resolution of criticized exposure. The nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties and the utilized reservable criticized ratios for the residential portfolio were 2.26 percent and 2.36 percent at September 30, 2014 compared to 6.65 percent and 7.81 percent at December 31, 2013 . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 , residential portfolio net charge-offs increased $9 million to $13 million and decreased $49 million to a net recovery of $2 million compared to the same periods in 2013 . At September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 , the commercial real estate loan portfolio included $6.6 billion and $7.0 billion of funded construction and land development loans that were originated to fund the construction and/or rehabilitation of commercial properties. Reservable criticized construction and land development loans totaled $214 million and $431 million, and nonperforming construction and land development loans and foreclosed properties totaled $99 million and $100 million at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . During a property's construction phase, interest income is typically paid from interest reserves that are established at the inception of the loan. As construction is completed and the property is put into service, these interest reserves are depleted and interest payments from operating cash flows begin. We do not recognize interest income on nonperforming loans regardless of the existence of an interest reserve. Non-U.S. Commercial At September 30, 2014 , 75 percent of the non-U.S. commercial loan portfolio was managed in Global Banking and 25 percent in Global Markets . Outstanding loans, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, decreased $4.8 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 primarily due to decreased client financing activity (prime brokerage loans). Net charge-offs were $1 million and $32 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to net recoveries of $2 million and $1 million for the same periods in 2013 . For more information on the non-U.S. commercial portfolio, see Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 114 . U.S. Small Business Commercial The U.S. small business commercial loan portfolio is comprised of small business card loans and small business loans managed in CBB . Credit card-related products were 43 percent of the U.S. small business commercial portfolio at both September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . Net charge-offs were $69 million and $211 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $91 million and $291 million for the same periods in 2013 . The decrease was driven by an improvement in credit quality, including lower delinquencies as a result of an improved economic environment, and the impact of higher credit quality originations. Of the U.S. small business commercial net charge-offs, 75 percent and 74 percent were credit card-related products for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to 68 percent and 72 percent for the same periods in 2013 . Commercial Loans Accounted for Under the Fair Value Option The portfolio of commercial loans accounted for under the fair value option is held in Global Markets and Global Banking . Outstanding commercial loans accounted for under the fair value option decreased $1.8 billion to an aggregate fair value of $6.1 billion at September 30, 2014 compared to December 31, 2013 primarily due to decreased corporate borrowings under bank credit facilities. We recorded net losses of $9 million and net gains of $26 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to net gains of $8 million and $54 million for the same periods in 2013 from changes in the fair value of this loan portfolio. These amounts were primarily attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk, were recorded in other income and do not reflect the results of hedging activities. In addition, unfunded lending commitments and letters of credit accounted for under the fair value option had an aggregate fair value of $322 million and $354 million at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 , which was recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The associated aggregate notional amount of unfunded lending commitments and letters of credit accounted for under the fair value option was $9.0 billion and $13.0 billion at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . We recorded net gains of $6 million and $20 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to net gains of $76 million and $122 million for the same periods in 2013 from changes in the fair value of commitments and letters of credit. These amounts were primarily attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk, were recorded in other income and do not reflect the results of hedging activities. 108 Table of Contents Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity Table 55 presents the nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013 . Nonperforming loans do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 , nonperforming commercial loans and leases increased $136 million and $43 million to $1.4 billion driven by new nonperforming loans outpacing paydowns, charge-offs and returns to performing status. Approximately 97 percent of commercial nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties were secured and approximately 49 percent were contractually current. Commercial nonperforming loans were carried at approximately 82 percent of their unpaid principal balance before consideration of the allowance for loan and lease losses as the carrying value of these loans has been reduced to the estimated property value less costs to sell.

(2) Includes U.S. small business commercial activity. Small business card loans are excluded as they are not classified as nonperforming. (3) Commercial loans and leases may be returned to performing status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected, or when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection. TDRs are generally classified as performing after a sustained period of demonstrated payment performance. (4) New foreclosed properties represents transfers of nonperforming loans to foreclosed properties net of charge-offs recorded during the first 90 days after transfer of a loan to foreclosed properties. (5) Outstanding commercial loans exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. 109 Table of Contents Table 56 presents our commercial TDRs by product type and performing status. U.S. small business commercial TDRs are comprised of renegotiated small business card loans and are not classified as nonperforming as they are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due. For more information on TDRs, see Note 4 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements .

Our commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. Total commercial committed credit exposure of $824.0 billion remained relatively unchanged at September 30, 2014 compared to December 31, 2013 . Increases in commercial committed exposure for healthcare equipment and services, and food beverage and tobacco were offset by decreases in diversified financials and real estate. Industry limits are used internally to manage industry concentrations and are based on committed exposures and capital usage that are allocated on an industry-by-industry basis. A risk management framework is in place to set and approve industry limits as well as to provide ongoing monitoring. Management's Credit Risk Committee (CRC) oversees industry limit governance. Diversified financials, our largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $113.0 billion , decreased $5.1 billion , or four percent , during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 . The decline primarily reflected lower margin loans and consumer finance exposure. Real estate, our second-largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $70.7 billion , decreased $5.7 billion , or seven percent , during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 . The decrease was largely driven by portfolio sales, and a combination of prepayments and paydowns due to favorable market liquidity, and lower levels of originations. Real estate construction and land development exposure represented 13 percent and 14 percent of the total real estate industry committed exposure at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . For more information on commercial real estate and related portfolios, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Commercial Real Estate on page 105 . The following changes in our industry concentrations occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 . Committed exposure to the healthcare equipment and services industry increased $6.8 billion, or 14 percent, primarily driven by bridge financing for acquisitions. Food, beverage and tobacco committed exposure increased $3.4 billion, or 11 percent, primarily reflecting bridge financing in the beverage sector. Telecommunications services committed exposure decreased $2.4 billion, or 21 percent, primarily reflecting broadly distributed commitment reductions and paydowns. Retailing industry committed exposure increased $1.7 billion, or three percent, driven by higher exposure to diversified wholesalers and internet retail. Our committed state and municipal exposure of $37.7 billion at September 30, 2014 consisted of $31.5 billion of commercial utilized exposure (including $19.6 billion of funded loans, $6.5 billion of SBLCs and $2.1 billion of derivative assets) and $6.2 billion of unfunded commercial exposure (primarily unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit) and is reported in the government and public education industry in Table 57 . With the economy gradually strengthening, most state and local governments are experiencing improved fiscal circumstances and continue to honor debt obligations as agreed. While historical default rates have been low, as part of our overall and ongoing risk management processes, we continually monitor these exposures through a rigorous review process. Additionally, internal communications are regularly circulated such that exposure levels are maintained in compliance with established concentration guidelines. 110 Table of Contents Table 57 Commercial Credit Exposure by Industry (1) Commercial Utilized Total Commercial Committed (Dollars in millions) September 30 2014 December 31 2013 September 30 2014 December 31 2013 Diversified financials $ 68,739 $ 76,673 $ 112,957 $ 118,092 Real estate (2) 51,006 54,336 70,739 76,418 Retailing 34,129 32,859 56,326 54,616 Healthcare equipment and services 32,415 30,828 55,847 49,063 Capital goods 29,116 28,016 52,469 52,849 Government and public education 41,648 40,253 48,786 48,322 Banking 42,772 41,399 48,204 48,078 Materials 23,378 22,384 43,443 42,699 Energy 20,338 19,739 41,454 41,156 Consumer services 21,486 21,080 34,067 34,217 Food, beverage and tobacco 15,460 14,437 33,897 30,541 Commercial services and supplies 18,808 19,770 30,819 32,007 Utilities 9,528 9,253 25,772 25,243 Transportation 16,149 15,280 23,307 22,595 Media 11,886 13,070 22,971 22,655 Individuals and trusts 16,107 14,864 20,238 18,681 Pharmaceuticals and biotechnology 4,433 6,455 15,066 13,986 Software and services 5,641 6,814 12,783 14,172 Technology hardware and equipment 5,387 6,166 12,041 12,733 Insurance, including monolines 5,023 5,926 11,169 12,203 Consumer durables and apparel 5,690 5,427 10,015 9,757 Automobiles and components 3,768 3,165 9,420 8,424 Telecommunication services 3,702 4,541 9,008 11,423 Food and staples retailing 3,742 3,950 7,214 7,909 Religious and social organizations 4,978 5,452 6,586 7,677 Other 5,253 5,357 9,373 8,309 Total commercial credit exposure by industry $ 500,582 $ 507,494 $ 823,971 $ 823,825 Net credit default protection purchased on total commitments (3) $ (6,878 ) $ (8,085 ) (1) Includes U.S. small business commercial exposure.

(3) Represents net notional credit protection purchased. For additional information, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Risk Mitigation on page 112 . Monoline Exposure Monoline exposure is reported in the insurance industry and managed under insurance portfolio industry limits. We have indirect exposure to monolines primarily in the form of guarantees supporting our loans, investment portfolios, securitizations and credit-enhanced securities as part of our public finance business, and other selected products. Such indirect exposure exists when we purchase credit protection from monolines to hedge all or a portion of the credit risk on certain credit exposures including loans and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). We underwrite our public finance exposure by evaluating the underlying securities. We also have indirect exposure to monolines in the form of guarantees supporting our mortgage and other loan sales. Indirect exposure may exist when credit protection was purchased from monolines to hedge all or a portion of the credit risk on certain mortgage and other loan exposures. A loss may occur when we are required to repurchase a loan due to a breach of the representations and warranties, and the market value of the loan has declined, or we are required to indemnify or provide recourse for a guarantor's loss. For more information regarding our exposure to representations and warranties, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Representations and Warranties on page 54 and Note 7 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements . 111 Table of Contents Table 58 presents the notional amount of our monoline derivative credit exposure, mark-to-market adjustment and the counterparty credit valuation adjustment. The notional amount of monoline exposure decreased $2.6 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 due to terminations, paydowns and maturities of monoline contracts. Table 58 Derivative Credit Exposures (Dollars in millions) September 30 2014 December 31 2013 Notional amount of monoline exposure $ 7,993 $ 10,631 Mark-to-market $ 91 $ 97 Counterparty credit valuation adjustment (7 ) (15 ) Net mark-to-market $ 84 $ 82 Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 2014 2013 2014 2013 Gains (losses) from credit valuation changes $ (2 ) $ 16 $ 1 $ 61 Risk Mitigation We purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. To lower the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, we may add credit exposure within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. At September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 , net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, was $6.9 billion and $8.1 billion . We recorded net gains of $15 million and net losses of $87 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to net losses of $109 million and $238 million for the same periods in 2013 on these positions. The gains and losses on these instruments were offset by gains and losses on the related exposures. The VaR results for these exposures are included in the fair value option portfolio information in Table 66 . For additional information, see Trading Risk Management on page 122 .

(4) NR is comprised of index positions held and any names that have not been rated. In addition to our net notional credit default protection purchased to cover the funded and unfunded portion of certain credit exposures, credit derivatives are used for market-making activities for clients and establishing positions intended to profit from directional or relative value changes. We execute the majority of our credit derivative trades in the OTC market with large, multinational financial institutions, including broker-dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety of other investors. Because these transactions are executed in the OTC market, we are subject to settlement risk. We are also subject to credit risk in the event that these counterparties fail to perform under the terms of these contracts. In most cases, credit derivative transactions are executed on a daily margin basis. Therefore, events such as a credit downgrade, depending on the ultimate rating level, or a breach of credit covenants would typically require an increase in the amount of collateral required by the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow us to take additional protective measures such as early termination of all trades. Table 61 presents the total contract/notional amount of credit derivatives outstanding and includes both purchased and written credit derivatives. The credit risk amounts are measured as net asset exposure by counterparty, taking into consideration all contracts with the counterparty. For more information on our written credit derivatives, see Note 2 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . The credit risk amounts discussed above and presented in Table 61 take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements while amounts disclosed in Note 2 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements are shown on a gross basis. Credit risk reflects the potential benefit from offsetting exposure to non-credit derivative products with the same counterparties that may be netted upon the occurrence of certain events, thereby reducing our overall exposure.

We calculate CVA based on a modeled expected exposure that incorporates current market risk factors including changes in market spreads and non-credit related market factors that affect the value of a derivative. The exposure also takes into consideration credit mitigants such as legally enforceable master netting agreements and collateral. For additional information, see Note 2 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements .

We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in government policies. A risk management framework is in place to measure, monitor and manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. Management oversight of country risk, including cross-border risk, is the responsibility of the Country Credit Risk Committee, a subcommittee of the CRC. In addition to the direct risk of doing business in a country, we also are exposed to indirect country risks (e.g., related to the collateral received on secured financing transactions or related to client clearing activities). These indirect exposures are managed in the normal course of business through credit, market and operational risk governance, rather than through country risk governance. Non-U.S. exposure is presented on an internal risk management basis and includes sovereign and non-sovereign credit exposure, securities and other investments issued by or domiciled in countries other than the U.S. The risk assignments by country can be adjusted for external guarantees and certain collateral types. Exposures that are subject to external guarantees are reported under the country of the guarantor. Exposures with tangible collateral are reflected in the country where the collateral is held. For securities received, other than cross-border resale agreements, outstandings are assigned to the domicile of the issuer of the securities. Funded loans and loan equivalents include loans, leases, and other extensions of credit and funds, including letters of credit and due from placements, which have not been reduced by collateral, hedges or credit default protection. Funded loans and loan equivalents are reported net of charge-offs but prior to any allowance for loan and lease losses. Unfunded commitments are the undrawn portion of legally binding commitments related to loans and loan equivalents. Net counterparty exposure includes the fair value of derivatives, including the counterparty risk associated with credit default swaps (CDS), and secured financing transactions. Derivative exposures are presented net of collateral, which is predominantly cash, pledged under legally enforceable master netting agreements. Secured financing transaction exposures are presented net of eligible cash or securities pledged as collateral. Securities and other investments are carried at fair value and long securities exposures are netted against short exposures with the same underlying issuer to, but not below, zero (i.e., negative issuer exposures are reported as zero ). Other investments include our GPI portfolio and strategic investments. Net country exposure represents country exposure less hedges and credit default protection purchased, net of credit default protection sold. We hedge certain of our country exposures with credit default protection primarily in the form of single-name, as well as indexed and tranched CDS. The exposures associated with these hedges represent the amount that would be realized upon the isolated default of an individual issuer in the relevant country assuming a zero recovery rate for that individual issuer, and are calculated based on the CDS notional amount less any fair value receivable or payable. Changes in the assumption of an isolated default can produce different results in a particular tranche. 114 Table of Contents Table 63 presents our 20 largest non-U.S. country exposures at September 30, 2014 . These exposures accounted for 88 percent of our total non-U.S. exposure at both September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . Net country exposure for these 20 countries increased $7.3 billion from December 31, 2013 driven by higher derivatives and trading securities exposure in the United Kingdom, France and Italy and increased funded and unfunded loan and loan equivalents exposure in Japan, Netherlands and Hong Kong. These increases were partially offset by reductions in funded and unfunded loan and loan equivalents exposure in Italy, Russia and Germany, and decreases in securities exposure in Brazil and Germany.

Net exposure to Russia was reduced to $3.8 billion at September 30, 2014 , concentrated in oil and gas companies and commercial banks. Our exposure to Ukraine was minimal. In response to Russian actions, U.S. and European governments have imposed sanctions on a limited number of Russian individuals and business entities. The situation remains fluid with potential for further escalation of geopolitical tensions, increased severity of sanctions against Russian interests, and possible Russian counter-measures. Certain European countries, including Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, have experienced varying degrees of financial stress in recent years. While market conditions have stabilized, policymakers continue to address fundamental challenges of competitiveness, growth and high unemployment. A return of financial instability in these countries could disrupt financial markets and have a detrimental impact on global economic conditions and sovereign and non-sovereign debt in these countries. Net exposure at September 30, 2014 to Italy and Spain was $4.8 billion and $3.5 billion as presented in Table 63 . Net exposure at September 30, 2014 to Greece, Ireland and Portugal, in aggregate, was $2.1 billion. We expect to continue to support client activities in the region and our exposures may vary over time as we monitor the situation and manage our risk profile. 115 Table of Contents Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses increased $340 million to $636 million , and decreased $1.2 billion to $2.1 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in 2013 . The provision for credit losses was $407 million and $1.4 billion lower than net charge-offs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 , resulting in a reduction in the allowance for credit losses primarily due to continued improvement in the home loans and credit card portfolios, partially offset by $400 million of additional costs associated with the consumer relief portion of the DoJ Settlement. In the nine months ended September 30, 2014 , these reductions were partially offset by an increase in the allowance for credit losses for the commercial portfolio. This compared to a reduction of $1.4 billion and $3.1 billion in the allowance for credit losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013 . The provision for credit losses for the consumer portfolio increased $734 million to $544 million , and decreased $934 million to $1.4 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in 2013 . The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2014 was primarily due to $400 million of additional costs associated with the consumer relief portion of the DoJ Settlement and recoveries in the PCI loan portfolio in the prior year. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 was primarily due to continued improvement in the home loans portfolios as a result of increased home prices, improved delinquencies and continued loan balance run-off, as well as improvement in the credit card portfolios primarily driven by lower delinquencies. There was no provision for credit losses related to the PCI loan portfolio for the three months ended September 30, 2014 and a provision benefit of $106 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 . This compared to a benefit of $248 million and $707 million for the same periods in 2013 . For more information on the DoJ Settlement, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Other Mortgage-related Matters on page 61 . The provision for credit losses for the commercial portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, decreased $394 million to $92 million , and $230 million to $705 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in 2013 driven by improved asset quality in the current year. 116 Table of Contents Allowance for Credit Losses Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses The allowance for loan and lease losses is comprised of two components. The first component covers nonperforming commercial loans and TDRs. The second component covers loans and leases on which there are incurred losses that are not yet individually identifiable, as well as incurred losses that may not be represented in the loss forecast models. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses based on the total of these two components, each of which is described in more detail below. The allowance for loan and lease losses excludes LHFS and loans accounted for under the fair value option as the fair value reflects a credit risk component. The first component of the allowance for loan and lease losses covers both nonperforming commercial loans and all TDRs within the consumer and commercial portfolios. These loans are subject to impairment measurement based on the present value of projected future cash flows discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate, or in certain circumstances, impairment may also be based upon the collateral value or the loan's observable market price if available. Impairment measurement for the renegotiated consumer credit card, small business credit card and unsecured consumer TDR portfolios is based on the present value of projected cash flows discounted using the average portfolio contractual interest rate, excluding promotionally priced loans, in effect prior to restructuring. For purposes of computing this specific loss component of the allowance, larger impaired loans are evaluated individually and smaller impaired loans are evaluated as a pool using historical experience for the respective product types and risk ratings of the loans. The second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses covers the remaining consumer and commercial loans and leases that have incurred losses that are not yet individually identifiable. The allowance for consumer and certain homogeneous commercial loan and lease products is based on aggregated portfolio evaluations, generally by product type. Loss forecast models are utilized that consider a variety of factors including, but not limited to, historical loss experience, estimated defaults or foreclosures based on portfolio trends, delinquencies, economic trends and credit scores. Our consumer real estate loss forecast model estimates the portion of loans that will default based on individual loan attributes, the most significant of which are refreshed LTV or CLTV, and borrower credit score as well as vintage and geography, all of which are further broken down into current delinquency status. Additionally, we incorporate the delinquency status of underlying first-lien loans on our junior-lien home equity portfolio in our allowance process. Incorporating refreshed LTV and CLTV into our probability of default allows us to factor the impact of changes in home prices into our allowance for loan and lease losses. These loss forecast models are updated on a quarterly basis to incorporate information reflecting the current economic environment. As of September 30, 2014 , the loss forecast process resulted in reductions in the allowance for all major consumer portfolios compared to December 31, 2013. The allowance for commercial loan and lease losses is established by product type after analyzing historical loss experience, internal risk rating, current economic conditions, industry performance trends, geographic and obligor concentrations within each portfolio and any other pertinent information. The statistical models for commercial loans are generally updated annually and utilize our historical database of actual defaults and other data. The loan risk ratings and composition of the commercial portfolios used to calculate the allowance are updated quarterly to incorporate the most recent data reflecting the current economic environment. For risk-rated commercial loans, we estimate the probability of default and the LGD based on our historical experience of defaults and credit losses. Factors considered when assessing the internal risk rating include the value of the underlying collateral, if applicable, the industry in which the obligor operates, the obligor's liquidity and other financial indicators, and other quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to the obligor's credit risk. As of September 30, 2014 , the allowance increased for all major commercial portfolios compared to December 31, 2013. Also included within the second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses are reserves to cover losses that are incurred but, in our assessment, may not be adequately represented in the historical loss data used in the loss forecast models. For example, factors that we consider include, among others, changes in lending policies and procedures, changes in economic and business conditions, changes in the nature and size of the portfolio, changes in portfolio concentrations, changes in the volume and severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such as competition, and legal and regulatory requirements. We also consider factors that are applicable to unique portfolio segments. For example, we consider the risk of uncertainty in our loss forecasting models related to junior-lien home equity loans that are current, but have first-lien loans that we do not service that are 30 days or more past due. In addition, we consider the increased risk of default associated with our interest-only loans that have yet to enter the amortization period. Further, we consider the inherent uncertainty in mathematical models that are built upon historical data. 117 Table of Contents During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 , the factors that impacted the allowance for loan and lease losses included overall improvements in the credit quality of the portfolios driven by continuing improvements in the U.S. economy and housing and labor markets, continuing proactive credit risk management initiatives and the impact of recent higher credit quality originations. Additionally, the resolution of uncertainties through current recognition of net charge-offs has impacted the amount of reserve needed in certain portfolios. Evidencing the improvements in the U.S. economy and housing and labor markets are modest growth in consumer spending, improvements in unemployment levels, a decrease in the absolute level and our share of national consumer bankruptcy filings, and a rise in both residential building activity and overall home prices. In addition to these improvements, paydowns, charge-offs, sales, returns to performing status and upgrades out of criticized continued to outpace new nonaccrual loans and reservable criticized commercial loans. We monitor differences between estimated and actual incurred loan and lease losses. This monitoring process includes periodic assessments by senior management of loan and lease portfolios and the models used to estimate incurred losses in those portfolios. Additions to, or reductions of, the allowance for loan and lease losses generally are recorded through charges or credits to the provision for credit losses. Credit exposures deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan and lease losses. Recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan and lease losses. The allowance for loan and lease losses for the consumer portfolio, as presented in Table 65 , was $10.7 billion at September 30, 2014 , a decrease of $2.7 billion from December 31, 2013 . The decrease was primarily in the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios due to increased home prices, as evidenced by improving LTV statistics as presented in Tables 35 and 37, improved delinquencies and a decrease in consumer loan balances. Further, the residential mortgage and home equity allowance declined due to write-offs in our PCI loan portfolio. These write-offs decreased the PCI valuation allowance included as part of the allowance for loan and lease losses. The decrease in the allowance related to the U.S. credit card and unsecured consumer lending portfolios in CBB was primarily due to improvement in delinquencies and bankruptcies. For example, in the U.S. credit card portfolio, accruing loans 30 days or more past due decreased to $1.7 billion at September 30, 2014 from $2.1 billion (to 1.91 percent from 2.25 percent of outstanding U.S. credit card loans) at December 31, 2013 , and accruing loans 90 days or more past due decreased to $831 million at September 30, 2014 from $1.1 billion (to 0.93 percent from 1.14 percent of outstanding U.S. credit card loans) at December 31, 2013 . See Tables 32 , 33 , 42 and 44 for additional details on key credit statistics for the credit card and other unsecured consumer lending portfolios. The allowance for loan and lease losses for the commercial portfolio, as presented in Table 65 , was $4.4 billion at September 30, 2014 , an increase of $427 million from December 31, 2013 . The commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure decreased to $11.8 billion at September 30, 2014 from $12.9 billion (to 2.79 percent from 3.02 percent of total commercial utilized reservable exposure) at December 31, 2013 . Nonperforming commercial loans increased $43 million from December 31, 2013 to $1.4 billion at September 30, 2014 (to 0.35 percent from 0.34 percent of outstanding commercial loans). See Tables 48 , 49 and 51 for additional details on key commercial credit statistics. The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding was 1.71 percent at September 30, 2014 compared to 1.90 percent at December 31, 2013 . The decrease in the ratio was primarily due to improved credit quality driven by improved economic conditions and write-offs in the PCI loan portfolio. The September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 ratios above include the PCI loan portfolio. Excluding the PCI loan portfolio, the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding was 1.57 percent at September 30, 2014 compared to 1.67 percent at December 31, 2013 . 118 Table of Contents Table 64 presents a rollforward of the allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013 .

Consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option included residential mortgage loans of $2.0 billion and $2.0 billion and home equity loans of $179 million and $147 million at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . Commercial loans accounted for under the fair value option included U.S. commercial loans of $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion and non-U.S. commercial loans of $4.8 billion and $6.4 billion at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . (2) Includes allowance for loan and lease losses for U.S. small business commercial loans of $530 million and $462 million at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . (3) Includes allowance for loan and lease losses for impaired commercial loans of $188 million and $277 million at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . (4) Includes $1.6 billion and $2.5 billion of valuation allowance presented with the allowance for loan and lease losses related to PCI loans at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we also estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments such as letters of credit, financial guarantees, unfunded bankers' acceptances and binding loan commitments, excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value option. Unfunded lending commitments are subject to the same assessment as funded loans, including estimates of probability of default and LGD. Due to the nature of unfunded commitments, the estimate of probable losses must also consider utilization. To estimate the portion of these undrawn commitments that is likely to be drawn by a borrower at the time of estimated default, analyses of the Corporation's historical experience are applied to the unfunded commitments to estimate the funded EAD. The expected loss for unfunded lending commitments is the product of the probability of default, the LGD and the EAD, adjusted for any qualitative factors including economic uncertainty and inherent imprecision in models. The reserve for unfunded lending commitments was $529 million at September 30, 2014 , an increase of $45 million from December 31, 2013 , driven by increases in expected losses. 121 Table of Contents Market Risk Management Market risk is the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions. This risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations, primarily within our Global Markets segment. We are also exposed to these risks in other areas of the Corporation (e.g., our ALM activities). In the event of market stress, these risks could have a material impact on the results of the Corporation. For additional information, see Interest Rate Risk Management for Non-trading Activities on page 128 . Our traditional banking loan and deposit products are non-trading positions and are generally reported at amortized cost for assets or the amount owed for liabilities (historical cost). However, these positions are still subject to changes in economic value based on varying market conditions, with one of the primary risks being changes in the levels of interest rates. The risk of adverse changes in the economic value of our non-trading positions arising from changes in interest rates is managed through our ALM activities. We have elected to account for certain assets and liabilities under the fair value option. Our trading positions are reported at fair value with changes reflected in income. Trading positions are subject to various changes in market-based risk factors. The majority of this risk is generated by our activities in the interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, equity and commodities markets. In addition, the values of assets and liabilities could change due to market liquidity, correlations across markets and expectations of market volatility. We seek to manage these risk exposures by using a variety of techniques that encompass a broad range of financial instruments. The key risk management techniques are discussed in more detail in the Trading Risk Management section. Global Markets Risk Management is an independent function within the Corporation that supports the Global Banking and Markets Risk Executive. The Global Markets Risk Committee (GMRC), chaired by the Global Markets Risk Executive, has been designated by the Asset Liability and Market Risk Committee (ALMRC) as the primary risk governance authority for Global Markets . The GMRC's focus is to take a forward-looking view of the primary credit, market and operational risks impacting Global Markets and prioritize those that need a proactive risk mitigation strategy. Global Markets Risk Management is responsible for providing senior management with a clear and comprehensive understanding of the trading risks to which the Corporation is exposed. These responsibilities include ownership of market risk policy, developing and maintaining quantitative risk models, calculating aggregated risk measures, establishing and monitoring position limits consistent with risk appetite, conducting daily reviews and analysis of trading inventory, approving material risk exposures and fulfilling regulatory requirements. Market risks that impact businesses outside of Global Markets are monitored and governed by their respective governance functions. Quantitative risk models, such as VaR, are an essential component in evaluating the market risks within a portfolio. The Enterprise Model Risk Committee (EMRC) reports to the ALMRC and is responsible for providing management oversight and approval of model risk management and governance. The EMRC defines model risk standards, consistent with the Corporation's risk framework and risk appetite, prevailing regulatory guidance and industry best practice. Models must meet certain validation criteria, including effective challenge of the model development process and a sufficient demonstration of developmental evidence incorporating a comparison of alternative theories and approaches. The EMRC ensures model standards are consistent with model risk requirements and monitors the effective challenge in the model validation process across the Corporation. In addition, the relevant stakeholders must agree on any required actions or restrictions to the models and maintain a stringent monitoring process to ensure continued compliance. For more information on the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities, see Note 14 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements . For more information on our market risk management process, see page 108 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Trading Risk Management To evaluate risk in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of revenues generated by individual positions as well as portfolios of positions. Various techniques and procedures are utilized to enable the most complete understanding of these risks. Quantitative measures of market risk are evaluated on a daily basis from a single position to the portfolio of the Corporation. These measures include sensitivities of positions to various market risk factors, such as the potential impact on revenue from a one basis point change in interest rates, and statistical measures utilizing both actual and hypothetical market moves, such as VaR and stress testing. Periods of extreme market stress influence the reliability of these techniques to varying degrees. Qualitative evaluations of market risk utilize the suite of quantitative risk measures while understanding each of their respective limitations. Additionally, risk managers independently evaluate the risk of the portfolios under the current market environment and potential future environments. 122 Table of Contents VaR is a common statistic used to measure market risk as it allows the aggregation of market risk factors, including the effects of portfolio diversification. A VaR model simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR represents the loss a portfolio is not expected to exceed more than a certain number of times per period, based on a specified holding period, confidence level and window of historical data. We use one VaR model consistently across the trading portfolios that uses a historical simulation approach based on a three-year window of historical data. Our primary VaR statistic is equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level. This means that for a VaR with a one-day holding period, there should not be losses in excess of VaR, on average, 99 out of 100 trading days. Within any VaR model, there are significant and numerous assumptions that will differ from company to company. The accuracy of a VaR model depends on the availability and quality of historical data for each of the risk factors in the portfolio. A VaR model may require additional modeling assumptions for new products that do not have the necessary historical market data or for less liquid positions for which accurate daily prices are not consistently available. For positions with insufficient historical data for the VaR calculation, the process for establishing an appropriate proxy is based on fundamental and statistical analysis of the new product or less liquid position. This analysis identifies reasonable alternatives that replicate both the expected volatility and correlation to other market risk factors that the missing data would be expected to experience. VaR may not be indicative of realized revenue volatility as changes in market conditions or in the composition of the portfolio can have a material impact on the results. In particular, the historical data used for the VaR calculation might indicate higher or lower levels of portfolio diversification than will be experienced. In order for the VaR model to reflect current market conditions, we update the historical data underlying our VaR model on a weekly basis, or more frequently during periods of market stress, and regularly review the assumptions underlying the model. A relatively minor portion of risks related to our trading positions are not included in VaR. These risks are reviewed as part of our ICAAP. Global Markets Risk Management continually reviews, evaluates and enhances our VaR model so that it reflects the material risks in our trading portfolio. Changes to the VaR model are reviewed and approved prior to implementation and any material changes are reported to management through the appropriate governance committees. Trading limits on quantitative risk measures, including VaR, are monitored on a daily basis. These trading limits are independently set by Global Markets Risk Management and reviewed on a regular basis to ensure they remain relevant and within our overall risk appetite for market risks. Trading limits are reviewed in the context of market liquidity, volatility and strategic business priorities. Trading limits are set at both a granular level to ensure extensive coverage of risks as well as at aggregated portfolios to account for correlations among risk factors. All trading limits are approved at least annually and the ALMRC has given authority to the GMRC to approve changes to trading limits throughout the year. Approved trading limits are stored and tracked in a centralized limits management system. Trading limit excesses are communicated to management for review. Certain quantitative market risk measures and corresponding limits have been identified as critical in the Corporation's Risk Appetite Statement. These risk appetite limits are monitored on a daily basis and are approved at least annually by the Board. The market risk based risk appetite limits were not exceeded during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 . In periods of market stress, the GMRC members communicate daily to discuss losses, key risk positions and any limit excesses. As a result of this process, the businesses may selectively reduce risk. Market risk VaR for trading activities as presented in Table 66 differs from VaR used for regulatory capital calculations (regulatory VaR). The VaR disclosed in Table 66 excludes both counterparty CVA, which are adjustments to the mark-to-market value of our derivative exposures to reflect the impact of the credit quality of counterparties on our derivative assets, and the corresponding hedges. Current regulatory standards require that regulatory VaR only exclude counterparty CVA but include the corresponding hedges. The holding period for regulatory VaR for capital calculations is 10 days, while for the market risk VaR presented below, it is one day. Except for the differences between regulatory and market risk VaR regarding the inclusion of CVA hedges and the holding period used, both measures utilize the same process and methodology. 123 Table of Contents To provide visibility of market risks to which the Corporation is exposed, Table 66 presents the total market-based trading portfolio VaR which includes our total covered positions trading portfolio and the impact from less liquid trading exposures. Covered positions are defined by regulatory standards as trading assets and liabilities, both on- and off-balance sheet, that meet a defined set of specifications. These specifications identify the most liquid trading positions which are intended to be held for a short-term horizon and where the Corporation is able to hedge the material risk elements in a two-way market. Positions in less liquid markets, or where there are restrictions on the ability to trade the positions, typically do not qualify as covered positions. Foreign exchange and commodity positions are always considered covered positions, except for structural foreign currency positions that we choose to exclude with prior regulatory approval. Certain positions related to our counterparty CVA and corresponding hedges are considered covered positions; however, these are excluded from the VaR results presented in Table 66 . In addition, Table 66 presents our fair value option portfolio, which includes the funded and unfunded exposures for which we elect the fair value option and their corresponding hedges. The fair value option portfolio combined with the total market-based trading portfolio VaR represents the Corporation's total market-based portfolio VaR. This population is consistent with the risk appetite limits set by the Board. The market risk across all business segments to which the Corporation is exposed is included in the total market-based portfolio VaR results. The majority of this portfolio is within the Global Markets segment. Table 66 presents period-end, average, high and low daily trading VaR for the three months ended September 30, 2014 , June 30, 2014 and September 30, 2013 , as well as average daily trading VaR for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013 .

Therefore the impact from less liquid exposures and the amount of portfolio diversification, which is the difference between the total portfolio and the sum of the individual components, are not relevant. The average total market-based trading portfolio VaR remained relatively unchanged for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2014 . The average total market-based portfolio VaR decreased slightly for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2014 primarily driven by increased portfolio diversification across the total market-based portfolio. The period-end total market-based trading portfolio VaR increased during the three months ended September 30, 2014 driven by increased exposure to the equity markets combined with a reduction in portfolio diversification. 124 Table of Contents The graph below presents the daily total market-based trading portfolio VaR for the previous five quarters, corresponding to the data presented in Table 66 . Additional VaR statistics produced within the Corporation's single VaR model are provided in Table 67 at the same level of detail as in Table 66 . Evaluating VaR with additional statistics allows for an increased understanding of the risks in the portfolio as the historical market data used in the VaR calculation does not necessarily follow a predefined statistical distribution. Table 67 presents average trading VaR statistics for 99 percent and 95 percent confidence levels for the three months ended September 30, 2014 , June 30, 2014 and September 30, 2013 .

A backtesting excess occurs when a trading loss exceeds the VaR for the corresponding day. These excesses are evaluated to understand the positions and market moves that produced the trading loss and to ensure that the VaR methodology accurately represents those losses. As our primary VaR statistic used for backtesting is based on a 99 percent confidence level and a one-day holding period, we expect one trading loss in excess of VaR every 100 days, or between two to three trading losses in excess of VaR over the course of a year. The number of backtesting excesses observed can differ from the statistically expected number of excesses if the current level of market volatility is materially different than the level of market volatility that existed during the three years of historical data used in the VaR calculation. We conduct daily backtesting on our portfolios, ranging from the total market-based portfolio to individual trading areas. Additionally, we conduct daily backtesting on our regulatory VaR results as well as the VaR results for key legal entities, regions and risk factors. These results are reported to senior market risk management. Senior management, including the GMRC, regularly reviews and evaluates the results of these tests. The government agencies that regulate our operations also regularly review these results. The trading revenue used for backtesting is defined by regulatory agencies in order to most closely align with the VaR component of the regulatory capital calculation. This revenue differs from total trading-related revenue in that it excludes revenue from trading activities that either do not generate market risk or the market risk cannot be included in VaR. Some examples of the types of revenue excluded for backtesting are fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income and intraday trading revenues. In addition, counterparty CVA is not included in the VaR component of the regulatory capital calculation and is therefore not included in the revenue used for backtesting of the regulatory VaR results. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 , there were no days in which there was a backtesting excess for our total market-based portfolio or regulatory VaR results, utilizing a one-day holding period. Total Trading-related Revenue Total trading-related revenue, excluding brokerage fees, represents the total amount earned from trading positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. Trading account assets and liabilities are reported at fair value. For more information on fair value, see Note 14 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Trading-related revenues can be volatile and are largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand. Also, trading-related revenues are dependent on the volume and type of transactions, the level of risk assumed, and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the ever-changing market environment. Significant daily revenues by business are monitored and the primary drivers of these are reviewed. When it is deemed material, an explanation of these revenues is provided to the GMRC. 126 Table of Contents The histogram below is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2014 and March 31, 2014 . During the three months ended September 30, 2014 , positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 97 percent, or 64 trading days, of which 68 percent (45 days) were daily trading gains of over $25 million and the largest loss was $6 million. This compares to the three months ended June 30, 2014 , where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 98 percent, or 64 trading days, of which 78 percent (51 days) were daily trading gains of over $25 million and the largest loss was $15 million. During the three months ended March 31, 2014 , positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 100 percent, or 61 trading days, of which 89 percent (54 days) were daily trading gains of over $25 million. Trading Portfolio Stress Testing Because the very nature of a VaR model suggests results can exceed our estimates and it is dependent on a limited historical window, we also stress test our portfolio using scenario analysis. This analysis estimates the change in value of our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements. A set of scenarios, categorized as either historical or hypothetical, are computed daily for the overall trading portfolio and individual businesses. These scenarios include shocks to underlying market risk factors that may be well beyond the shocks found in the historical data used to calculate VaR. Historical scenarios simulate the impact of the market moves that occurred during a period of extended historical market stress. Generally, a 10-business day window or longer representing the most severe point during a crisis is selected for each historical scenario. Hypothetical scenarios provide simulations of the estimated portfolio impact from potential future market stress events. Scenarios are reviewed and updated in response to changing positions and new economic or political information. In addition, new or adhoc scenarios are developed to address specific potential market events. For example, a stress test was conducted to estimate the impact of a significant increase in global interest rates and the corresponding impact across other asset classes. The stress tests are reviewed on a regular basis and the results are presented to senior management. 127 Table of Contents Stress testing for the trading portfolio is integrated with enterprise-wide stress testing and incorporated into the limits framework. A process is in place to promote consistency between the scenarios used for the trading portfolio and those used for enterprise-wide stress testing. The scenarios used for enterprise-wide stress testing purposes differ from the typical trading portfolio scenarios in that they have a longer time horizon and the results are forecasted over multiple periods for use in consolidated capital and liquidity planning. For additional information, see Managing Risk on page 63 . Interest Rate Risk Management for Non-trading Activities The following discussion presents net interest income excluding the impact of trading-related activities. Interest rate risk represents the most significant market risk exposure to our non-trading balance sheet. Interest rate risk is measured as the potential change in net interest income caused by movements in market interest rates. Client-facing activities, primarily lending and deposit-taking, create interest rate sensitive positions on our balance sheet. We prepare forward-looking forecasts of net interest income. The baseline forecast takes into consideration expected future business growth, ALM positioning and the direction of interest rate movements as implied by the market-based forward curve. We then measure and evaluate the impact that alternative interest rate scenarios have on the baseline forecast in order to assess interest rate sensitivity under varied conditions. The net interest income forecast is frequently updated for changing assumptions and differing outlooks based on economic trends, market conditions and business strategies. Thus, we continually monitor our balance sheet position in an effort to maintain an acceptable level of exposure to interest rate changes. The interest rate scenarios that we analyze incorporate balance sheet assumptions such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, changes in funding mix, product repricing and maturity characteristics. Our overall goal is to manage interest rate risk so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital. Table 68 presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . Table 68 Forward Rates September 30, 2014 December 31, 2013 Federal Funds Three-month LIBOR 10-Year Swap Federal Funds Three-month LIBOR 10-Year Swap Spot rates 0.25 % 0.24 % 2.64 % 0.25 % 0.25 % 3.09 % 12-month forward rates 0.50 0.82 2.99 0.25 0.43 3.52 Table 69 shows the pretax dollar impact to forecasted net interest income over the next 12 months from September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 , resulting from instantaneous parallel and non-parallel shocks to the market-based forward curve. Periodically we evaluate the scenarios presented to ensure that they are meaningful in the context of the current rate environment. For further discussion of net interest income excluding the impact of trading-related activities, see page 21 . We continue to be asset-sensitive to both a parallel move in interest rates and, to a lesser degree, a long-end led steepening of the yield curve. Additionally, rising interest rates impact the fair value of debt securities and, accordingly, for debt securities classified as AFS, may adversely affect accumulated OCI and thus capital levels under the Basel 3 capital rules. Under instantaneous upward parallel shifts, the near term adverse impact to OCI and Basel 3 capital is reduced over time by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income. For more information on the phase-in provisions of Basel 3 including OCI, see Capital Management Regulatory Capital on page 64 . 128 Table of Contents Table 69 Estimated Net Interest Income Excluding Trading-related Net Interest Income (Dollars in millions) Curve Change Short Rate (bps) Long Rate (bps) September 30 2014 December 31 2013 Parallel shifts +100 bps instantaneous shift +100 +100 $ 3,203 $ 3,229 -50 bps instantaneous shift -50 -50 (2,047 ) (1,616 ) Flatteners Short-end instantaneous change +100 2,162 2,210 Long-end instantaneous change -50 (909 ) (641 ) Steepeners Short-end instantaneous change -50 (1,105 ) (937 ) Long-end instantaneous change +100 1,087 1,066 The sensitivity analysis in Table 69 assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates. As part of our ALM activities, we use securities, residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity. The behavior of our deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income. The sensitivity analysis in Table 69 assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher-yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce the Corporation's benefit in those scenarios. Securities The securities portfolio is an integral part of our interest rate risk management, which includes our ALM positioning, and is primarily comprised of debt securities including MBS and to a lesser extent U.S. Treasury, corporate, municipal and other debt securities. As part of the ALM positioning, we use derivatives to hedge interest rate and duration risk. At September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 , our debt securities portfolio had a carrying value of $368.1 billion and $323.9 billion . During the three months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013 , we purchased debt securities of $88.9 billion and $26.4 billion, sold $48.3 billion and $16.5 billion , and had maturities and received paydowns of $25.7 billion and $25.1 billion, respectively. We realized $432 million and $356 million in net gains on sales of AFS debt securities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013 , we purchased debt securities of $210.2 billion and $125.6 billion , sold $106.2 billion and $77.5 billion , and had maturities and received paydowns of $65.5 billion and $76.8 billion , respectively. We realized $1.2 billion and $881 million in net gains on sales of AFS debt securities. At September 30, 2014 , accumulated OCI included after-tax net unrealized loss es of $656 million on AFS debt securities and after-tax net unrealized loss es of $5 million on AFS marketable equity securities compared to after-tax net unrealized losses of $860 million and after-tax net unrealized losses of $5 million at September 30, 2013 . For more information on accumulated OCI, see Note 12 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) to the Consolidated Financial Statements . The pretax net amounts in accumulated OCI related to AFS debt securities decreased $1.6 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2014 and improved $4.1 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to a $1.1 billion net unrealized loss primarily due to the impact of interest rates. For more information on our securities portfolio, see Note 3 Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements . We recognized $1 million and $12 million of other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) losses in earnings on AFS debt securities in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to losses of $7 million and $20 million for the same periods in 2013 . OTTI losses in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013 were on non-agency RMBS and were recorded in other income on the Consolidated Statement of Income. The recognition of OTTI losses is based on a variety of factors, including the length of time and extent to which the market value has been less than amortized cost, the financial condition of the issuer of the security including credit ratings and any specific events affecting the operations of the issuer, underlying assets that collateralize the debt security, other industry and macroeconomic conditions, and our intent and ability to hold the security to recovery. 129 Table of Contents Residential Mortgage Portfolio At September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 , our residential mortgage portfolio was $224.7 billion and $248.1 billion excluding $2.0 billion of consumer residential mortgage loans accounted for under the fair value option at each period end. For more information on consumer fair value option loans, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Consumer Loans Accounted for Under the Fair Value Option on page 99 . The $23.3 billion decrease in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 was primarily due to paydowns, sales, charge-offs and transfers to foreclosed properties. These were partially offset by new origination volume retained on our balance sheet, as well as repurchases of delinquent loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA, which are part of our mortgage banking activities. Three Months Ended September 30, 2014 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2013 During the three months ended September 30, 2014 , CRES and GWIM originated $6.2 billion of first-lien mortgages that we retained compared to $14.0 billion in the same period in 2013 . We received paydowns of $10.2 billion compared to $13.8 billion in the same period in 2013 . We repurchased $1.5 billion of loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA and redelivered $687 million, primarily FHA-insured loans, compared to $3.1 billion and $1.7 billion in the same period in 2013 . Sales of loans, excluding redelivered FHA loans, were $9.1 billion compared to $1.1 billion in the same period in 2013 . Loans sold during the three months ended September 30, 2014 primarily consisted of loans insured under our long-term stand-by agreements as well as nonperforming and PCI loans. Gains recognized on the sales of residential mortgages were $210 million compared to $22 million in the same period in 2013 . Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2013 During the nine months ended September 30, 2014 , CRES and GWIM originated $16.8 billion of first-lien mortgages that we retained compared to $37.8 billion in the same period in 2013 . We received paydowns of $28.0 billion compared to $43.7 billion in the same period in 2013 . We repurchased $3.8 billion of loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA and redelivered $3.0 billion, primarily FHA-insured loans, compared to $9.1 billion and $3.6 billion in the same period in 2013 . Sales of loans, excluding redelivered FHA loans, were $12.2 billion compared to $1.4 billion in the same period in 2013 . Loans sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 primarily consisted of loans insured under our long-term stand-by agreements as well as nonperforming and PCI loans. Gains recognized on the sales of residential mortgages were $392 million compared to $38 million in the same period in 2013 . Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative Contracts Interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts are utilized in our ALM activities and serve as an efficient tool to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk. We use derivatives to hedge the variability in cash flows or changes in fair value on our balance sheet due to interest rate and foreign exchange components. For more information on our hedging activities, see Note 2 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Our interest rate contracts are generally non-leveraged generic interest rate and foreign exchange basis swaps, options, futures and forwards. In addition, we use foreign exchange contracts, including cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign currency futures contracts, foreign currency forward contracts and options to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Changes to the composition of our derivatives portfolio during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 reflect actions taken for interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk management. The decisions to reposition our derivatives portfolio are based on the current assessment of economic and financial conditions including the interest rate and foreign currency environments, balance sheet composition and trends, and the relative mix of our cash and derivative positions. 130 Table of Contents Table 70 presents derivatives utilized in our ALM activities including those designated as accounting and economic hedging instruments and shows the notional amount, fair value, weighted-average receive-fixed and pay-fixed rates, expected maturity and average estimated durations of our open ALM derivatives at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . These amounts do not include derivative hedges on our MSRs.

There were no forward starting pay-fixed swap positions at September 30, 2014 compared to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2013 . (2) Does not include basis adjustments on either fixed-rate debt issued by the Corporation or AFS debt securities, which are hedged using derivatives designated as fair value hedging instruments, that substantially offset the fair values of these derivatives. (3) At September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 , the notional amount of same-currency basis swaps was comprised of $102.7 billion and $145.2 billion in both foreign currency and U.S. dollar-denominated basis swaps in which both sides of the swap are in the same currency. (4) Foreign exchange basis swaps consisted of cross-currency variable interest rate swaps used separately or in conjunction with receive-fixed interest rate swaps. (5) Does not include foreign currency translation adjustments on certain non-U.S. debt issued by the Corporation that substantially offset the fair values of these derivatives. (6) The notional amount of option products of $1.3 billion at September 30, 2014 was comprised of $1.3 billion in foreign exchange options, $(10) million in swaptions and $17 million in purchased caps/floors. Option products of $(641) million at December 31, 2013 were comprised of $(2.0) billion in swaptions, $1.4 billion in foreign exchange options and $19 million in purchased caps/floors. (7) Reflects the net of long and short positions. Amounts shown as negative reflect a net short position. (8) The notional amount of foreign exchange contracts of $(22.7) billion at September 30, 2014 was comprised of $26.2 billion in foreign currency-denominated and cross-currency receive-fixed swaps, $(42.3) billion in net foreign currency forward rate contracts, $(8.7) billion in foreign currency-denominated pay-fixed swaps and $2.1 billion in net foreign currency futures contracts. Foreign exchange contracts of $(19.5) billion at December 31, 2013 were comprised of $36.1 billion in foreign currency-denominated and cross-currency receive-fixed swaps, $(49.3) billion in net foreign currency forward rate contracts, $(10.3) billion in foreign currency-denominated pay-fixed swaps and $4.0 billion in foreign currency futures contracts. 131 Table of Contents We use interest rate derivative instruments to hedge the variability in the cash flows of our assets and liabilities and other forecasted transactions (collectively referred to as cash flow hedges). The net losses on both open and terminated cash flow hedge derivative instruments recorded in accumulated OCI were $3.0 billion and $3.6 billion , on a pretax basis, at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . These net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the same period as the hedged cash flows affect earnings and will decrease income or increase expense on the respective hedged cash flows. Assuming no change in open cash flow derivative hedge positions and no changes in prices or interest rates beyond what is implied in forward yield curves at September 30, 2014 , the pretax net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings as follows: $905 million , or 30 percent, within the next year, 48 percent in years two through five, and 15 percent in years six through ten, with the remaining seven percent thereafter. For more information on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, see Note 2 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . We hedge our net investment in non-U.S. operations determined to have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar using forward foreign exchange contracts that typically settle in less than 180 days, cross-currency basis swaps and foreign exchange options. We recorded net after-tax losses on derivatives in accumulated OCI associated with net investment hedges which were offset by gains on our net investments in consolidated non-U.S. entities at September 30, 2014 . Mortgage Banking Risk Management We originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. We determine whether loans will be HFI or held-for-sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate. Interest rate risk and market risk can be substantial in the mortgage business. Fluctuations in interest rates drive consumer demand for new mortgages and the level of refinancing activity, which in turn, affects total origination and servicing income. Hedging the various sources of interest rate risk in mortgage banking is a complex process that requires complex modeling and ongoing monitoring. Typically, an increase in mortgage interest rates will lead to a decrease in mortgage originations and related fees. IRLCs and the related residential first mortgage LHFS are subject to interest rate risk between the date of the IRLC and the date the loans are sold to the secondary market, as an increase in mortgage interest rates will typically lead to a decrease in the value of these instruments. To hedge interest rate risk and certain market risks of IRLCs and residential first mortgage LHFS, we utilize forward loan sale commitments and other derivative instruments including purchased options. At September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 , the notional amounts of derivatives economically hedging the IRLCs and residential first mortgage LHFS were $8.2 billion and $7.9 billion. MSRs are nonfinancial assets created when the underlying mortgage loan is sold to investors and we retain the right to service the loan. Typically, an increase in mortgage rates will lead to an increase in the value of the MSRs driven by lower prepayment expectations. We use certain derivatives such as interest rate options, interest rate swaps, forward settlement contracts and eurodollar futures, as well as principal-only and interest-only MBS and U.S. Treasuries to hedge interest rate and certain other market risks of MSRs. The fair value and notional amounts of the derivative contracts and the fair value of securities hedging the MSRs were $(3.8) billion, $1.0 trillion and $51 million at September 30, 2014 and $(2.9) billion, $1.8 trillion and $2.5 billion at December 31, 2013 . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 , we recorded in mortgage banking income gains of $76 million and $840 million related to the change in fair value of the derivative contracts and other securities used to hedge the market risks of the MSRs compared to gains of $47 million and losses of $824 million for the same periods in 2013 . For more information on MSRs, see Note 17 Mortgage Servicing Rights to the Consolidated Financial Statements and for more information on mortgage banking income, see CRES on page 35 . 132 Table of Contents Compliance Risk Management The Global Compliance organization is responsible for overseeing compliance risk, which is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss or damage to the reputation of the Corporation in the event of the failure of the Corporation to comply with requirements of applicable laws, rules, regulations, related self-regulatory organization standards and codes of conduct. Compliance is at the core of the Corporation's culture and is a key component of our risk management process. The Global Compliance Framework, an addendum to our Risk Framework, outlines the elements and related high-level requirements of the Corporation's integrated global compliance program. It is supported by policies that articulate detailed requirements related to execution of the global compliance program. The Global Compliance Framework also defines the scope, roles and responsibilities of Global Compliance. It is designed to drive a comprehensive, risk-based approach for the proactive management, oversight and escalation of compliance risks across the Corporation. The Global Compliance Framework also provides senior management as well as the Board or appropriate Board-level committees with an outline for conducting objective oversight of the Corporation's compliance risk management activities. The Board provides oversight of compliance risks through its Audit Committee. Operational Risk Management The Corporation defines operational risk as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Operational risk may occur anywhere in the Corporation, including outsourced business processes, and is not limited to operations functions. Its effects may extend beyond financial losses. Operational risk includes legal risk. Successful operational risk management is particularly important to diversified financial services companies because of the nature, volume and complexity of the financial services business. Operational risk is a significant component in the calculation of total risk-weighted assets used in the Basel 3 capital estimate under the Advanced approaches. For more information on Basel 3 Advanced Approaches, see Capital Management Advanced Approaches on page 66 . We approach operational risk management from two perspectives to manage operational risk within the structure of the Corporation: (1) at the enterprise level to provide independent, integrated management of operational risk across the organization, and (2) at the business and enterprise control function levels to address operational risk in revenue producing and non-revenue producing units. The Operational Risk Management Program addresses the overarching processes for identifying, measuring, mitigating, controlling, monitoring, testing and reviewing operational risk, and reporting operational risk information to management and the Board. A sound internal governance structure enhances the effectiveness of the Corporation's Operational Risk Management Program and is accomplished at the enterprise level through formal oversight by the Board, the chief risk officer and a variety of management committees and risk oversight groups aligned to the Corporation's overall risk governance framework and practices. Of these, the Compliance and Operational Risk Committee (CORC) oversees the Corporation's policies and processes for sound operational risk management. The CORC also serves as an escalation point for critical operational risk matters within the Corporation. The CORC reports operational risk activities to the Enterprise Risk Committee of the Board. Within the Global Risk Management organization, the Corporate Operational Risk team develops and guides the strategies, policies, practices, controls and monitoring tools for assessing and managing operational risks across the organization and reports results to businesses, enterprise control functions, senior management, governance committees and the Board. The business and enterprise control functions are responsible for managing all the risks within their units, including operational risks. In addition to enterprise risk management tools such as loss reporting, scenario analysis and Risk and Control Self Assessments (RCSAs), operational risk executives, working in conjunction with senior business executives, have developed key tools to help identify, measure, mitigate and monitor risk in each business and enterprise control function. Examples of these include personnel management practices; data reconciliation processes; fraud management units; cybersecurity controls, processes and systems; transaction processing, monitoring and analysis; business recovery planning; and new product introduction processes. The business and enterprise control functions are also responsible for consistently implementing and monitoring adherence to corporate practices. 133 Table of Contents Business and enterprise control function management uses the enterprise RCSA process to identify and evaluate the status of risk and control issues including mitigation plans, as appropriate. The goals of this process are to assess changing market and business conditions, evaluate key risks impacting each business and enterprise control function, and assess the controls in place to mitigate the risks. Key operational risk indicators for these risks have been developed and are used to assist in identifying trends and issues on an enterprise, business and enterprise control function level. Independent review and challenge to the Corporation's overall operational risk management framework is performed by the Corporate Operational Risk Validation Team. Enterprise control functions have risk governance and control responsibilities for their enterprise programs (e.g., Global Technology and Operations Group, CFO Group, Global Marketing and Corporate Affairs, Global Human Resources). They provide insights on day-to-day risk activities throughout the Corporation by overseeing and managing the performance of their functions against Corporation-wide expectations. The enterprise control functions participate in the operational risk management process in two ways. First, these organizations manage risk in their functional department. Second, they provide specialized risk management services (e.g., information management, vendor management) within their area of expertise to the enterprise, businesses and other enterprise control functions they support. These groups also work with business and risk executives to develop and guide appropriate strategies, policies, practices, controls and monitoring tools for each business and enterprise control function relative to these programs. Where appropriate, insurance policies are purchased to mitigate the impact of operational losses. These insurance policies are explicitly incorporated in the structural features of operational risk evaluation. As insurance recoveries, especially given recent market events, are subject to legal and financial uncertainty, the inclusion of these insurance policies is subject to reductions in their expected mitigating benefits. Complex Accounting Estimates Our significant accounting principles, as described in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K , are essential in understanding the MD&A. Many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments. The more judgmental estimates impacting results for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 are summarized in the following discussion. We have identified and described the development of the variables most important in the estimation processes that involve mathematical models to derive the estimates. In many cases, there are numerous alternative judgments that could be used in the process of determining the inputs to the models. Where alternatives exist, we have used the factors that we believe represent the most reasonable value in developing the inputs. Actual performance that differs from our estimates of the key variables could impact our results of operations. Separate from the possible future impact to our results of operations from input and model variables, the value of our lending portfolio and market-sensitive assets and liabilities may change subsequent to the balance sheet date, often significantly, due to the nature and magnitude of future credit and market conditions. Such credit and market conditions may change quickly and in unforeseen ways and the resulting volatility could have a significant, negative effect on future operating results. These fluctuations would not be indicative of deficiencies in our models or inputs. For additional information, see Complex Accounting Estimates on page 117 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Fair Value of Financial Instruments We classify the fair values of financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established under applicable accounting guidance which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Applicable accounting guidance establishes three levels of inputs used to measure fair value. For additional information, see Note 14 Fair Value Measurements and Note 15 Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements , and Complex Accounting Estimates on page 117 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K . We do not incorporate a funding valuation or funding benefit adjustment (collectively, FVA) into the fair value of our uncollateralized derivatives. There is diversity in industry practice regarding FVA and such views continue to evolve. We continue to evaluate FVA as it relates to our valuation methodologies used to comply with applicable fair value accounting guidance. 134 Table of Contents Level 3 Assets and Liabilities Financial assets and liabilities where values are based on valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and are significant to the overall fair value measurement are classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy established in applicable accounting guidance. The Level 3 financial assets and liabilities include certain loans, MBS, ABS, CDOs, CLOs and structured liabilities, as well as highly structured, complex or long-dated derivative contracts, private equity investments and consumer MSRs. The fair value of these Level 3 financial assets and liabilities is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. Table 71 Recurring Level 3 Asset and Liability Summary September 30, 2014 December 31, 2013 (Dollars in millions) Level 3 Fair Value As a % of Total Level 3 Assets As a % of Total Assets Level 3 Fair Value As a % of Total Level 3 Assets As a % of Total Assets Trading account assets $ 5,967 25.65 % 0.28 % $ 9,044 28.46 % 0.43 % Derivative assets 6,947 29.86 0.33 7,277 22.90 0.35 AFS debt securities 2,963 12.74 0.14 4,760 14.98 0.23 All other Level 3 assets at fair value 7,389 31.75 0.35 10,697 33.66 0.50 Total Level 3 assets at fair value (1) $ 23,266 100.00 % 1.10 % $ 31,778 100.00 % 1.51 % Level 3 Fair Value As a % of Total Level 3 Liabilities As a % of Total Liabilities Level 3 Fair Value As a % of Total Level 3 Liabilities As a % of Total Liabilities Derivative liabilities $ 7,480 75.84 % 0.40 % $ 7,301 78.20 % 0.39 % Long-term debt 2,349 23.82 0.12 1,990 21.32 0.11 All other Level 3 liabilities at fair value 34 0.34 45 0.48 Total Level 3 liabilities at fair value (1) $ 9,863 100.00 % 0.52 % $ 9,336 100.00 % 0.50 % (1) Level 3 total assets and liabilities are shown before the impact of cash collateral and counterparty netting related to our derivative positions. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 , we recognized net gains of $332 million and net losses of $3 million on Level 3 assets and liabilities. The net gains for the three months ended September 30, 2014 were primarily due to gains on net derivative assets, long-term debt and trading account assets, partially offset by losses on MSRs. The net gains on net derivative assets were primarily due to gains on IRLCs. Gains on long-term debt were due to net gains on equity-linked notes. Gains on trading account assets were primarily due to gains on certain corporate loans and CLOs. Losses on MSRs were primarily due to the impact of the decrease in long-term interest rates on forecasted prepayments. The net losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 were primarily due to losses on MSRs, partially offset by gains on trading account assets. Losses on MSRs and gains on trading account assets were primarily due to the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above. For more information on the components of net realized and unrealized gains and losses during three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 , see Note 14 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Level 3 financial instruments may be hedged with derivatives classified as Level 1 or 2; therefore, gains or losses associated with Level 3 financial instruments may be offset by gains or losses associated with financial instruments classified in other levels of the fair value hierarchy. The Level 3 gains and losses recorded in earnings did not have a significant impact on our liquidity or capital resources. We conduct a review of our fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of Level 3 are made if the significant inputs used in the financial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities became unobservable or observable, respectively, in the current marketplace. These transfers are considered to be effective as of the beginning of the quarter in which they occur. For more information on the significant transfers into and out of Level 3 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 , see Note 14 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements . 135 Table of Contents Goodwill and Intangible Assets Background The nature of and accounting for goodwill and intangible assets are discussed in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 8 Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as Complex Accounting Estimates on page 117 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Goodwill is reviewed for potential impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis, which for the Corporation is as of June 30, and in interim periods if events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below. As reporting units are determined after an acquisition or evolve with changes in business strategy, goodwill is assigned to reporting units and it no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition. All of the revenue streams and related activities of a reporting unit, whether acquired or organic, are available to support the value of the goodwill. For purposes of goodwill impairment testing, the Corporation utilizes allocated equity as a proxy for the carrying value of its reporting units. Allocated equity in the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting unit. The goodwill impairment test involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill, as measured by allocated equity. During the latest annual planning process, the Corporation made refinements to the amount of capital allocated to each of its businesses based on multiple considerations that included, but were not limited to, risk-weighted assets measured under the Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced approaches, business segment exposures and risk profile, and strategic plans. As a result of this process, in 2014, the Corporation adjusted the amount of capital being allocated to its business segments. This change resulted in a reduction of the unallocated capital, which is reflected in All Other , and an aggregate increase to the amount of capital being allocated to the business segments. An increase in allocated capital in the business segments generally results in a reduction of the excess of the fair value over the carrying value and a reduction to the estimated fair value as a percentage of allocated carrying value for an individual reporting unit. 2014 Annual Goodwill Impairment Testing The Corporation's common stock price improved during the first nine months of 2014 ; however, our market capitalization remained below our recorded book value. We estimate that the fair value of all reporting units with assigned goodwill in aggregate as of the June 30, 2014 annual goodwill impairment test was $307.1 billion and the aggregate carrying value of all reporting units with assigned goodwill, as measured by allocated equity, was $175.7 billion. The common stock capitalization of the Corporation as of June 30, 2014 was $161.6 billion ( $179.3 billion at September 30, 2014 ). As none of our reporting units are publicly traded, individual reporting unit fair value determinations do not directly correlate to the Corporation's stock price. Although we believe it is reasonable to conclude that market capitalization could be an indicator of fair value over time, we do not believe that our current market capitalization reflects the aggregate fair value of our individual reporting units. Estimating the fair value of reporting units is a subjective process that involves the use of estimates and judgments, particularly related to cash flows, the appropriate discount rates and an applicable control premium. We determined the fair values of the reporting units using a combination of valuation techniques consistent with the market approach and the income approach and also utilized independent valuation specialists. The market approach we used estimates the fair value of the individual reporting units by incorporating any combination of the tangible capital, book capital and earnings multiples from comparable publicly-traded companies in industries similar to that of the reporting unit. The relative weight assigned to these multiples varies among the reporting units based on qualitative and quantitative characteristics, primarily the size and relative profitability of the reporting unit as compared to the comparable publicly-traded companies. Since the fair values determined under the market approach are representative of a noncontrolling interest, we added a control premium to arrive at the reporting units' estimated fair values on a controlling basis. For purposes of the income approach, we calculated discounted cash flows by taking the net present value of estimated future cash flows and an appropriate terminal value. Our discounted cash flow analysis employs a capital asset pricing model in estimating the discount rate (i.e., cost of equity financing) for each reporting unit. The inputs to this model include the risk-free rate of return, beta, which is a measure of the level of non-diversifiable risk associated with comparable companies for each specific reporting unit, size premium to reflect the historical incremental return on stocks, market equity risk premium and in certain cases an unsystematic (company-specific) risk factor. The unsystematic risk factor is the input that specifically addresses uncertainty related to our projections of earnings and growth, including the uncertainty related to loss expectations. We utilized discount rates that we believe adequately reflect the risk and uncertainty in the financial markets generally and specifically in our internally developed forecasts. We estimated expected rates of equity returns based on historical market returns and risk/return rates for similar industries of each reporting unit. We use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and actual results may differ from forecasted results. 136 Table of Contents During the three months ended September 30, 2014 , we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of June 30, 2014 for all of our reporting units that had goodwill. In performing the first step of the annual goodwill impairment analysis, we compared the fair value of each reporting unit to its estimated carrying value as measured by allocated equity, which includes goodwill. During our 2014 annual goodwill impairment test, we also evaluated the U.K. Card business within All Other, as the U.K. Card business comprises the majority of the goodwill included in All Other. To determine fair value, we utilized a combination of the market approach and the income approach. Under the market approach, we compared earnings and equity multiples of the individual reporting units to multiples of public companies comparable to the individual reporting units. The control premium used in the June 30, 2014 annual goodwill impairment test was 30 percent for all reporting units. Under the income approach, we updated our assumptions to reflect the current market environment. The discount rates used in the June 30, 2014 annual goodwill impairment test ranged from 10.5 percent to 13 percent depending on the relative risk of a reporting unit. Growth rates developed by management for individual revenue and expense items in each reporting unit ranged from (2.9) percent to 8.5 percent. Based on the results of step one of the annual goodwill impairment test, we determined that step two was not required for any of the reporting units as their fair value exceeded their carrying value indicating there was no impairment. The fair value for Card Services as of June 30, 2014 no longer considers the negative impact of a July 31, 2013 court ruling regarding the Federal Reserve's rules on debit card interchange fees, which would have required the Federal Reserve to reconsider the cap on debit card interchange fees. The fair value as of June 30, 2013 considered that potential negative impact contributing to an estimated fair value as a percent of allocated carrying value of 120.3 percent. On March 21, 2014, the Federal Reserve appealed and reversed the court's ruling. On August 18, 2014, the merchant plaintiffs filed a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court to review the court's decision. The U.S. Supreme Court has not yet indicated whether it will review the decision. Table 72 shows goodwill assigned to the individual reporting units and the fair value as a percentage of the carrying value as of our June 30, 2014 annual goodwill impairment test. Table 72 Goodwill by Reporting Unit (1) June 30, 2014 (Dollars in millions) Estimated Fair Value as a Percent of Allocated Carrying Value Goodwill Consumer & Business Banking Deposits 131.2 % $ 17,875 Card Services 155.2 10,014 Business Banking 142.5 2,097 Dealer Financial Services 112.5 1,695 Global Wealth & Investment Management U.S. Trust 203.0 2,922 Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management 362.4 6,776 Global Banking Global Commercial Banking 154.6 16,146 Global Corporate and Investment Banking 188.4 6,231 Global Markets 159.5 5,197 All Other (2) 208.5 775 (1) There was no goodwill in CRES at June 30, 2014 . (2) Reflects the goodwill and estimated fair value as a percent of allocated carrying value assigned to the U.K. Card business within All Other . The total amount of goodwill in All Other was $857 million at June 30, 2014 . In estimating the fair value of the reporting units in step one of the annual goodwill impairment analysis, the fair values can be sensitive to changes in the projected cash flows and assumptions. In some instances, minor changes in the assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value. Furthermore, a prolonged decrease or increase in a particular assumption could eventually lead to the fair value of a reporting unit being less than its carrying value. Also, under step two of the annual goodwill impairment analysis, which was not required for any of our reporting units at June 30, 2014, changes in the estimated fair values of the individual assets and liabilities may result in a different amount of implied goodwill, and ultimately the amount of goodwill impairment, if any. 137 Table of Contents Glossary Alt-A Mortgage A type of U.S. mortgage that, for various reasons, is considered riskier than A-paper, or "prime," and less risky than "subprime," the riskiest category. Alt-A interest rates, which are determined by credit risk, therefore tend to be between those of prime and subprime home loans. Typically, Alt-A mortgages are characterized by borrowers with less than full documentation, lower credit scores and higher LTVs. Assets in Custody Consist largely of custodial and non-discretionary trust assets excluding brokerage assets administered for clients. Trust assets encompass a broad range of asset types including real estate, private company ownership interest, personal property and investments. Assets Under Management (AUM) The total market value of assets under the investment advisory and discretion of GWIM which generate asset management fees based on a percentage of the assets' market values. AUM reflects assets that are generally managed for institutional, high net worth and retail clients, and are distributed through various investment products including mutual funds, other commingled vehicles and separate accounts. Carrying Value (with respect to loans) The amount at which a loan is recorded on the balance sheet. For loans recorded at amortized cost, carrying value is the unpaid principal balance net of unamortized deferred loan origination fees and costs, and unamortized purchase premium or discount. For loans that are or have been on nonaccrual status, the carrying value is also reduced by any net charge-offs that have been recorded and the amount of interest payments applied as a reduction of principal under the cost recovery method. For PCI loans, the carrying value equals fair value upon acquisition adjusted for subsequent cash collections and yield accreted to date. For credit card loans, the carrying value also includes interest that has been billed to the customer. For loans classified as held-for-sale, carrying value is the lower of carrying value as described in the sentences above, or fair value. For loans for which we have elected the fair value option, the carrying value is fair value. Client Brokerage Assets Include client assets which are held in brokerage accounts. This includes non-discretionary brokerage and fee-based assets which generate brokerage income and asset management fee revenue. Committed Credit Exposure Includes any funded portion of a facility plus the unfunded portion of a facility on which the lender is legally bound to advance funds during a specified period under prescribed conditions. Credit Derivatives Contractual agreements that provide protection against a credit event on one or more referenced obligations. The nature of a credit event is established by the protection purchaser and protection seller at the inception of the transaction, and such events generally include bankruptcy or insolvency of the referenced credit entity, failure to meet payment obligations when due, as well as acceleration of indebtedness and payment repudiation or moratorium. The purchaser of the credit derivative pays a periodic fee in return for a payment by the protection seller upon the occurrence, if any, of such a credit event. A credit default swap is a type of a credit derivative. Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) A portfolio adjustment required to properly reflect the counterparty credit risk exposure as part of the fair value of derivative instruments. Debit Valuation Adjustment (DVA) A portfolio adjustment required to properly reflect the Corporation's own credit risk exposure as part of the fair value of derivative instruments and/or structured liabilities. Interest Rate Lock Commitment (IRLC) Commitment with a loan applicant in which the loan terms, including interest rate and price, are guaranteed for a designated period of time subject to credit approval. Letter of Credit A document issued on behalf of a customer to a third party promising to pay the third party upon presentation of specified documents. A letter of credit effectively substitutes the issuer's credit for that of the customer. Loan-to-value (LTV) A commonly used credit quality metric that is reported in terms of ending and average LTV. Ending LTV is calculated as the outstanding carrying value of the loan at the end of the period divided by the estimated value of the property securing the loan. Estimated property values are primarily determined by utilizing the Case-Schiller Home Index, a widely used index based on data from repeat sales of single family homes. Case-Schiller indices are updated quarterly and are reported on a three-month or one-quarter lag. An additional metric related to LTV is combined loan-to-value (CLTV) which is similar to the LTV metric, yet combines the outstanding balance on the residential mortgage loan and the outstanding carrying value on the home equity loan or available line of credit, both of which are secured by the same property, divided by the estimated value of the property. An LTV of 100 percent reflects a loan that is currently secured by a property valued at an amount exactly equal to the carrying value or available line of the loan. Under certain circumstances, estimated values can also be determined by utilizing an automated valuation method (AVM) or Mortgage Risk 138 Table of Contents Assessment Corporation (MRAC) index. An AVM is a tool that estimates the value of a property by reference to large volumes of market data including sales of comparable properties and price trends specific to the MSA in which the property being valued is located. The MRAC index is similar to the Case-Schiller Home Index in that it is an index that is based on data from repeat sales of single family homes and is reported on a lag. Margin Receivable An extension of credit secured by eligible securities in certain brokerage accounts. Matched Book Repurchase and resale agreements and securities borrowed and loaned transactions entered into to accommodate customers and earn interest rate spreads. Mortgage Servicing Right (MSR) The right to service a mortgage loan when the underlying loan is sold or securitized. Servicing includes collections for principal, interest and escrow payments from borrowers and accounting for and remitting principal and interest payments to investors. Net Interest Yield Net interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets. Nonperforming Loans and Leases Includes loans and leases that have been placed on nonaccrual status, including nonaccruing loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties (TDRs). Loans accounted for under the fair value option, PCI loans and LHFS are not reported as nonperforming loans and leases. Consumer credit card loans, business card loans, consumer loans secured by personal property (except for certain secured consumer loans, including those that have been modified in a TDR), and consumer loans secured by real estate that are insured by the FHA or through long-term credit protection agreements with FNMA and FHLMC (fully-insured loan portfolio) are not placed on nonaccrual status and are, therefore, not reported as nonperforming loans and leases. Purchased Credit-impaired (PCI) Loan A loan purchased as an individual loan, in a portfolio of loans or in a business combination with evidence of deterioration in credit quality since origination for which it is probable, upon acquisition, that the investor will be unable to collect all contractually required payments. These loans are recorded at fair value upon acquisition. Subprime Loans Although a standard industry definition for subprime loans (including subprime mortgage loans) does not exist, the Corporation defines subprime loans as specific product offerings for higher risk borrowers, including individuals with one or a combination of high credit risk factors, such as low FICO scores, high debt to income ratios and inferior payment history. Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs) Loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. Certain consumer loans for which a binding offer to restructure has been extended are also classified as TDRs. Concessions could include a reduction in the interest rate to a rate that is below market on the loan, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance, loans discharged in bankruptcy or other actions intended to maximize collection. Secured consumer loans that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not been reaffirmed by the borrower are classified as TDRs at the time of discharge from bankruptcy. TDRs are generally reported as nonperforming loans and leases while on nonaccrual status. Nonperforming TDRs may be returned to accrual status when, among other criteria, payment in full of all amounts due under the restructured terms is expected and the borrower has demonstrated a sustained period of repayment performance, generally six months. TDRs that are on accrual status are reported as performing TDRs through the end of the calendar year in which the restructuring occurred or the year in which they are returned to accrual status. In addition, if accruing TDRs bear less than a market rate of interest at the time of modification, they are reported as performing TDRs throughout their remaining lives unless and until they cease to perform in accordance with their modified contractual terms, at which time they would be placed on nonaccrual status and reported as nonperforming TDRs. Value-at-Risk (VaR) VaR is a model that simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of hypothetical scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR represents the loss the portfolio is expected to experience with a given confidence level based on historical data. A VaR model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of potential gains and losses on our trading portfolios. 139 Table of Contents Acronyms ABS Asset-backed securities AFS Available-for-sale ALM Asset and liability management ALMRC Asset Liability and Market Risk Committee ARM Adjustable-rate mortgage BHC Bank holding company CCAR Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review CDO Collateralized debt obligation CLO Collateralized loan obligation CRA Community Reinvestment Act CRC Credit Risk Committee EAD Exposure at default FDIC Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FHA Federal Housing Administration FHLMC Freddie Mac FICC Fixed income, currencies and commodities FICO Fair Isaac Corporation (credit score) FNMA Fannie Mae FTE Fully taxable-equivalent GAAP Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GMRC Global Markets Risk Committee GNMA Government National Mortgage Association GSE Government-sponsored enterprise HELOC Home equity lines of credit HFI Held-for-investment HUD U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development LCR Liquidity Coverage Ratio LGD Loss-given default LHFS Loans held-for-sale LIBOR London InterBank Offered Rate MBS Mortgage-backed securities MD&A Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MI Mortgage insurance MSA Metropolitan statistical area NSFR Net Stable Funding Ratio OCC Office of the Comptroller of the Currency OCI Other comprehensive income OTC Over-the-counter OTTI Other-than-temporary impairment PPI Payment protection insurance RMBS Residential mortgage-backed securities SBLCs Standby letters of credit SEC Securities and Exchange Commission VA U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs VIE Variable interest entity 140 Table of Contents
