2014 FINANCIAL REVIEW

 

FINANCIAL REVIEW

The financial section of American Express Company’s Annual Report consists of this Financial Review, the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following discussion is designed to provide perspective and understanding regarding the consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Certain key terms are defined in the “Glossary of Selected Terminology”.

When we use the terms “American Express,” “the Company,” “we,” “our” or “us,” we mean American Express Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, unless we state or the context implies otherwise.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

BUSINESS INTRODUCTION

We are a global services company with four reportable operating segments: U.S. Card Services (USCS), International Card Services (ICS), Global Commercial Services (GCS) and Global Network and Merchant Services (GNMS). We provide our customers with access to products, insights and experiences that enrich lives and build business success. Our principal products and services are charge and credit payment card products and travel-related services offered to consumers and businesses around the world. After June 30, 2014, business travel-related services are offered through the non-consolidated joint venture, American Express Global Business Travel (GBT JV). Until June 30, 2014, the business travel operations were wholly owned. Our range of products and services includes:

 

•	 	
charge and credit card products;

 

•	 	
expense management products and services;

 

•	 	
travel-related services;

 

•	 	
stored-value/prepaid products;

 

•	 	
network services;

 

•	 	
merchant acquisition and processing, servicing and settlement, and point-of-sale, marketing and information products and services for merchants; and

 

•	 	
fee services, including fraud prevention services and the design of customized customer loyalty and rewards programs.

Our products and services are sold globally to diverse customer groups, including consumers, small businesses, mid-sized companies and large corporations. These products and services are sold through various channels, including direct mail, online applications, in-house and third-party sales forces and direct response advertising.

We compete in the global payments industry with charge, credit and debit card networks, issuers and acquirers, as well as evolving alternative payment providers. As the payments industry continues to evolve, we face increasing competition from non-traditional players that leverage new technologies and customers’ existing accounts and relationships to create payment or other fee-based solutions. We are transforming our existing businesses and creating new products and services for the digital marketplace as we seek to enhance our customers’ digital experiences and develop platforms for online and mobile commerce.

Our products and services generate the following types of revenue for the Company:

 

•	 	
Discount revenue, our largest revenue source, which represents fees generally charged to merchants when Card Members use their cards to purchase goods and services at merchants on our network;

 

•	 	
Net card fees, which represent revenue earned from annual card membership fees;

 

•	 	
Travel commissions and fees, which are earned by charging a transaction or management fee to both customers and suppliers for travel-related transactions (business travel commissions and fees included through June 30, 2014);

 

•	 	
Other commissions and fees, which are earned on foreign exchange conversions, card-related fees and assessments, Loyalty Partner-related fees and other service fees;

 

•	 	
Other revenue, which represents revenues arising from contracts with partners of our Global Network Services (GNS) business (including commissions and signing fees), insurance premiums earned from Card Member travel and other insurance programs, prepaid card-related revenues, revenues related to the GBT JV transition services agreement, earnings from equity method investments (including the GBT JV) and other miscellaneous revenue and fees; and

FINANCIAL TARGETS

We seek to achieve three financial targets, on average and over time:

 

•	 	
Earnings per share (EPS) growth of 12 to 15 percent;

 

•	 	
Revenues net of interest expense growth of at least 8 percent; and

 

•	 	
Return on average equity (ROE) of 25 percent or more.

If we achieve our EPS and ROE targets, we will seek to return on average and over time approximately 50 percent of the capital we generate to shareholders as dividends or through the repurchases of common stock, which may be subject to certain regulatory restrictions as described herein. See “Current Business Environment/Outlook” for a discussion of certain factors regarding our ability to achieve our financial targets.

2014 FINANCIAL REVIEW

 

CURRENT BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT/OUTLOOK

Our results for 2014 reflect higher spending by our Card Members, growth in average Card Member loans, credit quality indicators at or near historical lows and continued control over operating expenses, while our strong balance sheet allowed us to return a substantial amount of capital to our shareholders. We believe we produced solid earnings given the current economic and competitive environment, but recognize we face a number of increasing challenges in 2015.

In 2014, we exceeded $1 trillion in annual Card Member global spend on our network for the first time. Card Member billed business increased 7 percent annually over the prior year, with a modest deceleration of the growth rate in the fourth quarter. Discount revenue increased 4 percent annually over the prior year. Billed business growth outpaced discount revenue growth primarily due to accelerated growth of our GNS business (where we share discount revenue we earn from merchants with our issuing bank partners), certain contract signings and payments made to corporate clients and merchant partners, strong growth in our cash rebate rewards products and changes in the mix of spending by location and industry. These factors as well as competition and pricing regulation (including regulation of competitors’ interchange rates) will likely result in a continuation of this trend over time.

Average loans grew 4 percent during 2014, which, along with lower funding costs, led to an 8 percent increase in net interest income. Net write-off rates remained at or near historically low levels, though the overall rate of improvement slowed in 2014. We expect, at some point, net write-off rates will increase from these historic lows, which will result in a growth in provision for losses assuming average loans remain at or above current levels.

As previously noted, our 2014 results include net gains from the business travel joint venture transaction in the second quarter ($626 million pretax) and the sale of our investment in Concur in the fourth quarter ($719 million pretax). We used a substantial portion of those gains to make additional investments in business building activities and initiatives designed to improve operating efficiencies. Specifically, marketing, promotion and rewards expenses reflect incremental investments, as well as a charge related to the renewal of our long-term relationship with Delta. We also undertook restructuring actions in the second quarter ($133 million pretax) and fourth quarter ($313 million pretax) designed to make us more efficient, contain operating expenses, and, as a result, better enable us to invest in new and enhanced products and services.

Operating expenses for the year decreased 6 percent and adjusted operating expenses, a non-GAAP measure, were flat year over year. Refer to Table 1 for details of adjusted operating expenses.

While our business is diversified by product and geography, including a range of consumer and commercial card offerings, a large international business and GNS partners around the world, we face a number of increasing challenges in 2015.

Regulation of the payments industry has increased significantly in recent years and various governments around the world have established or are proposing to establish payment system regulatory regimes. In the European Union (EU), proposed regulatory changes in the card payment sector, including the introduction of price regulation, the elimination of honor-all-cards and “anti-steering” rules, and requirements on granting access to our network, among other important changes, will likely negatively impact the discount revenue derived from our business in the EU and could significantly limit our flexibility to compete with the more entrenched bankcard networks. See ‘‘Certain Legislative, Regulatory and Other Developments” for additional information on the legislative and regulatory environment.

In addition, global economic growth continues at a modest and mixed pace. Our 2014 results were negatively impacted by the strengthening U.S. dollar, and we currently expect foreign exchange to have an adverse impact in 2015. Our results could be adversely affected by increases in short-term interest rates or the failure of the U.S. Congress to continue the renewal of legislation regarding our active financing income, which could increase our effective tax rate and have an adverse impact on net income in 2015 and beyond.

Competition remains extremely intense across the payments industry. Within the co-brand space, we are focusing on those relationships that offer the best value to our Card Members while also providing appropriate returns to our business and shareholders. We recently renewed and extended our relationships with Delta, Starwood and Cathay Pacific. More intense competition has generally increased our cost of renewing and extending co-brand relationships which are an important component of our business model. We will continue to strive for a diverse and balanced portfolio of product categories.

2014 FINANCIAL REVIEW

 

As announced on February 12, 2015, we sought to renew our co-brand and merchant acceptance agreements with Costco in the United States, a substantial and growing business relationship. We were unable to agree to terms that would have provided attractive returns for our Company and our shareholders compared to alternative investments. U.S. Costco co-brand accounts generated approximately 8 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended December 31, 2014. Over 70 percent of the spending on these accounts occurred outside Costco warehouses. As of December 31, 2014, these co-brand accounts were responsible for approximately 20 percent of our worldwide Card Member loans and approximately 10 percent of our total cards-in-force. In addition, 1 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended December 31, 2014 came from spending on other American Express cards at Costco warehouses. Our current co-brand and merchant acceptance agreements with Costco are set to expire on March 31, 2016. The term of any sale of the existing Costco U.S. Card Member loan portfolio will depend on a series of decisions and negotiations among Costco, us and the new co-brand card issuers.

We intend to make investments to attract Card Members, including those from the Costco co-brand relationship, by offering them attractive products from our suite of proprietary offerings. We will also be making investments in other growth initiatives across our Company that we believe offer more attractive returns over time and position us for continued long-term growth. We believe having greater certainty regarding our existing co-brand relationships gives us more flexibility to invest in growth opportunities in the co-brand space and across our Company to help us drive innovation in the world of payments and commerce.

At the same time, we are prepared to re-scale our overall cost base so that it is appropriately sized, which could include a restructuring charge in the future and help us to maintain discipline over operating expenses in 2015 and 2016. The timing and size of any restructuring charge will be dependent on a number of factors, including whether there is a portfolio sale as well as the rate the billed business associated with the Costco U.S. co-brand portfolio declines and how quickly we can grow billed business with other products.

The cumulative effect of increased competition and pricing regulation, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, the expiration of our U.S. Costco co-brand relationship in 2016 and other factors previously discussed leads us to expect earnings per share in 2015 will likely be significantly adversely affected year over year as we manage through these near-term challenges and invest aggressively to prepare for the end of the Costco U.S. relationship. The impact of these challenges in 2016 will depend on factors such as our ability to offer attractive products and services to Card Members, grow other sources of revenue and implement expense control initiatives, although there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful. We are confident in our business model and believe our financial targets remain appropriate over the longer term once our year over year results are not impacted by the loss of Costco or the renewal of our other co-brand partner relationships.

On February 19, 2015, a trial court ruled in favor of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) in a case challenging provisions in our card acceptance agreements with merchants that prohibit merchants from discriminating against our card products at the point of sale. See “Certain Legislative, Regulatory and Other Developments” for information on the potential impacts of an adverse decision on our business.

(c)	Return on average tangible common equity, a non-GAAP measure, is computed in the same manner as ROE except the computation of average tangible common equity, a non-GAAP measure, excludes from average total shareholders’ equity, average goodwill and other intangibles of $3.9 billion, $4.1 billion and $4.2 billion as of December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and preferred shares of $0.7 billion as of December 31, 2014. We believe return on average tangible common equity is a useful measure of the profitability of our business.

TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE

Discount revenue increased $798 million or 4 percent in 2014 as compared to 2013, and $956 million or 5 percent in 2013 as compared to 2012. The increase in both years was driven by a 7 percent growth in billed business volumes, partially offset by a decline in the average discount rate, faster growth in GNS billings than in overall Company billings, and increased cash rebate rewards and corporate client incentives. U.S. billed business and billed business outside the U.S. increased 8 percent and 6 percent, respectively, in 2014 as compared to 2013, due to increases in average spending per proprietary basic card and basic cards-in-force. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates billed business outside the U.S. increased 10 percent. See Tables 6 and 7 for more detail on billed business performance. The average discount rate was 2.48 percent, 2.51 percent and 2.52 percent for 2014, 2013 and 2012 respectively. Changes in the mix of spending by location and industry, volume-related pricing discounts, strategic investments, certain pricing initiatives, competition, pricing regulation (including regulation of competitors’ interchange rates) and other factors will likely result in continued erosion of the average discount rate over time.

Net card fees increased $81 million or 3 percent in 2014 as compared to 2013, and $125 million or 5 percent in 2013 as compared to 2012. The increase in both years was primarily driven by higher average proprietary cards-in-force and higher average card fees in ICS and USCS. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, net card fees increased 5 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 and 8 percent in 2013 compared to 2012.1

 

1  	The foreign currency adjusted information, a non-GAAP measure, assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into U.S. dollars (i.e., assumes the foreign exchange rates used to determine results for the current year apply to the corresponding year period against which such results are being compared). We believe the presentation of information on a foreign currency adjusted basis is helpful to investors by making it easier to compare our performance in one period to that of another period without the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

Travel commissions and fees decreased $795 million or 42 percent in 2014 as compared to 2013, and $27 million or 1 percent in 2013 as compared to 2012. The decrease in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to the business travel joint venture transaction, resulting in a lack of comparability between periods. The decrease in 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily driven by flat business travel sales and a 2 percent decline in U.S. consumer travel sales.

Other commissions and fees increased $94 million or 4 percent in 2014 as compared to 2013, and $97 million or 4 percent in 2013 as compared to 2012. The increase in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily driven by higher revenue from our Loyalty Partner business and delinquency fees. The increase in 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily driven by lower Card Member reimbursements and marginally higher delinquency fees and foreign currency conversion revenues, as well as higher revenue from our Loyalty Partner business.

Other revenues increased $715 million or 31 percent in 2014 as compared to 2013 and decreased $151 million or 6 percent in 2013 as compared to 2012. The increase in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily driven by the $719 million gain on the sale of our investment in Concur, revenues received for transitional services provided to the GBT JV and higher Loyalty Edge revenues, partially offset by the loss of revenue from the publishing business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2013. The decrease in 2013 as compared to 2012 was driven by the effect of a benefit in the first half of 2012 due to revised estimates of the liability for uncashed Travelers Cheques in certain international countries. The 2013 decrease also includes the loss of revenue from the publishing business in the fourth quarter of 2013, and higher Card Member reimbursements within other revenues in 2013 as compared to 2012. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in Loyalty Edge revenue from additional client signings and a larger gain on the sale of investment securities in 2013.

Interest income increased $174 million or 2 percent in 2014 as compared to 2013, and $151 million or 2 percent in 2013 as compared to 2012. The increase in both years was primarily due to an increase in interest on loans driven by higher average Card Member loans, partially offset by decreases in interest and dividends on investment securities driven by lower average investment securities.

Interest expense decreased $251 million or 13 percent in 2014 as compared to 2013, and $268 million or 12 percent in 2013 as compared to 2012. The decrease in both years was primarily driven by a lower cost of funds on debt and customer deposits, partially offset by increases in average customer deposit balances. The decrease in 2013 was also driven by lower average long-term debt balances.

PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES

Charge card provision for losses increased $144 million or 22 percent in 2014 as compared to 2013, and $47 million or 8 percent in 2013 as compared to 2012. The increase in 2014 was primarily due to a slower reserve rate improvement in 2014 versus 2013, higher corporate card write-offs and the effects of changes in other loss reserve assumptions resulting in a reserve build versus a reserve release in 2013. The 2013 increase was driven by higher average Card Member receivable balances resulting in higher net write-offs, partially offset by a higher reserve release in 2013 than 2012.

Card Member loans provision for losses increased $23 million or 2 percent in 2014 as compared to 2013, and $85 million or 8 percent in 2013 as compared to 2012. The increase in 2014 was driven by higher average Card Member loans, a slower improvement in the reserve rate and the effects of changes in other loss reserve assumptions resulting in a lower reserve release as compared to 2013, partially offset by the benefit of lower net write-offs due to improved credit performance. The 2013 increase was primarily driven by lower reserve releases as compared to 2012, partially offset by the benefit of lower net write-offs in 2013 due to improved credit performance.

Other provision for losses increased $45 million or 65 percent in 2014 as compared to 2013, and decreased $12 million or 15 percent in 2013 as compared to 2012. The increase in 2014 was due, in part, to a merchant-related charge in the fourth quarter of 2014.

EXPENSES

Marketing and promotion expenses increased $277 million or 9 percent in 2014 as compared to 2013, and $153 million or 5 percent in 2013 as compared to 2012. The increase in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily driven by the reinvestment of a portion of the gains from the business travel joint venture transaction and the sale of our investment in Concur in growth initiatives. The 2013 increase as compared to 2012 was driven by higher spend on Card Member acquisition marketing.

Card Member rewards expenses increased $474 million or 7 percent in 2014 as compared to 2013, and $175 million or 3 percent in 2013 as compared to 2012. The increase in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to higher Membership Rewards expense of $263 million, driven by a $266 million increase related to new points earned, in line with higher spending volumes, and a higher weighted average cost (WAC) per point assumption, including the impact of the $109 million charge related to the Delta partnership renewal in the fourth quarter of 2014; these increases were offset by slower average growth in the Ultimate Redemption Rate (URR). Co-brand rewards expense increased $211 million, primarily driven by higher spending volumes.

The 2013 increase in Card Member rewards expenses was driven by higher co-brand rewards expenses of $283 million, primarily relating to higher spending volumes, partially offset by a decrease in Membership Rewards expenses of $108 million. The decrease in Membership Rewards expenses was primarily driven by a $208 million decrease related to the liability for points earned but not yet redeemed, including the impact of a 2012 charge related to enhancements made to the U.S. URR estimation process of $342 million, partially offset by a net increase in expenses related to slower average declines in the WAC per point assumption and slower average growth in the URR as compared to 2012. The $208 million decrease was partially offset by an increase in expense related to new points earned of $100 million.

The Membership Rewards URR for current program participants was 95 percent (rounded up) at December 31, 2014, an increase from 94 percent (rounded down) at December 31, 2013 and 94 percent (rounded up) at December 31, 2012. The increases in the URR were driven by greater engagement in our Membership Rewards program.

Card Member services expenses increased $55 million or 7 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 and decreased $5 million or 1 percent in 2013 as compared to 2012. The increase in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily driven by increased engagement levels and use of certain Card Member benefits, as well as recently opened American Express-branded airport lounges.

Salaries and employee benefits expenses decreased $96 million or 2 percent in 2014 as compared to 2013, and $406 million or 6 percent in 2013 as compared to 2012. The decrease in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to the business travel joint venture transaction, resulting in a lack of comparability between periods. This decrease was partially offset by restructuring charges in the second and fourth quarters of 2014. The decrease in 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily driven by a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 2012.

Other expenses decreased $707 million or 10 percent in 2014 as compared to 2013, and $55 million or 1 percent in 2013 as compared to 2012. The decrease in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily driven by the business travel joint venture transaction, which resulted in a gain in the second quarter of 2014 and a lack of comparability between periods beginning in the third quarter of 2014, and the proposed merchant litigation settlement in 2013. The decrease was also due to lower professional services and occupancy and equipment expenses in 2014. These benefits were partially offset by higher fraud expense and non-income tax items in 2014, as well as the American Express Foundation contribution in the second quarter of 2014. The 2013 decrease was driven by higher Card Member reimbursements and investment impairments in 2012, partially offset by higher professional services expenses, driven by increased investments in technology development and other investments in the business, as well as higher occupancy and equipment expenses, primarily driven by higher data processing expenses as well as the proposed merchant litigation settlement in the fourth quarter of 2013.

INCOME TAXES

The effective tax rate was 34.5 percent in 2014 compared to 32.1 percent in 2013 and 30.5 percent in 2012. The tax rates for 2014 and 2013 included expenses of $40 million and benefits of $150 million, respectively, related to the resolution of certain prior years’ items. The tax rate for 2012 included benefits of $146 million related to the realization of certain foreign tax credits. The tax rates in all years reflect the level of pretax income in relation to recurring permanent tax benefits and variances in the geographic mix of business.

(a)	Average basic Card Member spending and average fee per card are computed from proprietary card activities only. Average fee per card is computed based on net card fees, including the amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs divided by average worldwide proprietary cards-in-force. The adjusted average fee per card, which is a non-GAAP measure, is computed in the same manner, but excludes amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs. The amount of amortization excluded was $306 million, $262 million and $257 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We present adjusted average fee per card because we believe this metric presents a useful indicator of card fee pricing across a range of its proprietary card products.

(a)	The foreign currency adjusted information assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into U.S. dollars (i.e., assumes the foreign exchange rates used to determine results for the current year apply to the corresponding year-earlier period against which such results are being compared). We believe the presentation of information on a foreign currency adjusted basis is helpful to investors by making it easier to compare our performance in one period to that of another period without the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
(b)	Captions in the table above not designated as “proprietary” or “GNS” include both proprietary and GNS data.
(c)	Included in the GNMS segment.

(a)	Provisions for principal (resulting from authorized transactions), interest and/or fees on Card Member loans and principal (resulting from authorized transactions) and fee reserve components on Card Member receivables.
(b)	Write-offs, less recoveries.
(c)	Card Member receivables includes a reclassification of card-related fraud losses of $(7) million to other liabilities in 2014; foreign currency translation adjustments of $(15) million, $(4) million and $2 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively; a reclassification of Card Member bankruptcy reserves of $18 million from other liabilities to credit reserves in 2012; and other adjustments of $(8) million, $(17) million and $9 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Card Member loans includes a reclassification of card-related fraud losses of $(6) million to other liabilities in 2014; foreign currency translation adjustments of $(17) million, $(12) million and $7 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively; a reclassification of Card Member bankruptcy reserves of $4 million from other liabilities to credit reserves in 2012; and other adjustments of $12 million and $(22) million and $(7) million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
(d)	Historically, net loss ratio as a % of charge volume and 90 days past billing as a % of receivables were presented for ICS. Beginning in the first quarter 2014, as a result of system enhancements, 30 days past due as a % of total, net write-off rate (principal only) and net write-off rate (principal and fees) have been presented.
(e)	We present a net write-off rate based on principal losses only (i.e., excluding interest and/or fees) to be consistent with industry convention. In addition, because our practice is to include uncollectible interest and/or fees as part of our total provision for losses, a net write-off rate including principal, interest and/or fees is also presented.
(f)	Refer to Table 9 for the calculation of net interest yield on Card Member loans, a non-GAAP measure, net interest income divided by average loans, a GAAP measure, and our rationale for presenting net interest yield on Card Member loans.

(a)	Adjusted average loans, adjusted net interest income and net interest yield on Card Member loans are non-GAAP measures.

2014 FINANCIAL REVIEW

 

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS OVERVIEW

We consider a combination of factors when evaluating the composition of our reportable operating segments, including the results reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, economic characteristics, products and services offered, classes of customers, product distribution channels, geographic considerations (primarily U.S. versus non-U.S.) and regulatory considerations. Refer to Note 25 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of the products and services by segment.

Results of the business segments essentially treat each segment as a stand-alone business. The management reporting process that derives these results allocates revenue and expense using various methodologies as described below.

Refer to the “Glossary of Selected Terminology” for the definitions of certain key terms and related information appearing in this section.

TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE

We allocate discount revenue and certain other revenues among segments using a transfer pricing methodology. Within the USCS, ICS and GCS segments, discount revenue generally reflects the issuer component of the overall discount revenue generated by each segment’s Card Members; within the GNMS segment, discount revenue generally reflects the network and acquirer component of the overall discount revenue. Net card fees and travel commissions and fees are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported.

Interest and fees on loans and certain investment income is directly attributable to the segment in which it is reported. Interest expense represents an allocated funding cost based on a combination of segment funding requirements and internal funding rates.

PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES

The provisions for losses are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported.

EXPENSES

Marketing and promotion expenses are included in each segment based on actual expenses incurred, with the exception of brand advertising, which is primarily reflected in the GNMS and USCS segments. Rewards and Card Member services expenses are included in each segment based on actual expenses incurred within each segment.

Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses reflect expenses such as professional services, occupancy and equipment and communications incurred directly within each segment. In addition, expenses related to support services, such as technology costs, are allocated to each segment primarily based on support service activities directly attributable to the segment. Other overhead expenses, such as staff group support functions, are allocated from Corporate & Other to the other segments based on a mix of each segment’s direct consumption of services and relative level of pretax income.

CAPITAL

Each business segment is allocated capital based on established business model operating requirements, risk measures and regulatory capital requirements. Business model operating requirements reflect capital needed to support operations and specific balance sheet items. The risk measures reflect considerations for credit, market and operational risk.

INCOME TAXES

An income tax provision (benefit) is allocated to each business segment based on the effective tax rates applicable to various businesses that comprise the segment.

USCS issues a wide range of card products and services to consumers and small businesses in the U.S., and provides consumer travel services to Card Members and other consumers.

TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE

Discount revenue, net card fees and other revenues increased $609 million or 5 percent in 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily driven by higher discount revenue, due to billed business growth, partially offset by a decrease in the average discount rate and higher cash rebate rewards. Billed business increased 8 percent in 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily driven by a 4 percent increase in average spending per proprietary basic card and 4 percent higher cards-in-force.

Interest income increased $221 million or 4 percent in 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily driven by higher average Card Member loans, partially offset by higher Card Member reimbursements. Interest expense decreased $89 million or 13 percent in 2014 as compared to 2013, due to lower funding costs.

Total revenues net of interest expense increased $949 million or 6 percent in 2013 as compared to 2012, primarily driven by higher discount revenue, due to 8 percent growth in billed business and increased net interest income.

PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES

Provisions for losses increased $146 million or 12 percent in 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily due to higher average Card Member loans, a slower improvement in the reserve rate, and the effects of changes in other loss reserve assumptions resulting in a lower reserve release in 2014, partially offset by the benefit of lower net write-offs for Card Member loans due to improved credit performance. Provisions for losses decreased $3 million in 2013 as compared to 2012.

Refer to Table 11 for the lending and charge card write-off rates for 2014, 2013 and 2012.

EXPENSES

Marketing, promotion, rewards and Card Member services and other expenses increased $476 million or 7 percent in 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily driven by a $397 million or 8 percent increase in Card Member rewards expenses. The increase in rewards costs was driven by higher co-brand rewards expenses of $203 million, primarily relating to higher spending volumes, and an increase in Membership Rewards expense of $194 million. The increase in Membership Rewards expense was primarily due to higher new points earned and a higher WAC per point assumption, including the impact of a $96 million charge related to the Delta partnership renewal in the fourth quarter of 2014.

Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses increased $191 million or 5 percent in 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily driven by higher card-related fraud losses, a change in the estimated value of certain investments in our Community Reinvestment Act portfolio and higher restructuring charges compared to 2013.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY

2014 FINANCIAL REVIEW

 

Total expenses increased $27 million in 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily driven by higher marketing and promotion expenses and rewards costs. The increase in Card Member rewards was driven by higher co-brand rewards expenses, substantially offset by the impact of a $317 million expense in 2012 related to enhancements to the U.S. URR estimation process. These increases were largely offset by lower Card Member reimbursement costs in 2013 and the impact of the restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 2012.

INCOME TAXES

The tax rate in all periods includes the benefits from the resolution of certain prior years’ tax items and the relationship of recurring permanent tax benefits to varying levels of pretax income.

(a)	Return on average segment capital is calculated by dividing (i) one-year period segment income ($3.2 billion, $3.2 billion and $2.6 billion for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively) by (ii) one-year average segment capital ($9.8 billion for 2014, and $9.0 billion for both 2013 and 2012). Return on average tangible segment capital, a non-GAAP measure, is computed in the same manner as return on average segment capital except the computation of average tangible segment capital, a non-GAAP measure, excludes from average segment capital average goodwill and other intangibles of $319 million, $334 million and $379 million as of December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We believe return on average tangible segment capital is a useful measure of the profitability of our business.
(b)	Refer to Table 8 footnote (e).
(c)	Adjusted net interest income, adjusted average loans and net interest yield on Card Member loans are non-GAAP measures. Refer to “Glossary of Selected Terminology” for the definitions of these terms. We believe adjusted net interest income and adjusted average loans are useful to investors because they are components of net interest yield on Card Member loans, which provides a measure of profitability of our Card Member loan portfolio.

TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE

Discount revenue, net card fees and other revenues increased $93 million or 2 percent in 2014 as compared to 2013, and increased 6 percent excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates.2 The increase was primarily driven by higher Loyalty Partner-related fees, higher discount revenue and an increase in net card fees. Billed business increased 2 percent in 2014 as compared to 2013, and 6 percent excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates. Refer to Table 7 for additional information on billed business by region.

Interest income decreased $33 million or 3 percent in 2014 as compared to 2013, and increased 2 percent excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates.2

Interest expense decreased $31 million or 9 percent in 2014 as compared to 2013, and decreased 2 percent excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates,2 primarily due to lower funding costs.

Total revenues net of interest expense increased $95 million or 2 percent in 2013 as compared to 2012, primarily driven by higher net card fees, Loyalty Partner-related fees and foreign exchange conversion fee revenue.

PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES

Provisions for losses decreased $18 million or 5 percent in 2014, as compared to 2013, and decreased 1 percent excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates,2 primarily driven by a lower provision for charge cards.

Provisions for losses increased $109 million or 39 percent in 2013 as compared to 2012, primarily driven by a higher provision for both charge cards and Card Member loans. The increase in charge card provision was driven by higher average receivables resulting in higher net write-offs and a reserve build in 2013. The increase in Card Member loans provision was driven by a lower reserve release compared to 2012, partially offset by lower net write-offs.

Refer to Table 13 for the lending and charge write-off rates for 2014, 2013 and 2012.

EXPENSES

Marketing, promotion, rewards and Card Member services and other expenses increased $147 million or 7 percent in 2014 as compared to 2013, and increased 11 percent excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates.3 The increase was primarily driven by higher marketing and promotion expenses, as a result of the reinvestment of a significant portion of the gains from the business travel joint venture transaction and the sale of our investment in Concur in growth initiatives, and higher Loyalty Partner expenses.

Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses increased $156 million or 7 percent in 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily driven by restructuring charges in 2014.

Total expenses increased $2 million in 2013 as compared to 2012, primarily driven by a charge related to a change in the Membership Rewards URR estimation process for certain international countries in 2013, substantially offset by the restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 2012.

INCOME TAXES

The effective tax rate in all periods reflects the recurring permanent tax benefit related to the segment’s ongoing funding activities outside the U.S., which is allocated to ICS under the Company’s internal tax allocation process. The effective tax rate for 2013 also reflects the allocated share of tax benefits related to the resolution of certain prior years’ items and the effective tax rate for 2012 reflects the allocated share of tax benefits related to the realization of certain foreign tax credits. In addition, the effective tax rate in each of the periods reflects the impact of recurring permanent tax benefits on varying levels of pretax income.

(a)	Return on average segment capital is calculated by dividing (i) one-year period segment income ($411 million, $631 million and $634 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively) by (ii) one-year average segment capital ($3.0 billion for both 2014 and 2013 and $2.9 billion for 2012). Return on average tangible segment capital, a non-GAAP measure, is computed in the same manner as return on average segment capital except the computation of average tangible segment capital, a non-GAAP measure, excludes from average segment capital average goodwill and other intangibles of $1.4 billion at December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. We believe return on average tangible segment capital is a useful measure of the profitability of our business.
(b)	Historically, due to system constraints, net loss ratio as a % of charge volume and 90 days past billing as a % of receivables were presented. Beginning in the first quarter of 2014, as a result of system enhancements, net write-off rate — principal only, net write-off rate — principal and fees and 30 days past due as a % of total are presented.
(c)	Refer to Table 8 footnote (e).
(d)	Adjusted net interest income, adjusted average loans and net interest yield on Card Member loans are non-GAAP measures. We believe adjusted net interest income and adjusted average loans are useful to investors because they are components of net interest yield on Card Member loans, which provides a measure of profitability of our Card Member loan portfolio.

GCS offers global corporate payment services to large and mid-sized companies. Our business travel operations, which had been included in GCS, were deconsolidated effective June 30, 2014 in connection with the business travel joint venture transaction, discussed previously; therefore, there is a lack of comparability against periods prior to the deconsolidation. Our proportional share of the GBT JV’s net income is now reported within other revenues.

TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE

Discount revenue, net card fees, and other revenues increased $88 million or 2 percent in 2014 as compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to the gain on the sale of our investment in Concur and higher discount revenue due to an increased level of Card Member spending, partially offset by the impact of the business travel joint venture transaction, resulting in a lack of comparability between periods. Billed business increased 6 percent in 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily driven by a 7 percent increase in average spending per proprietary basic card. Billed business volume increased 8 percent within the U.S. and increased 3 percent outside the U.S. in 2014.

Net interest expense decreased $7 million or 3 percent in 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily driven by a lower cost of funds.

Total revenues net of interest expense increased $104 million or 2 percent in 2013 as compared to 2012, primarily due to higher discount revenue from an increased level of Card Member spending.

PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES

Provisions for losses increased $51 million or 40 percent in 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily driven by a higher provision for charge cards. The increase in charge card provisions was primarily due to higher average Card Member receivables resulting in higher corporate card net write-offs. Provisions for losses increased $23 million or 22 percent in 2013 as compared to 2012, primarily driven by higher average Card Member receivables resulting in higher net write-offs, partially offset by a lower reserve build compared to 2012. Refer to Table 15 for the charge card net loss ratio as a percentage of charge volume.

EXPENSES

Marketing, promotion, rewards, Card Member services and other expenses increased $78 million or 13 percent in 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily driven by higher Card Member rewards and marketing and promotion expenses. The increase in rewards costs was primarily driven by higher spending volumes and includes the impact of a $13 million charge related to the Delta partnership renewal in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase in marketing and promotion expenses was driven by the reinvestment of a significant portion of the gains from the business travel joint venture transaction and the sale of our investment in Concur in growth initiatives.

2014 FINANCIAL REVIEW

 

Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses decreased $1.2 billion or 42 percent in 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily due to the impact of the global business travel joint venture transaction, resulting in a lack of comparability between periods, and the gain associated with the transaction in the second quarter of 2014, partially offset by transaction-related costs and restructuring charges.

Total expenses decreased $203 million or 6 percent in 2013 as compared to 2012, primarily driven by higher restructuring costs in 2012.

INCOME TAXES

The effective tax rate for 2013 reflects the reversal of a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets associated with certain of the Company’s non-U.S. business travel operations, as well as the allocated share of tax benefits related to the resolution of certain prior years’ tax items.

The effective tax rate for 2012 reflects the allocated share of tax benefits related to the realization of certain foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate for 2012 also reflects the impact of a valuation allowance primarily related to restructuring charges associated with certain non-U.S. travel operations.

(a)	Return on average segment capital is calculated by dividing (i) one-year period segment income ($1.5 billion, $860 million and $644 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively) by (ii) one-year average segment capital ($3.8 billion for 2014 and $3.6 billion for each 2013 and 2012). Return on average tangible segment capital, a non-GAAP measure, is computed in the same manner as return on average segment capital except the computation of average tangible segment capital, a non-GAAP measure, excludes from average segment capital average goodwill and other intangibles of $1.7 billion at December 31, 2014 and $1.8 billion at both December 31, 2013 and 2012. We believe return on average tangible segment capital is a useful measure of the profitability of our business.

GNMS operates a global payments network that processes and settles proprietary and non-proprietary card transactions. GNMS acquires merchants and provides point-of-sale products, multi-channel marketing programs and capabilities, services and data, leveraging the Company’s global closed-loop network. It enters into partnership agreements with third-party card issuers and acquirers, licensing the American Express brand and extending the reach of the global network.

TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE

Discount revenue, net card fees and other revenues increased $197 million or 4 percent in 2014 as compared to 2013. The increase was primarily driven by higher merchant-related revenues, driven by a 7 percent increase in global card billed business.

Net interest income increased $37 million or 13 percent in 2014 as compared to 2013, and increased 21 percent excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates.4 The increase was primarily driven by increased revenues on our merchant loans. The interest expense credit relates to internal transfer pricing and funding rates, which resulted in a net benefit for GNMS due to its merchant payables.

Total revenues net of interest expense increased $242 million or 5 percent in 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily due to higher discount revenue and net interest income.

PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES

Provisions for losses increased $26 million or 39 percent in 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily driven by a merchant-related charge in the fourth quarter. Provisions for losses decreased $6 million or 8 percent in 2013 as compared to 2012.

EXPENSES

Marketing, promotion, rewards, Card Member services and other expenses increased $115 million or 16 percent in 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily driven by the reinvestment of a significant portion of the gain from the business travel joint venture transaction in growth initiatives.

Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses decreased $58 million or 3 percent in 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily driven by the proposed merchant litigation settlement in the prior year.

Total expenses decreased $2 million in 2013 as compared to 2012, primarily driven by lower marketing and promotion, professional services and salary and employee benefit expenses, substantially offset by the proposed merchant litigation settlement in 2013.

Return on average tangible segment capital, a non-GAAP measure, is computed in the same manner as return on average segment capital except the computation of average tangible segment capital, a non-GAAP measure, excludes from average segment capital average goodwill and other intangibles of $189 million, $195 million and $203 million as of December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We believe return on average tangible segment capital is a useful measure of the profitability of our business.
CORPORATE & OTHER

Corporate functions and certain other businesses, including our Enterprise Growth Group and other operations, are included in Corporate & Other.

Corporate & Other net expense increased to $929 million in 2014, as compared to $900 million and $831 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively. The increase in net expense in 2014 was due to higher restructuring charges, a charitable contribution to the American Express Foundation combined with incremental investments in growth initiatives, partially offset by lower salary and benefits expense. The increase in net after-tax expense for 2013 was primarily due to favorable effects in 2012 of revised estimates of the liability for uncashed Travelers Cheques in certain international countries, as well as higher tax expenses in 2013, partially offset by the impact of restructuring costs in 2012.

Results for all periods disclosed also included net interest expense related to maintaining the liquidity pool discussed in “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity – Liquidity Management”, as well as interest expense related to other corporate indebtedness.

CONSOLIDATED CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

Our balance sheet management objectives are to maintain:

 

•	 	
A solid and flexible equity capital profile;

 

•	 	
A broad, deep and diverse set of funding sources to finance our assets and meet operating requirements; and

 

•	 	
Liquidity programs that enable us to continuously meet expected future financing obligations and business requirements for at least a 12-month period, even in the event we are unable to continue to raise new funds under our traditional funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions.

CAPITAL STRATEGY

Our objective is to retain sufficient levels of capital generated through earnings and other sources to maintain a solid equity capital base and to provide flexibility to support future business growth. We believe capital allocated to growing businesses with a return on risk-adjusted equity in excess of our costs will generate shareholder value.

The level and composition of our consolidated capital position are determined through our internal capital adequacy assessment process, which takes into account our business activities, as well as marketplace conditions and requirements or expectations of credit rating agencies, regulators and shareholders, among others. Our consolidated capital position is also influenced by subsidiary capital requirements. As a bank holding company, we are also subject to regulatory requirements administered by the U.S. federal banking agencies. The Federal Reserve has established specific capital adequacy guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items.

As a Basel III Advanced Approaches institution, we reported our capital ratios using Basel III capital definitions, inclusive of transition provisions, and Basel I risk-weighted assets. Beginning in 2015, we will report our capital ratios using the Basel III capital definitions, inclusive of transition provisions, and the Basel III Standardized Approach for calculating risk-weighted assets. The Basel III standards will be fully phased-in by January 1, 2019. We have also adopted Basel III in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions.

We also report capital adequacy standards on a parallel basis to regulators under Basel requirements for a Basel III Advanced Approaches institution. The parallel period will continue until we receive regulatory approval to exit parallel reporting and subsequently begin publicly reporting our capital ratios using both Basel III Standardized and Advanced Approaches.

The following table presents our regulatory risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios and those of our significant bank subsidiaries, as well as additional ratios widely utilized in the marketplace, as of December 31, 2014.

(a)	Transitional Basel III minimum and conservation buffer as defined by the Federal Reserve for calendar year 2014 for Advanced Approaches institutions.
(b)	Refer to page 41 for a discussion of tangible common equity, a non-GAAP measure.
The transition provisions for 2014 under Basel III cause our reported capital ratios to be higher than they would have been under the prior regulatory standards, known as Basel I. Specifically, the Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios would have been approximately 45 and 40 basis points lower, respectively, under Basel I. The largest contributor to the difference is the way intangible assets are being treated and ultimately transitioned in over a 5-year period under Basel III.

We seek to maintain capital levels and ratios in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements and finance such capital in a cost efficient manner; failure to maintain minimum capital levels could affect our status as a financial holding company and cause the respective regulatory agencies to take actions that could limit our business operations.

Our primary source of equity capital has been the generation of net income. Historically, capital generated through net income and other sources, such as the exercise of stock options by employees, has exceeded the annual growth in our capital requirements. To the extent capital has exceeded business, regulatory and rating agency requirements, we have historically returned excess capital to shareholders through our regular common share dividend and share repurchase program.

We maintain certain flexibility to shift capital across our businesses as appropriate. For example, we may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements. These infused amounts can affect the capital profile and liquidity levels at the American Express parent company level. We do not currently intend or foresee a need to shift capital from non-U.S. subsidiaries with permanently reinvested earnings to a U.S. parent company.

The following provides definitions for our regulatory risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratio, which are calculated as per standard regulatory guidance:

Risk-Weighted Assets — Assets are weighted for risk according to a formula used by the Federal Reserve to conform to capital adequacy guidelines. On- and off-balance sheet items are weighted for risk, with off-balance sheet items converted to balance sheet equivalents, using risk conversion factors, before being allocated a risk-adjusted weight. The off-balance sheet items comprise a minimal part of the overall calculation. Risk-weighted assets under Basel I as of December 31, 2014 were $133.3 billion.

2014 FINANCIAL REVIEW

Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio — The Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is calculated as Common Equity Tier 1 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. Common Equity Tier 1 is the sum of common shareholders’ equity, adjusted for ineligible goodwill and intangible assets, certain deferred tax assets, as well as certain other comprehensive income items as follows: net unrealized gains/losses on securities and derivatives, and net unrealized pension and other postretirement benefit losses, all net of tax and subject to transition provision. Common Equity Tier 1 capital as of December 31, 2014 was $17.5 billion.

Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio — The Tier 1 capital ratio is calculated as Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 capital is the sum of Common Equity Tier 1 capital, our perpetual preferred stock and third-party non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries. Tier 1 capital as of December 31, 2014 was $18.2 billion.

Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio — The total risk-based capital ratio is calculated as the sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 2 capital is the sum of the allowance for receivable and loan losses (limited to 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets) a portion of the unrealized gains on equity securities, $600 million of subordinated notes issued in the fourth quarter of 2014 and a $750 million subordinated hybrid security. The $750 million subordinated hybrid security does not meet the requirements of Tier 2 capital under Basel III, and is being transitioned out of capital (the total amount included in Tier 2 capital as of December 31, 2014 was $375 million). Hence, the total amount of subordinated debt included in Tier 2 capital as of December 31, 2014 was $975 million. Tier 2 capital as of December 31, 2014 was $2.6 billion. See “Fully Phased-in Basel III” section.

Tier 1 Leverage Ratio — The Tier 1 leverage ratio is calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by our average total consolidated assets for the most recent quarter. Average total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2014 were $154.7 billion.

The following provides a definition for Tangible Common Equity to Risk-Weighted Assets ratio, which is widely used in the marketplace, although it may be calculated differently by different companies:

Common Equity and Tangible Common Equity to Risk-Weighted Assets Ratios — Common equity equals our shareholders’ equity of $20.7 billion as of December 31, 2014, less preferred shares of $0.7 billion. Tangible common equity, a non-GAAP measure, equals common equity less goodwill and other intangibles of $3.9 billion as of December 31, 2014. We believe presenting the ratio of tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets is a useful measure of evaluating the strength of our capital position.

FULLY PHASED-IN BASEL III

Basel III, when fully phased-in, will require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain more capital than prior requirements, with a greater emphasis on common equity. We estimate that had Basel III been fully phased-in during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, our reported Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios would have been 12.2 percent and 12.8 percent, respectively, and our reported Tier 1 leverage ratio would have been 11.1 percent. As of December 31, 2014, had the Basel III rules been fully phased-in, our supplementary leverage ratio would be 9.4 percent.5 These ratios are calculated using the Standardized Approach for determining risk-weighted assets. As noted previously, we are currently taking steps toward Basel III Advanced Approaches implementation in the U.S.

The Basel capital standards establish minimum requirements for the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios that are 1.5 percent higher than the minimum requirements for Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios. This difference between Tier 1 capital, which includes common equity and qualifying preferred securities, and Common Equity Tier 1 is also present in the minimum capital requirements within Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), beginning with the 2014 plan submissions. We received no-objection to issue preferred stock in our 2014 CCAR submission. Accordingly, we issued $750 million of preferred shares in the fourth quarter of 2014. We also anticipate a further issuance of preferred shares in the first quarter of 2015, subject to market conditions. The preferred shares issuance helps to finance a portion of the Tier 1 capital requirements in excess of common equity requirements.

Our $750 million subordinated hybrid security, which was previously fully included in Tier 2 capital (but not in Tier 1 capital), does not meet the requirements of Tier 2 capital under Basel III. The phase-out of this subordinated hybrid security from Tier 2 capital began in the first quarter of 2014, which affects our total risk-based capital ratio. As previously mentioned, we issued $600 million of subordinated debt in the fourth quarter of 2014, which qualifies as Tier 2 capital under Basel rules. Our total risk-based capital ratio is expected to remain well in excess of the required minimum.

 

 

 

5  	The Fully Phased-in Basel III capital ratios are non-GAAP measures. We believe the presentation of the capital ratios is helpful to investors by showing the impact of future regulatory capital standards on our capital ratios.

The following provides definitions for Fully Phased-in Basel III capital ratios as defined by the Basel III rules using the Standardized Approach. All calculations are non-GAAP measures.

Fully Phased-in Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio – The Fully Phased-in Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is calculated as Common Equity Tier 1 under Fully Phased-in Basel III rules divided by risk-weighted assets under Fully Phased-in Basel III rules.

Fully Phased-in Basel III Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio – The Fully Phased-in Basel III Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is calculated as Tier 1 capital under Fully Phased-in Basel III rules divided by risk-weighted assets under Fully Phased-in Basel III rules.

The following table presents a comparison of our Common Equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 risk-based capital under Transitional Basel III rules to our estimated Common Equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 risk-based capital under Fully Phased-in Basel III rules as of December 31, 2014.

Fully Phased-in Basel III Risk-Weighted Assets – The Fully Phased-in Basel III risk-weighted assets reflect our Basel I risk-weighted assets, adjusted under Fully Phased-in Basel III rules. This includes incremental risk weighting applied to deferred tax assets and significant investments in unconsolidated financial institutions, as well as exposures to past due accounts, equities and sovereigns. The Fully Phased-in Basel III risk-weighted assets as of December 31, 2014 were estimated to be $134.3 billion.

Fully Phased-in Basel III Tier 1 Leverage Ratio – The Fully Phased-in Basel III Tier 1 leverage ratio is calculated by dividing Fully Phased-in Basel III Tier 1 capital by our average total consolidated assets.

Basel III Supplementary Leverage Ratio – The supplementary leverage ratio under Fully Phased-in Basel III rules is calculated by dividing Fully Phased-in Basel III Tier 1 capital by our total assets for supplementary leverage capital purposes under Basel III. Total assets for supplementary leverage capital purposes reflect total consolidated assets with adjustments for Tier 1 capital deductions, off-balance sheet derivatives, undrawn unconditionally cancellable commitments and other off-balance sheet liabilities. Total assets for supplementary leverage capital purposes as of December 31, 2014 were estimated to be $183.1 billion.

SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS

We have a share repurchase program to return excess capital to shareholders. The share repurchases reduce shares outstanding and offset, in whole or part, the issuance of new shares as part of employee compensation plans.

During the year ended December 31, 2014, we returned $5.4 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends ($1.0 billion) and share repurchases ($4.4 billion). We repurchased 49 million common shares at an average price of $89.60 in 2014. These dividend and share repurchase amounts represent approximately 86.1 percent of total capital generated during the year. This distribution percentage for 2014 is significantly greater than the on average and over time target to distribute approximately 50 percent of the capital to shareholders as dividends or through the repurchases of common stock. The 2014 percentage results from the strength of our capital ratios and the amount of capital we generate from net income and through employee stock plans in relation to the amount of capital required to support our organic business growth and acquisitions.

On January 5, 2015, we submitted our comprehensive capital plan to the Federal Reserve. The capital plan includes an analysis of performance and capital availability under certain adverse economic assumptions. The capital plan was submitted to the Federal Reserve pursuant to its guidance on dividends and capital distributions. We expect a response from the Federal Reserve by March 11, 2015. In the first quarter of 2015, we expect to execute share repurchases up to $1.0 billion pursuant to our capital plan that received no objections from the Federal Reserve in March 2014. The actual number of shares that will be repurchased will be based on market conditions and employee plan activities.

FUNDING STRATEGY

Our principal funding objective is to maintain broad and well-diversified funding sources to allow us to meet our maturing obligations, cost-effectively finance current and future asset growth in our global businesses as well as to maintain a strong liquidity profile. The diversity of funding sources by type of instrument, by maturity and by investor base, among other factors, provides additional insulation from the impact of disruptions in any one type of instrument, maturity or investor. The mix of our funding in any period will seek to achieve cost efficiency consistent with both maintaining diversified sources and achieving our liquidity objectives. Our funding strategy and activities are integrated into our asset-liability management activities. We have in place a funding policy covering American Express Company and all of our subsidiaries.

Our proprietary card businesses are the primary asset-generating businesses, with significant assets in both domestic and international Card Member receivable and lending activities. Our financing needs are in large part a consequence of our proprietary card-issuing businesses and the maintenance of a liquidity position to support all of our business activities, such as merchant payments. We generally pay merchants for card transactions prior to reimbursement by Card Members and therefore fund the merchant payments during the period Card Member loans and receivables are outstanding. We also have additional financing needs associated with general corporate purposes, including acquisition activities.

FUNDING PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES

The Company meets its funding needs through a variety of sources, including direct and third-party distributed deposits and debt instruments, such as senior unsecured debentures, asset securitizations, borrowings through secured borrowing facilities and long-term committed bank borrowing facilities in certain non-U.S. regions.

The Company had the following consolidated debt and customer deposits outstanding as of December 31:

 	$	105.7	  	 	$	102.1	  
Management does not currently expect to make any significant changes to our funding programs in order to satisfy Basel III’s liquidity coverage ratio standard based upon its current understanding of the requirements, which may be subject to change as we receive additional clarification and implementation guidance from regulators relating to the requirements and as the interpretation of the requirements evolve over time.

Our funding plan for the full year 2015 includes, among other sources, approximately $3 billion to $9 billion of unsecured term debt issuance and $3 billion to $9 billion of secured term debt issuance. Our funding plans are subject to various risks and uncertainties, such as future business growth, the impact of global economic, political and other events on market capacity, demand for securities offered by us, regulatory changes, ability to securitize and sell receivables, and the performance of receivables previously sold in securitization transactions. Many of these risks and uncertainties are beyond our control.

Our equity capital and funding strategies are designed, among other things, to maintain appropriate and stable unsecured debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies: Moody’s Investor Services (Moody’s), Standard & Poor’s (S&P), Fitch Ratings (Fitch) and Dominion Bond Rating Services (DBRS). Such ratings help support our access to cost-effective unsecured funding as part of our overall funding strategy. Our asset-backed securitization (ABS) activities are rated separately.

Downgrades in the ratings of our unsecured debt or asset securitization program securities could result in higher funding costs, as well as higher fees related to borrowings under our unused lines of credit. Declines in credit ratings could also reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets. We believe our funding mix, including the proportion of U.S. retail deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on our funding capacity and costs.

SHORT-TERM FUNDING PROGRAMS

Short-term borrowings, such as commercial paper, are defined as any debt with an original maturity of 12 months or less, as well as interest-bearing overdrafts with banks. Our short-term funding programs are used primarily to meet working capital needs, such as managing seasonal variations in receivables balances. The amount of short-term borrowings issued in the future will depend on our funding strategy, our needs and market conditions.

We had the following short-term borrowings outstanding as of December 31:

DEPOSIT PROGRAMS

We offer deposits within our American Express Centurion Bank (Centurion Bank) and American Express Bank, FSB (FSB) subsidiaries (together, the Banks). These funds are currently insured up to $250,000 per account holder through the FDIC. Our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates is dependent on the Banks’ capital levels. We, through the FSB, have a direct retail deposit program, Personal Savings from American Express, to supplement our distribution of deposit products sourced through third-party distribution channels. The direct retail program makes FDIC-insured certificates of deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings account products available directly to consumers.

LONG-TERM DEBT PROGRAMS

During 2014, we and our subsidiaries issued debt and asset securitizations with maturities ranging from 3 to 10 years. These amounts included approximately $5.3 billion of AAA-rated securitization certificates and notes, $0.1 billion of subordinated securities and $8.2 billion of unsecured debt across a variety of maturities and markets. During the year, we retained approximately $0.8 billion of subordinated securities, as the pricing and yields for these securities were not attractive compared to our other sources of financing available.

Our 2014 debt issuances were as follows:

ASSET SECURITIZATION PROGRAMS

We periodically securitize Card Member receivables and loans arising from our card business, as the securitization market provides us with cost-effective funding. Securitization of Card Member receivables and loans is accomplished through the transfer of those assets to a trust, which in turn issues securities collateralized by the transferred assets to third party investors. The proceeds from issuance are distributed to us, through our wholly owned subsidiaries, as consideration for the transferred assets.

The receivables and loans being securitized are reported as assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and the related securities issued to third-party investors are reported as long-term debt.

Under the respective terms of the securitization trust agreements, the occurrence of certain triggering events associated with the performance of the assets of each trust could result in payment of trust expenses, establishment of reserve funds, or in a worst-case scenario, early amortization of investor securities. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, no such triggering events occurred.

2014 FINANCIAL REVIEW

 

LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT

Our liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of on- and off-balance sheet liquidity sources. We maintain liquidity sources in amounts sufficient to meet business requirements and expected future financial obligations for a period of at least twelve months in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions. We have in place a liquidity risk policy that sets out our approach to managing liquidity risk on an enterprise-wide basis.

We incur and accept liquidity risk arising in the normal course of offering our products and services. The liquidity risks that we are exposed to can arise from a variety of sources, and thus our liquidity management strategy includes a variety of parameters, assessments and guidelines, including, but not limited to:

 

•	 	
Maintaining a diversified set of funding sources (refer to Funding Strategy section for more details);

 

•	 	
Maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and off-balance sheet liquidity sources available to meet obligations;

 

•	 	
Projecting cash inflows and outflows from a variety of sources and under a variety of scenarios; and

 

•	 	
Incorporating into the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process trade-offs between the risk of insufficient liquidity and our profitability.

We seek to maintain access to a diverse set of liquidity sources, including cash and other liquid assets on-balance sheet as well as off-balance sheet financing sources such as committed bank facilities and ABS conduit facilities, in order to comply with requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and other regulatory measures of liquidity such as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR). We, through our U.S. bank subsidiaries, also hold collateral eligible for use at the Federal Reserve’s discount window.

We seek to satisfy the requirements of a variety of stress scenarios, including those required by law and regulation as well as our own stress scenario, in order to determine the amount and mix of the liquidity sources we maintain at any given time. These stress scenarios possess distinct characteristics and vary by cash flow assumptions, time horizon and qualifying liquidity sources, among other factors. Our own stress scenario assumes we are unable to access our regular funding programs during a severe macroeconomic scenario, in which case we would target a mix of on- and off-balance sheet liquidity sources to satisfy financial obligations, such as debt maturities, and the projected net cash flows needs of our businesses for a period of at least twelve months. The LCR is another form of stress scenario that prescribes distinct cash flow assumptions over a 30-day period, and establishes criteria for qualifying on balance sheet assets as High-Quality Liquid Assets.

We consider various factors in determining the amount of liquidity we maintain, such as economic and financial market conditions, seasonality in business operations, growth in our businesses, potential acquisitions or dispositions, the cost and availability of alternative liquidity sources, and regulatory and credit rating agency considerations.

The yield we receive on our cash and readily marketable securities is, generally, less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances. Thus, we incur substantial net interest costs on these amounts. The level of net interest costs will be dependent on the size of our cash and readily marketable securities holdings, as well as the difference between our cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields.

Securitized Borrowing Capacity

As of December 31, 2014, we maintained our committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility, with a maturity date of July 15, 2016, that gives us the right to sell up to $3.0 billion face amount of eligible AAA notes from the American Express Issuance Trust II (the Charge Trust). We also maintained our committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility, with a maturity date of September 15, 2017, that gives us the right to sell up to $2.0 billion face amount of eligible AAA certificates from the Lending Trust. Both facilities are used in the ordinary course of business to fund seasonal working capital needs, as well as to further enhance our contingent funding resources. As of December 31, 2014, $2.5 billion was drawn on the Charge Trust facility, which was repaid on February 17, 2015, and no amounts were drawn on the Lending Trust facility.

Federal Reserve Discount Window

As insured depository institutions, the Banks may borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, subject to the amount of qualifying collateral that they may pledge. The Federal Reserve has indicated that both credit and charge card receivables are a form of qualifying collateral for secured borrowings made through the discount window. Whether specific assets will be considered qualifying collateral and the amount that may be borrowed against the collateral remain at the discretion of the Federal Reserve.

We had approximately $55.3 billion as of December 31, 2014 in U.S. credit card loans and charge card receivables that could be sold over time through our existing securitization trusts, or pledged in return for secured borrowings to provide further liquidity, subject in each case to applicable market conditions and eligibility criteria.

Committed Bank Credit Facilities

In addition to the secured borrowing facilities described earlier in this section, we maintained committed syndicated bank credit facilities as of December 31, 2014 of $6.7 billion through facilities in the U.S. and Australia, which expire as follows:

Total

 	$	6.7	  
The availability of the credit lines is subject to our compliance with certain financial covenants, principally the maintenance by American Express Credit Corporation (Credco) of a certain ratio of combined earnings and fixed charges to fixed charges. As of December 31, 2014, we were in compliance with each of our covenants. The drawn balance of the committed credit facilities of $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2014 was used to fund our business activities in the normal course. The remaining capacity of the facilities mainly served to further enhance our contingent funding resources.

Our committed bank credit facilities do not contain material adverse change clauses, which might otherwise preclude borrowing under the credit facilities, nor are they dependent on our credit rating.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

Cash flows from operating activities primarily include net income adjusted for (i) non-cash items included in net income and (ii) changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities, which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of various payments.

For the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by operating activities was $11.0 billion as a result of net income of $5.9 billion adjusted for non-cash items such as certain changes in provisions for losses, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and the pretax gain of $0.6 billion related to the GBT JV transaction. In addition, the pretax gain of $0.7 billion on the sale of our investment in Concur is removed from operating activities since the proceeds of $1.0 billion are included as a cash inflow within investing activities. An increase in accounts payable and other liabilities, which is a source of cash, was driven by higher discount business volumes and the restructuring charge taken in the fourth quarter of the current year.

For the year ended December 31, 2013, net cash provided by operating activities was $8.5 billion as a result of net income of $5.4 billion adjusted for non-cash items such as certain changes in provisions for losses, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation.

For the year ended December 31, 2012, net cash provided by operating activities was $7.1 billion as a result of net income of $4.5 billion adjusted for non-cash items such as certain changes in provisions for losses, depreciation and amortization, deferred taxes and other, stock-based compensation. This was partially offset by the cash outflow due to the premium paid on the debt exchange of $0.5 billion.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Our investing activities primarily include changes in Card Member loans and receivables and our available-for-sale investment portfolio.

For the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash used in investing activities was $(8.0) billion consisting of a net increase in Card Member receivables and loans as well as purchases of premises and equipment, net of sales. This was partially offset by the sales and maturities of investments, including the $1.0 billion of proceeds from the sale of our investment in Concur.

For the year ended December 31, 2013, net cash used in investing activities was $(7.2) billion consisting of a net increase in Card Member receivables and loans as well as purchases of premises and equipment, net of sales.

For the year ended December 31, 2012, net cash used in investing activities was $(6.5) billion consisting of a net increase in Card Member receivables and loans as well as purchases of premises and equipment, net of sales, partially offset by the sales and maturities of investments.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

Our financing activities primarily include issuing and repaying debt, changes in customer deposits, issuing and repurchasing our common shares, and paying dividends.

For the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by financing activities was $11 million, primarily driven by net increases in customer deposits and short- and long-term debt, partially offset by repurchases of American Express common shares.

For the year ended December 31, 2013, net cash used in financing activities was $(3.9) billion, primarily driven by repurchases of American Express common shares.

For the year ended December 31, 2012, net cash used in financing activities was $(3.3) billion, primarily driven by repurchases of American Express common shares and a net reduction in short- and long-term debt, partially offset by a net increase in customer deposits.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

We have identified both on- and off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations and other relationships that may have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity and capital resources.

(a)	The table above excludes approximately $0.9 billion of tax liabilities related to the uncertainty in income taxes as inherent complexities and the number of tax years currently open for examination in multiple jurisdictions do not permit reasonable estimates of payments, if any, to be made over a range of years.
(b)	Estimated interest payments were calculated using the effective interest rate in place as of December 31, 2014, and includes the effect of existing interest rate swaps. Actual cash flows may differ from estimated payments.
(c)	As of December 31, 2014, there were no minimum required contributions, and no contributions are currently planned, for the U.S. American Express Retirement Plan. For the U.S. American Express Retirement Restoration Plan and non-U.S. defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans, contributions in 2015 are anticipated to be approximately $60 million, and this amount has been included within other long-term liabilities. Remaining obligations under defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans aggregating $707 million have not been included in the table above as the timing of such obligations is not determinable. Additionally, other long-term liabilities do not include $6.5 billion of Membership Rewards liabilities, which are not considered long-term liabilities as Card Members in good standing can redeem points immediately, without restrictions, and because the timing of point redemption is not determinable.
(d)	The purchase obligation amounts represent either the early termination fees or non-cancelable minimum contractual obligations, as applicable, by period under contracts that were in effect as of December 31, 2014.
We also have obligations to make payments under contractual agreements with certain co-brand partners. We expect to fully satisfy these obligations over the remaining term of these agreements, which range from 2015 to 2022, as part of the ongoing operations of our business. The obligations under such arrangements were approximately $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2014.

In addition to the contractual obligations noted above, we have off-balance sheet arrangements that include guarantees and other off-balance sheet arrangements.

GUARANTEES

Our principal guarantees are associated with Card Member services to enhance the value of owning an American Express card. As of December 31, 2014, we had guarantees totaling approximately $45 billion related to Card Member protection plans, as well as other guarantees in the ordinary course of business. Refer to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding our guarantees.

CERTAIN OTHER OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

As of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $278 billion of unused credit available to Card Members. Total unused credit available to Card Members does not represent potential future cash requirements, as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn. Our charge card products generally have no pre-set limit, and therefore are not included in unused credit available to Card Members.

To mitigate counterparty credit risk related to derivatives, the Company accepted non-cash collateral in the form of security interests in U.S. Treasury securities from its derivatives counterparties with a fair value of $91 million and nil as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, none of which was sold or repledged.

Refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion regarding our other off-balance sheet arrangements.

RISK MANAGEMENT

GOVERNANCE

We use our comprehensive Enterprise-wide Risk Management (ERM) program to identify, aggregate, monitor, and manage risks. The program also defines our risk appetite, governance, culture and capabilities. The implementation and execution of the ERM program is headed by our Chief Risk Officer.

Risk management is overseen by our Board of Directors through three committees: the Risk Committee, the Audit and Compliance Committee, and the Compensation and Benefits Committee. Each committee consists entirely of independent directors and provides regular reports to the Board of Directors regarding matters reviewed at the committee level. In addition to the risks under the purview of a particular committee, the Board of Directors monitors the “tone at the top” and our risk culture, oversees strategic risk, and reviews specific and aggregate risks we face from time to time. These Board committees meet regularly in private sessions with our Chief Risk Officer, the Chief Compliance & Ethics Officer, the General Auditor and other senior management with regard to our risk management processes, controls and capabilities.

The Risk Committee of our Board of Directors provides risk oversight on risk policies and our risk management performance. The Risk Committee approves key risk management policies and monitors risk culture, talent, capabilities and outcomes. In particular, the Risk Committee approves our ERM policy along with its sub-policies governing individual credit risk, institutional credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, reputational risk and asset/liability risk, as well as policies governing the launch of new products and services, third-party management and resolution planning. The ERM policy defines the risk appetite as well as governance over risk taking and our risk oversight processes. Risk appetite defines the levels and types of risks we are willing to assume to achieve our business plans while controlling risk exposures well within our risk capacity. In addition, it establishes principles for risk taking in the aggregate and for each risk type, and is supported by a comprehensive system of risk limits, escalation triggers and control programs.

The Risk Committee reviews and concurs in the appointment, replacement, performance and compensation of the Company’s Chief Risk Officer. The Risk Committee receives regular updates from the global risk oversight teams that report to the Chief Risk Officer on key risks, transactions and exposures.

The Risk Committee reviews our credit risk profile as well as credit risk performance, trends and risk management capabilities.

The Risk Committee also reviews enterprise-wide operational risk trends, events and capabilities, with an emphasis on compliance, fraud, legal, process or control failures, information security, and privacy, as well as trends in market, funding, liquidity and reputational risks. The Risk Committee also provides oversight of our compliance with Basel capital and liquidity standards and its Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process, including its CCAR submissions; and resolution planning.

The Audit and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors approves our compliance policies and risk tolerance, and reinforces the importance of our compliance risk management. In addition, the Audit and Compliance Committee reviews the effectiveness of our Corporate-wide Compliance Risk Management Program. More broadly, this committee is responsible for assisting the Board in its oversight responsibilities relating to the integrity of our financial statements and financial reporting process; internal and external auditing, including the qualifications and independence of the independent registered public accounting firm and the performance of our internal audit services function; and the integrity of our systems of internal accounting and financial controls.

The Audit and Compliance Committee provides oversight of the Company’s Internal Audit Group. The Audit and Compliance Committee reviews and concurs in the appointment, replacement, performance and compensation of the Company’s General Auditor and approves Internal Audit’s annual Audit Plan, charter, policies and budget. The Audit and Compliance Committee also receives regular updates on the Audit Plan’s status and results including significant reports issued by Internal Audit and the status of management’s corrective actions.

The Compensation and Benefits Committee of our Board of Directors works with the Chief Risk Officer to ensure the compensation programs covering the Company overall, our business units and risk-taking employees appropriately balance risk with incentives such that business performance is achieved without taking imprudent or uneconomic risks. Our Chief Risk Officer is actively involved in setting goals for the Company and our business units. Our Chief Risk Officer also reviews the current and forward-looking risk profiles of each business unit, and provides input into performance evaluation. The Chief Risk Officer meets with the Compensation and Benefits Committee and attests whether performance goals and results have been achieved without taking imprudent risks. The Compensation and Benefits Committee uses a risk-balanced incentive compensation framework to decide on our bonus pools and the compensation of senior executives.

There are several internal management committees, including the Enterprise-wide Risk Management Committee (ERMC), chaired by our Chief Risk Officer, which oversee risks. The ERMC is responsible for risk governance and oversight. It maintains the enterprise-wide risk appetite framework and monitors compliance with limits and escalations defined in it. The ERMC oversees implementation of risk policies across the Company with approval by the appropriate board committee. The ERMC reviews key risk exposures, trends and concentrations, significant compliance matters, economic capital and Basel capital trends, and provides guidance on the steps to monitor, control and report major risks.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY

2014 FINANCIAL REVIEW

 

As defined in the ERM policy, we follow the “three lines of defense” approach to risk management. The first line of defense comprises functions and management committees directly initiating risk taking. Business unit presidents, our Chief Credit Officer, Chief Operational Risk Officer, Chief Market Risk Officer and Functional Risk Officer are part of the first line of defense.

The second line comprises independent functions overseeing risk taking activities of the first line. The Global Risk Oversight Officer and Market Risk Oversight Officer, the Chief Compliance & Ethics Officer, the Corporate Comptroller and certain control groups, both at the enterprise level and within regulated entities, are part of the second line of defense. The global risk oversight teams oversee the policies, strategies, frameworks, processes and capabilities deployed by the first line teams and act as a check to the first line of defense in managing risks.

Our Internal Audit Group constitutes the third line of defense, and provides independent assessments and effective challenge of the first and second lines of defense.

In addition, the Asset-Liability Committee (ALCO), chaired by the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for managing market, liquidity, asset/liability risk and capital.

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS

Credit risk is defined as loss due to obligor or counterparty default or changes in the credit quality of a security. Our credit risks are divided into two broad categories: individual and institutional. Each has distinct risk management capabilities, strategies, and tools. Business units that create individual or institutional credit risk exposures of significant importance are supported by dedicated risk management teams, each led by a Chief Credit Officer. To preserve independence, Chief Credit Officers for all business units report to our Chief Credit Officer, who in turn reports directly to our Chief Risk Officer.

INDIVIDUAL CREDIT RISK

Individual credit risk arises principally from consumer and small business charge cards, credit cards, lines of credit, and loans. These portfolios consist of millions of customers across multiple geographies, industries and levels of net worth. We benefit from the high-quality profile of our customers, which is driven by our brand, premium customer servicing, product features and risk management capabilities, which span underwriting, customer management and collections. Externally, the risk in these portfolios is correlated to broad economic trends, such as unemployment rates and GDP growth, which can affect customer liquidity.

The business unit leaders and their Chief Credit Officers take the lead in managing the individual credit risk process. These Chief Credit Officers are guided by the Individual Credit Risk Committee, which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the Individual Credit Risk Management Policy. This policy is further supported by subordinate policies and operating manuals covering decision logic and processes of credit extension, including prospecting, new account approvals, point-of-sale authorizations, credit line management and collections. The subordinate risk policies and operating manuals are designed to ensure consistent application of risk management principles and standardized reporting of asset quality and loss recognition.

Individual credit risk management is supported by sophisticated proprietary scoring and decision-making models that use the most up-to-date information on prospects and customers, such as spending and payment history and data feeds from credit bureaus. Additional data, such as commercial variables, are integrated to further mitigate small business risk. We have developed data-driven economic decision logic for customer interactions to better serve our customers.

INSTITUTIONAL CREDIT RISK

Institutional credit risk arises principally within our Global Corporate Payments, Global Merchant Services, GNS, Prepaid Services, and Foreign Exchange Services businesses, as well as investment and liquidity management activities. Unlike individual credit risk, institutional credit risk is characterized by a lower loss frequency but higher severity. It is affected both by general economic conditions and by client-specific events. The absence of large losses in any given year or over several years is not necessarily representative of the level of risk of institutional portfolios, given the infrequency of loss events in such portfolios.

2014 FINANCIAL REVIEW

 

Similar to Individual Credit Risk, business units taking institutional credit risks are supported by Chief Credit Officers. These officers are guided by the Institutional Risk Management Committee (IRMC), which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the Institutional Credit Risk Management Policy and for providing guidance to the credit officers of each business unit with substantial institutional credit risk exposures. The committee, along with the business unit Chief Credit Officers, makes investment decisions in core risk capabilities, ensures proper implementation of the underwriting standards and contractual rights of risk mitigation, monitors risk exposures, and determines risk mitigation actions. The IRMC formally reviews large institutional risk exposures to ensure compliance with ERMC guidelines and procedures and escalates them to the ERMC as appropriate. At the same time, the IRMC provides guidance to the business unit risk management teams to optimize risk-adjusted returns on capital. A centralized risk rating unit and a specialized airline risk group provide risk assessment of our institutional obligors.

Exposure to the Airline Industry

We have multiple important co-brand, rewards and corporate payments arrangements with airlines. The ERM program evaluates the risks posed by our airline partners and the overall airline strategy to all functions within the Company through comprehensive business analysis of global airlines. Our largest airline partner is Delta, and this relationship includes exclusive co-brand credit card partnerships and other arrangements including Membership Rewards redemption, merchant acceptance, travel and corporate payments. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014.

Sovereign Debt Exposure

As part of our ongoing risk management process, we monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and non-sovereign customers and counterparties, and measure and manage concentrations of risk by geographic regions, as well as by economic sectors and industries. A primary focus area for monitoring is credit deterioration due to weaknesses in economic and fiscal profiles. We evaluate countries based on the market assessment of the riskiness of their sovereign debt and our assessment of our economic and financial outlook and closely monitor those deemed high risk. As of December 31, 2014, we considered our gross credit exposures to government entities, financial institutions and corporations in those countries deemed high risk to be individually and collectively not material.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS

We define operational risk as the risk of not achieving business objectives due to inadequate or failed processes, people, or information systems, or the external environment, including failures to comply with laws and regulations. Operational risk is inherent in all business activities and can impact an organization through direct or indirect financial loss, brand damage, customer dissatisfaction, or legal and regulatory penalties.

To appropriately measure and manage operational risk, we have implemented a comprehensive operational risk framework that is defined in the Operational Risk Management Policy approved by the Risk Committee. The Operational Risk Management Committee (ORMC) coordinates with all control groups on effective risk assessments and controls and oversees the preventive, responsive and mitigation efforts by Lead Operational Risk Officers in the business units and staff groups. To preserve independence, the Lead Operational Risk Officers for all business units report to our Chief Operational Risk Officer, who in turn reports directly to our Chief Risk Officer.

We use the operational risk framework to identify, measure, monitor and report inherent and emerging operational risks. This framework, supervised by the ORMC, consists of (a) operational risk event capture, (b) a project office to coordinate issue management and control enhancements, (c) key risk indicators such as customer complaints or pre-implementation test metrics, and (d) process and entity-level risk assessments.

The framework requires the assessment of operational risk events to determine root causes, impact to customers and/or us, and resolution plan accountability to correct any defect, remediate customers, and enhance controls and testing to mitigate future issues. Our impact is assessed from an operational, financial, brand, regulatory compliance and legal perspective.

INFORMATION SECURITY, PRIVACY, AND DATA GOVERNANCE

We have implemented an Information Security Framework and Operating Model that is designed to protect information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification or destruction.

Chaired by the Chief Information Security Officer, our Information Security Risk Management Committee, a sub-committee of the ORMC, provides oversight and governance for our information security risk management activities. In addition, the committee is responsible for establishing cyber risk tolerances and in managing cyber crisis preparedness.

We assesses our cyber risk across four categories of “threat actors” that we currently believe pose the greatest risk, namely cyber criminals, nation state sponsored groups, determined insiders and “hacktivists” or social objectors. Our Information Security Framework and Operating Model uses an approach that looks at different phases of security to prepare, prevent, detect, respond and recover from cyber-security attacks.

Our Privacy Framework and Operating Model follows a similar structure. It is led by the Chief Privacy Officer and is integrated with the Chief Information Security Officer and Compliance Risk Management leaders. Our Privacy Risk Management Committee, another sub-committee of the ORMC, provides oversight and governance over the collection, notice, use, sharing, transfer, confidentiality and retention of personal data.

Our Enterprise Data Governance Framework and Policy defines governance and data standards for data used in regulatory reporting, risk management as well as other critical systems including big data capabilities.

COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS

We define compliance risk as the risk of legal or reputational harm, fines, monetary penalties and payment of damages or other forms of sanction as a result of non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations, rules or standards of conduct.

We view our ability to effectively mitigate compliance risk as an important aspect of our business model. Our Global Compliance and Ethics organization is responsible for establishing and maintaining our corporate-wide Compliance Risk Management Program. Pursuant to this program, we seek to manage and mitigate compliance risk by assessing, controlling, monitoring, measuring and reporting the regulatory risks to which we are exposed.

REPUTATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS

We define reputational risk as the risk that negative publicity regarding our products, services, business practices, management, clients and partners, whether perceived or real, could cause a decline in the customer base, costly litigation, or revenue reductions.

We view protecting our reputation as core to our vision of becoming the world’s most respected service brand and fundamental to our long-term success.

Our business leaders are responsible for ensuring that reputational risk implications of transactions, business activities and management practices are appropriately considered and relevant subject matter experts are engaged as needed. The ERMC and its sub-committees are responsible for reviewing decisions where reputational risk may exist and ensuring that reputational risk considerations are properly reflected.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS

Market risk is the risk to earnings or value resulting from movements in market prices. Our market risk exposure is primarily generated by:

 

•	 	
Interest rate risk in our card and insurance businesses, as well as in our investment portfolios; and

 

•	 	
Foreign exchange risk in our operations outside the U.S.

Market risk limits and escalation triggers within the Market Risk and Asset Liability Management (ALM) Policies are approved by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors and the ERMC. Market risk is centrally monitored for compliance with policy and limits by our Market Risk Committee, which reports into the ALCO and is chaired by the Chief Market Risk Officer. Market risk management is also guided by policies covering the use of derivative financial instruments, funding and liquidity and investments. The Market Risk Oversight Officer provides an independent risk assessment and oversight over the policies for market risk, liquidity risk and ALM activities.

Our market exposures are in large part by-products of the delivery of our products and services. Interest rate risk arises through the funding of Card Member receivables and fixed-rate loans with variable-rate borrowings as well as through the risk to net interest margin from changes in the relationship between benchmark rates such as Prime and LIBOR.

Interest rate exposure within our charge card and fixed-rate lending products is managed by varying the proportion of total funding provided by variable-rate debt and deposits compared to fixed-rate debt and deposits. In addition, interest rate swaps are used from time to time to effectively convert fixed-rate debt to variable-rate or to convert variable-rate debt to fixed-rate. We may change the mix between variable-rate and fixed-rate funding based on changes in business volumes and mix, among other factors.

2014 FINANCIAL REVIEW

 

We do not engage in derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Refer to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our derivative financial instruments.

We analyze a variety of scenarios to inform management of potential impacts to earnings and economic value of equity, which may occur given changes in interest rate curves using a range of severities. As of December 31, 2014, the detrimental effect on our annual net interest income of a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would be approximately $212 million. To calculate this effect, we first measure the potential change in net interest income over the following 12 months taking into consideration anticipated future business growth and market-based forward interest rates. We then stress the implied forward interest rate curve with a 100 basis point increase to measure the impact on the projected net interest income. This effect is primarily driven by the volume of charge card receivables that are non-interest earning and credit card loans deemed to be fixed-rate, which are funded by variable-rate liabilities. As of December 31, 2014, the percentage of worldwide charge card accounts receivable and credit card loans that were deemed to be fixed rate was 66.7 percent, or $78 billion, with the remaining 33.3 percent, or $39 billion, deemed to be variable-rate credit card loans.

We are also subject to market risk from changes in the relationship between the benchmark Prime rate that determines the yield on our variable-rate lending receivables and the benchmark LIBOR rate that determines the effective interest cost on a significant portion of our outstanding debt. Differences in the rate of change of these two indices, commonly referred to as basis risk, would impact our variable-rate U.S. lending net interest margins because we borrow at rates based on LIBOR but lend to our customers based on the Prime rate. The detrimental effect on our net interest income of a hypothetical 10 basis point decrease in the spread between Prime and one-month LIBOR over the next 12 months is estimated to be $38 million. We currently have approximately $38 billion of Prime-based, variable-rate U.S. lending receivables and $38 billion of LIBOR-indexed debt, including asset securitizations.

Foreign exchange risk is generated from three principal sources: 1) Card Member cross-currency charges, 2) foreign subsidiary equity and 3) foreign currency earnings in units outside the U.S. Our foreign exchange risk is managed primarily by entering into agreements to buy and sell currencies on a spot basis or by hedging a significant proportion of our foreign currency earnings. The exposures that are hedged are based on an economic justification and are executed through various means, including the use of derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward and cross-currency swap contracts.

As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, foreign currency derivative instruments with total notional amounts of approximately $30 billion and $27 billion were outstanding, respectively. Derivative hedging activities related to cross-currency charges, balance sheet exposures and foreign currency earnings generally do not qualify for hedge accounting; however, derivative hedging activities related to translation exposure of foreign subsidiary equity generally do.

We conduct scenario analysis to inform management of potential impacts to earnings that may occur due to changes in foreign exchange rates of various severities. With respect to cross-currency charges and balance sheet exposures, including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding, the effect on our earnings of a hypothetical 10 percent change in the value of the U.S. dollar would be immaterial as of December 31, 2014. With respect to earnings denominated in foreign currencies, the adverse impact on pretax income of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar related to anticipated overseas operating results for the next 12 months would be approximately $182 million as of December 31, 2014. With respect to translation exposure of foreign subsidiary equity, including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding, a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening in the U.S. dollar would result in an immaterial reduction in equity as of December 31, 2014.

The actual impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate changes will depend on, among other factors, the timing of rate changes, the extent to which different rates do not move in the same direction or in the same direction to the same degree, changes in the cost, volume and mix of our hedging activities and changes in the volume and mix of our businesses.

FUNDING & LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS

Liquidity risk is defined as our inability to meet our ongoing financial and business obligations as they become due at a reasonable cost. General principles and our overall framework for managing liquidity risk are defined in the Liquidity Risk Policy approved by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors and the ALCO. Liquidity risk limits are approved by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors and the ERMC. Liquidity risk is centrally managed by the Funding and Liquidity Committee, which reports into the ALCO. In addition, the Market Risk Oversight Officer provides independent oversight of liquidity risk. We manage liquidity risk by maintaining access to a diverse set of cash, readily-marketable securities and contingent sources of liquidity, such that we can continuously meet our business requirements and expected future financing obligations for at least a 12-month period, even in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions. We balance the trade-offs between maintaining too much liquidity, which can be costly and limit financial flexibility, and having inadequate liquidity, which may result in financial distress during a liquidity event.

Liquidity risk is managed both at an aggregate corporate level and at the major legal entities in order to ensure that sufficient funding and liquidity resources are available in the amount and in the location needed in a stress event. The Funding and Liquidity Committee reviews the forecasts of our aggregate and subsidiary cash positions and financing requirements, approves the funding plans designed to satisfy those requirements under normal conditions, establishes guidelines to identify the amount of liquidity resources required and monitors positions and determines any actions to be taken.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies referenced, as applicable, to other financial statement footnotes. Certain of our accounting policies that require significant management assumptions and judgments are set forth below.

RESERVES FOR CARD MEMBER LOSSES

Reserves for Card Member losses represent management’s best estimate of the probable losses inherent in our outstanding portfolio of Card Member loans and receivables, as of the balance sheet date.

In estimating these losses, management uses statistical and analytical models that analyze portfolio performance and reflect management’s judgment regarding the quantitative components of the reserve. The models take into account several factors, including delinquency-based loss migration rates, loss emergence periods and average losses over an appropriate historical period, as well as expected future recoveries. Management considers whether to adjust the quantitative reserve for certain external and internal qualitative factors that may increase or decrease the reserves for losses on Card Member loans and receivables.

The process of estimating these reserves requires a high degree of judgment. To the extent historical credit experience updated for external environmental trends is not indicative of future performance, actual losses could differ significantly from management’s judgments and expectations, resulting in either higher or lower future provisions for Card Member losses in any quarter.

As of December 31, 2014, a 10 percent increase in management’s estimate of losses inherent in the outstanding portfolio of Card Member loans and receivables evaluated collectively for impairment at such date would increase reserves for losses with a corresponding change to provision for losses by approximately $167 million. This sensitivity analysis is provided as a hypothetical scenario to assess the sensitivity of the provision for losses. It does not represent management’s expectations for losses in the future, nor does it include how other portfolio factors such as delinquency-based loss migration rates or recoveries, or the amount of outstanding balances, may impact the level of reserves for losses and the corresponding impact on the provision for losses.

LIABILITY FOR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS EXPENSE

The Membership Rewards program is our largest card-based rewards program. Card Members can earn points for purchases charged on their enrolled card products. Certain types of purchases allow Card Members to also earn bonus points. Membership Rewards points are redeemable for a broad variety of rewards including travel, entertainment, retail certificates and merchandise. Points typically do not expire, and there is no limit on the number of points a Card Member may earn.

We record a Membership Rewards liability that represents the estimated cost of points earned that are expected to be redeemed by Card Members in the future. The Membership Rewards liability is impacted over time by enrollment levels, attrition, the volume of points earned and redeemed, and the associated redemption costs. We estimate the Membership Rewards liability by determining the URR and the WAC per point, which are applied to the points of current enrollees.

The URR assumption is used to estimate the number of points earned by current enrollees that will ultimately be redeemed in future periods. Management uses statistical and actuarial models to estimate the URR of points earned to date by current Card Members based on redemption trends, card product type, enrollment tenure, card spend levels and credit attributes.

The WAC per point assumption is used to estimate future redemption costs and is primarily based on redemption choices made by Card Members, reward offerings by partners, and Membership Rewards program changes. The WAC per point is derived from the previous 12 months of redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for certain changes in redemption costs that are not representative of future cost expectations.

The process of estimating the Membership Rewards liability includes a high degree of judgment. Actual redemptions and associated redemption costs could differ significantly from management’s judgment, resulting in either higher or lower Membership Rewards expense. Management periodically evaluates its liability estimation process and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns, cost per point redeemed, partner contract changes and other factors.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY

2014 FINANCIAL REVIEW

 

Changes in the Membership Rewards URR and WAC per point have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the liability through the current period marketing, promotion, rewards and Card Member services expense by an amount estimated to cover the cost of all points previously earned but not yet redeemed by current enrollees as of the end of the reporting period. As of December 31, 2014, an increase in the estimated URR of current enrollees of 100 basis points would increase the Membership Rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately $319 million. Similarly, an increase in the WAC per point of 1 basis point would increase the Membership Rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately $82 million.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

We hold investment securities and derivative instruments that are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management makes assumptions and judgments when estimating the fair values of these financial instruments.

In accordance with fair value measurement and disclosure guidance, the objective of a fair value measurement is to determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date based on the principal or, in the absence of a principal, most advantageous market for the specific asset or liability. The disclosure guidance establishes a three-level hierarchy of inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to the measurement of fair value based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1), followed by the measurement of fair value based on pricing models with significant observable inputs (Level 2), with the lowest priority given to the measurement of fair value based on pricing models with significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). We did not have any Level 3 assets measured on a recurring basis during the year ended December 31, 2014. Refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Investment Securities

Our investment securities are mostly composed of fixed-income securities issued by states and municipalities as well as the U.S. Government and Agencies.

The fair market values for our investment securities, including investments comprising defined benefit pension plan assets, are obtained primarily from pricing services we engage. For each security, we receive one price from a pricing service we engage. The fair values provided by the pricing services are estimated using pricing models, where the inputs to those models are based on observable market inputs or recent trades of similar securities. The pricing services did not apply any adjustments to the pricing models used as of December 31, 2013 and 2014. In addition, we did not apply any adjustments to prices received from the pricing services. We reaffirm our understanding of the valuation techniques used by our pricing services at least annually. In addition, we corroborate the prices provided by our pricing services for reasonableness by comparing the prices from the respective pricing services to valuations obtained from different pricing sources as well as comparing prices to the sale prices received from sold securities at least quarterly.

In the measurement of fair value for our investment securities, even though the underlying inputs used in the pricing models are directly observable from active markets or recent trades of similar securities in inactive markets, the pricing models do entail a certain amount of subjectivity and therefore differing judgments in how the underlying inputs are modeled could result in different estimates of fair value.

Other-Than-Temporary Impairment of Investment Securities

Realized losses are recognized when management determines that a decline in the fair value of investment securities is other-than-temporary. Such determination requires judgment regarding the amount and timing of recovery. We review and evaluate our investment securities at least quarterly, and more often as market conditions may require, to identify investment securities that have indications of other-than-temporary impairments. We consider several factors when evaluating debt securities for other-than-temporary impairment, including the determination of the extent to which a decline in the fair value of a security is due to increased default risk for the specific issuer or market interest rate risk. With respect to market interest rate risk, we assess whether we have the intent to sell the investment securities and whether we are more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investment securities before recovery of any unrealized losses.

In determining whether any of our investment securities are other-than-temporarily impaired, a change in facts and circumstances could lead to a change in management judgment about our view on collectability and credit quality of the issuer, or the impact of market interest rates on the investment securities. Any such changes could result in us recognizing an other-than-temporary impairment loss through earnings.

Derivative Instruments

Our primary derivative instruments are interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward agreements.

The fair value of our derivative instruments is estimated by using either a third-party valuation service that uses proprietary pricing models, or by internal pricing models, where the inputs to those models are readily observable from actively quoted markets. We reaffirm our understanding of the valuation techniques used by a third-party valuation service at least annually.

To mitigate credit risk arising from our derivative instruments, counterparties are required to be pre-approved and rated as investment grade. In addition, we manage certain counterparty credit risks by exchanging cash and non-cash collateral under executed credit support agreements. The non-cash collateral does not reduce the derivative balance included in the Other assets line but effectively reduces risk exposure as it is available in the event of counterparty default. Based on the assessment of credit risk of our derivative counterparties, we do not have derivative positions that warrant credit valuation adjustments.

In the measurement of fair value for our derivative instruments, although the underlying inputs used in the pricing models are readily observable from actively quoted markets, the pricing models do entail a certain amount of subjectivity and, therefore, differing judgments in how the underlying inputs are modeled could result in different estimates of fair value.

GOODWILL RECOVERABILITY

Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost of an acquired business over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or when events or circumstances arise, such as adverse changes in the business climate, that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. Our approach and methodology for conducting our goodwill impairment testing is described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, but is fundamentally based on the measurement of fair value for our reporting units, which inherently entails the use of significant judgment.

For valuation, we use a combination of the income approach (discounted cash flows) and market approach (market multiples) in estimating the fair value of our reporting units.

When preparing discounted cash flow models under the income approach, we estimate future cash flows using the reporting unit’s internal multi-year forecast, and a terminal value calculated using a growth rate that management believes is appropriate in light of current and expected future economic conditions. To discount these cash flows we use our expected cost of equity, determined using a capital asset pricing model. When using the market method under the market approach, we apply comparable publically traded companies’ multiples (e.g., earnings, revenues) to our reporting units’ actual results. The judgment in estimating forecasted cash flows, discount rates and market comparables is significant, and imprecision could materially affect the fair value of our reporting units.

Based upon the updated valuations for our reporting units, we have concluded goodwill is not impaired as of December 31, 2014, nor was any goodwill written off during 2014. However, we could be exposed to increased risk of goodwill impairment if future operating results or macroeconomic conditions differ significantly from management’s current assumptions.

INCOME TAXES

We are subject to the income tax laws of the U.S., its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. These tax laws are complex, and the manner in which they apply to the taxpayer’s facts is sometimes open to interpretation. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make judgments about the application of inherently complex tax laws.

Unrecognized Tax Benefits

We establish a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which are the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit recognized in the financial statements.

In establishing a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit, assumptions may be made in determining whether, and the extent to which, a tax position should be sustained. A tax position is recognized only when it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority based on its technical merits. The amount of tax benefit recognized is the largest benefit that management believes is more likely than not to be realized on ultimate settlement. As new information becomes available, we evaluate our tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits, as appropriate.

Tax benefits ultimately realized can differ from amounts previously recognized due to uncertainties, with any such differences generally impacting the provision for income tax.

Deferred Tax Asset Realization

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.

Since deferred taxes measure the future tax effects of items recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements, certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making this assessment, management analyzes and estimates the impact of future taxable income, reversing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies. These assessments are performed quarterly, taking into account any new information.

Changes in facts or circumstances can lead to changes in the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets due to uncertainties.

OTHER MATTERS

CERTAIN LEGISLATIVE, REGULATORY AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS

As a participant in the financial services industry, and as a bank holding company, we are subject to comprehensive examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve and to a range of laws and regulations that impact our business and operations. In light of legislative initiatives over the last several years and continuing regulatory reform implementation, compliance requirements and expenditures have risen for financial services firms, including us, and we expect compliance requirements and expenditures will continue to rise in the future.

In addition, legislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the operation of card networks, including through antitrust actions, legislation and rules that would or do impose changes on certain practices or pricing of card issuers, merchant acquirers and payment networks and the establishment of broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes for payment systems. Regulators and legislators have focused on the fees merchants pay to accept cards, including the way bankcard network members collectively set the “interchange” (that is, the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in payment networks like Visa and MasterCard) and the fees merchants are charged for card acceptance, as well as the rules, contracts and monitoring and other controls governing merchant card acceptance. Although, unlike the Visa and MasterCard networks, the American Express payment network does not have interchange fees or collectively set any fees or rules, antitrust actions and government regulation relating to merchant pricing or terms of merchant rules and contracts could affect all networks directly or indirectly. For example, the European Commission’s (the Commission) decision to make binding Visa Europe’s commitments to cap its cross-border credit card multilateral interchange fees to 30 basis points and change its rules on how cross-border interchange is applied could negatively impact the discount revenue we derive from our business in the EU as a result of downward marketplace pressure on merchant fees, including our discount rates. Broad regulatory oversight over payment systems can also include, in some cases, requirements for international card networks to be locally licensed and/or to localize aspects of their operations. The development and enforcement of regulatory regimes may adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and extend our global network.

European Union Payments Legislation

In July 2013, the Commission proposed legislation in two parts, covering a wide range of topics across the payments industry. The first part was a proposed EU-wide regulation on interchange fees (the Interchange Fee Regulation); the second consisted of revisions to the Payment Services Directive (the PSD2). As part of the EU legislative process, these proposals have been subject to review by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, after which these institutions then meet with the Commission to finalize the legislation in a process known as a trialogue.

The Interchange Fee Regulation is now in the final stages of the legislative process following political agreement on its substantive content among the Council, the Parliament and the Commission in December 2014. Although the regulation is still subject to final review and formal adoption, the substantive terms agreed among the institutions include the following:

 

•	 	
Price caps — Interchange fees on consumer card transactions would be capped, generally at 20 basis points for debit and prepaid cards and 30 basis points for credit and charge cards, with opportunity for lower caps in some instances. Although we do not have interchange fees, as “four party” networks such as Visa and MasterCard have, and “three party” networks such as American Express are exempt from the application of the caps, the regulation provides that “three party” networks should be treated as “four party” networks when they license third party providers to issue cards and/or acquire merchants or when they issue cards with a co-brand partner or through an agent. This means, for example, the caps would apply to elements of the financial arrangements agreed to between us and each of our GNS partners in the EU. The caps would take effect six months after the regulation would become effective; however, the effectiveness of these caps in relation to our transactions with no cross-border component may be extended for a further three years. The discount rates we agree to

 

58

2014 FINANCIAL REVIEW

 

 	
with merchants would not be capped, but the interchange caps would likely exert additional downward pressures on merchant fees across the industry, including our discount rates, and may undermine our ability to attract and retain GNS partners. The Interchange Fee Regulation would exclude commercial card transactions from the scope of the caps.

 

•	 	
Card acceptance terms —“Anti-steering” and honor-all-cards rules across all card networks, including non-discrimination and honor-all-cards provisions in our card acceptance agreements, would be prohibited with some limited exceptions. Removal of these provisions creates significant risk of customer confusion and Card Member dissatisfaction, which would result in harm to the American Express brand. The prohibition on “anti-steering rules” would take effect immediately upon effectiveness of the regulation; the prohibition on honor-all-cards rules would take effect one year later.

 

•	 	
Network licensing — Beginning six months after the regulation would become effective, the geographic scope of network licenses, including those we agree to with our GNS partners, would cover the entire EU. This may undermine the value of licenses granted to some GNS partners to date, which have been subject to varying levels of exclusivity in relation to a particular country.

 

•	 	
Separation of network processing — Beginning one year after the date the regulation would become effective, card networks would be required to separate their network processing functions (in which transactions between different issuers and acquirers are processed for authorization, clearing and settlement). This proposal does not apply to three-party payment networks, such as American Express, but may be deemed applicable in situations where a different GNS issuer and acquirer is involved in a transaction, which represent a very small percentage of transactions on our network.

 

•	 	
Co-badging of cards — Beginning one year after the regulation would become effective, a single card may bear the brand of multiple networks and be used to process transactions on any of those networks. Merchants may install automatic mechanisms in point-of-sale equipment to prioritize selection of a particular network, subject to override by the cardholder. These provisions may harm the American Express brand insofar as GNS issuing partners will be able to offer multiple networks on a single card and merchants may program their point-of-sale equipment to prioritize selection of another network on such cards.

The Commission’s PSD2 proposal has been considered by both the Parliament and the Council; however, the trialogue process has only recently begun. Among other terms, the PSD2 could include in its final form provisions that would (i) further regulate surcharging so that transactions falling in scope of the interchange caps could not be surcharged, but transactions falling outside the scope of the caps could be surcharged up to cost, subject potentially to the ability of an individual Member State to prohibit surcharging altogether; and (ii) require all networks, including three-party payment networks that operate with licensing arrangements, such as our GNS business, to establish objective, proportionate and non-discriminatory criteria under which a financial institution may access the network, for example, as a licensed issuer or acquirer. The former may increase instances of differential surcharging of our cards and prompt customer and merchant confusion as to which transactions may be surcharged and Card Member dissatisfaction. The latter would undermine the flexibility and discretion we have had to date in deciding with whom to partner in our GNS business. Unlike the Interchange Fee Regulation, the PSD2 would require transposition into national law by each Member State, likely over a period of two years.

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) contains a wide array of provisions intended to govern the practices and oversight of financial institutions and other participants in the financial markets. Among other matters, the law created an independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the CFPB), which has broad rulemaking authority over providers of credit, savings, payment and other consumer financial products and services with respect to certain federal consumer financial laws. Moreover, the CFPB has examination and enforcement authority with respect to certain federal consumer financial laws for providers of consumer financial products and services, including American Express Company and certain of our subsidiaries. The CFPB is directed to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts or practices, and to ensure that all consumers have access to fair, transparent and competitive markets for consumer financial products and services.

The review of products and practices to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive conduct will be a continuing focus of the CFPB and banking regulators more broadly, as well as our own internal reviews. Internal and regulatory reviews have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, changes to our practices, products and procedures. Such reviews are also likely to continue to result in increased costs related to regulatory oversight, supervision and examination, and additional restitution to our Card Members and may result in additional regulatory actions, including civil money penalties.

2014 FINANCIAL REVIEW

 

In December 2013, we announced that certain of our subsidiaries reached settlements with several banking regulators, including the CFPB, to resolve regulatory reviews of marketing and billing practices related to several credit card add-on products. For a description of these settlements, see Part I, Item 3. “Legal Proceedings” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013.

In October 2012, we announced that American Express Company and certain of our subsidiaries reached settlements with several bank regulators, including the CFPB, relating to certain aspects of our U.S. consumer card practices. For a description of these settlements, see Part I, Item 3. “Legal Proceedings” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012.

Dodd-Frank prohibits payment card networks from restricting merchants from offering discounts or incentives to customers to pay with particular forms of payment, such as cash, check, credit or debit card, or restricting merchants from setting certain minimum, and for certain merchants maximum, transaction amounts for credit cards, as long as any such discounts or incentives or any minimum or maximum transaction amounts do not discriminate on the basis of the issuer or network and comply with applicable federal or state disclosure requirements.

Under Dodd-Frank, the Federal Reserve is also authorized to regulate interchange fees paid to financial institutions on debit card and certain general-use prepaid card transactions to ensure that they are “reasonable and proportional” to the cost of processing individual transactions, and to prohibit payment card networks and issuers from requiring transactions to be processed on a single payment network or fewer than two unaffiliated networks. The Federal Reserve’s rule provides that the regulations on interchange and routing do not apply to a three-party network like American Express when it acts as both the issuer and the network for prepaid cards, and we are therefore not a “payment card network” as that term is defined and used for the specific purposes of the rule.

Dodd-Frank also authorizes the Federal Reserve to establish enhanced prudential regulatory requirements, including capital, leverage and liquidity standards, risk management requirements, concentration limits on credit exposures, mandatory resolution plans (so-called “living wills”) and stress tests for, among others, large bank holding companies, such as American Express Company, that have greater than $50 billion in assets. We are also required to develop and maintain a “capital plan,” and to submit the capital plan to the Federal Reserve for our quantitative and qualitative review under the Federal Reserve’s CCAR process. In addition, certain derivative transactions are now required to be centrally cleared, which have increased our collateral posting requirements. In September 2014, the CFTC and the U.S. federal banking agencies issued proposals that would impose mandatory margining requirements for certain non-cleared swaps, which may further increase collateral posting requirements for us.

Department of Justice Litigation

The DOJ and certain states’ attorneys general have brought an action against us alleging that the provisions in our card acceptance agreements with merchants that prohibit merchants from discriminating against our card products at the point of sale violate the U.S. antitrust laws. On February 19, 2015, the trial court found that the challenged provisions were anticompetitive and will now determine the scope of the remedy when it enters judgment in the case. We intend to vigorously pursue an appeal of the decision and judgment. See Part I, Item 3. “Legal Proceedings” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 for descriptions of the DOJ action and related cases. Visa and MasterCard, which were also defendants in the DOJ and state action, entered into a settlement agreement and have been dismissed as parties pursuant to that agreement. The settlement enjoins Visa and MasterCard, with certain exceptions, from adopting or enforcing rules or entering into contracts that prohibit merchants from engaging in various actions to steer cardholders to other card products or payment forms at the point of sale. If similar conditions were imposed on American Express, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the potential impacts of an adverse decision on our business.

Other Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives

In certain countries, such as Australia, and in certain Member States in the EU, merchants are permitted by law to surcharge card purchases. While surcharging continues to be actively considered in certain jurisdictions, the benefits to customers have not been apparent in countries that have allowed it, and in some cases regulators are addressing concerns about excessive surcharging by merchants. Surcharging, particularly where it disproportionately impacts American Express Card Members, which is known as differential surcharging, could have a material adverse effect on us if it becomes widespread. The Reserve Bank of Australia allows us and other networks to limit a merchant’s right to surcharge to “the reasonable cost of card acceptance.” In the EU, the Consumer Rights Directive prohibits merchants from surcharging card purchases more than the merchants’ cost of acceptance in those Member States that permit surcharging.

Although neither a legislative nor regulatory initiative, the settlement by MasterCard and Visa in a U.S. merchant class litigation required, among other things, MasterCard and Visa to permit U.S. merchants, subject to certain conditions, to surcharge credit cards, while allowing them to continue to prohibit surcharges on debit and prepaid card transactions. In December 2013, we announced the proposed settlement of a number of U.S. merchant class action lawsuits, which, if approved, would change certain surcharging provisions in our U.S. card acceptance agreements. For a further description of the proposed settlement, see Part I, Item 3. “Legal Proceedings” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

Refer to the Recently Issued Accounting Standards section of Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

GLOSSARY OF SELECTED TERMINOLOGY

Adjusted average loans — Represents average Card Member loans excluding the impact of certain non-traditional Card Member loans and other fees.

Adjusted net interest income — Represents net interest income attributable to our Card Member loans portfolio excluding the impact of interest expense and interest income not attributable to our Card Member loans portfolio.

Asset securitizations — Asset securitization involves the transfer and sale of receivables or loans to a special-purpose entity created for the securitization activity, typically a trust. The trust, in turn, issues securities, commonly referred to as asset-backed securities that are secured by the transferred receivables or loans. The trust uses the proceeds from the sale of such securities to pay the purchase price for the underlying receivables or loans. The receivables and loans of our Charge Trust and Lending Trust being securitized are reported as assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Average discount rate — This calculation is generally designed to reflect pricing at merchants accepting general purpose American Express cards. It represents the percentage of billed business (generated from both proprietary and GNS Card Member spend) retained by us from merchants we acquire or, for merchants acquired by a third party on our behalf, net of amounts retained by such third party.

Basel III supplementary leverage ratio — Refer to the Capital Strategy section under “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity” for the definition.

Basic cards-in-force — Proprietary basic consumer cards-in-force includes basic cards issued to the primary account owner and does not include additional supplemental cards issued on that account. Proprietary basic small business and corporate cards-in-force include basic and supplemental cards issued to employee Card Members. Non-proprietary basic cards-in-force includes cards that are issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements, except for supplemental cards and retail co-brand Card Member accounts which have had no out-of-store spend activity during the prior 12-month period.

Billed business — Includes activities (including cash advances) related to proprietary cards, cards issued under network partnership agreements (non-proprietary billed business), corporate payments and certain insurance fees charged on proprietary cards. In-store spend activity within retail co-brand portfolios in GNS, from which we earn no revenue, is not included in non-proprietary billed business. Card billed business is included in the U.S. or outside the U.S. based on where the issuer is located.

Capital ratios — Represents the minimum standards established by the regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether the regulated entity has sufficient capital to absorb on- and off-balance sheet losses beyond current loss accrual estimates.

Card Member — The individual holder of an issued American Express-branded charge, credit card and certain prepaid cards.

Card Member loans — Represents the outstanding amount due from Card Members for charges made on their American Express credit cards, as well as any interest charges and card-related fees. Card Member loans also include revolving balances on certain American Express charge card products.

Card Member receivables — Represents the outstanding amount due from Card Members for charges made on their American Express charge cards as well as any card-related fees.

Charge cards — Represents cards that generally carry no pre-set spending limits and are primarily designed as a method of payment and not as a means of financing purchases. Charge Card Members generally must pay the full amount billed each month. No finance charges are assessed on charge cards. Each charge card transaction is authorized based on its likely economics reflecting a customer’s most recent credit information and spend patterns. Some charge card accounts have an additional lending-on-charge feature that allows revolving certain balances.

Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio — Refer to the Capital Strategy section under “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity” for the definitions under Transitional Basel III and Fully Phased-in Basel III.

Credit cards — Represents cards that have a range of revolving payment terms, grace periods, and rate and fee structures.

Discount revenue — Represents revenue earned from fees generally charged to merchants with whom we have entered into a card acceptance agreement for processing Card Member transactions. The discount fee generally is deducted from our payment reimbursing the merchant for Card Member purchases. Discount revenue is reduced by other payments made to merchants, third-party card issuing partners, cash-back reward costs, corporate incentive payments and other contra-revenue items.

Interest expense — Interest expense includes interest incurred primarily to fund Card Member loans, charge card product receivables, general corporate purposes, and liquidity needs, and is recognized as incurred. Interest expense is divided principally into two categories: (i) deposits, which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions, and (ii) debt, which primarily relates to interest expense on our long-term financing and short-term borrowings, which primarily relates to interest expense on commercial paper, federal funds purchased, bank overdrafts and other short-term borrowings.

Interest income — Interest income includes (i) interest on loans, (ii) interest and dividends on investment securities and (iii) interest income on deposits with banks and other.

Interest on loans — is assessed using the average daily balance method for loans. Unless the loan is classified as non-accrual, interest is recognized based upon the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the terms of the applicable account agreement until the outstanding balance is paid or written off.

Interest and dividends on investment securities — primarily relates to our performing fixed-income securities. Interest income is accrued as earned using the effective interest method, which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts, fees and other payments, so that the related investment security recognizes a constant rate of return on the outstanding balance throughout its term. These amounts are recognized until these securities are in default or when it is likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled.

Interest income on deposits with banks and other — is recognized as earned, and primarily relates to the placement of cash in excess of near-term funding requirements in interest-bearing time deposits, overnight sweep accounts, and other interest-bearing demand and call accounts.

Liquidity Coverage Ratio — Represents the proposed minimum standards being established by the regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether the regulated entity has sufficient liquidity to meet liquidity needs in periods of financial and economic stress.

Merchant acquisition — Represents the signing of merchants to accept American Express-branded cards.

Net card fees — Represents the card membership fees earned during the period. These fees are recognized as revenue over the covered card membership period (typically one year), net of provision for projected refunds for cancellation of card membership.

Net interest yield on Card Member loans — Net interest yield on Card Member loans is computed by dividing adjusted net interest income by adjusted average loans, computed on an annualized basis. The calculation of net interest yield on Card Member loans includes interest that is deemed uncollectible. For all presentations of net interest yield on Card Member loans, reserves and net write-offs related to uncollectible interest are recorded through provisions for losses — Card Member loans; therefore, such reserves and net write-offs are not included in the net interest yield calculation.

Net loss ratio — Represents the ratio of ICS and GCS charge card write-offs consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions) and fee components, less recoveries, on Card Member receivables expressed as a percentage of gross amounts billed to Card Members.

Net write-off rate — principal only — Represents the amount of Card Member loans or USCS and ICS Card Member receivables written off consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions), less recoveries, as a percentage of the average loan balance or USCS and ICS average receivables during the period.

Net write-off rate — principal, interest and fees — Includes, in the calculation of the net write-off rate, amounts for interest and fees in addition to principal for Card Member loans, and fees in addition to principal for USCS and ICS Card Member receivables.

Operating expenses — Represents salaries and employee benefits, professional services, occupancy and equipment, communications and other expenses.

Return on average equity — Calculated by dividing one-year period net income by one-year average total shareholders’ equity.

•	 	
the ability to maintain discipline over operating expenses during 2015 and 2016 as well as management’s ability to re-scale our expense base, which will depend in part on unanticipated increases in significant categories of operating expenses, such as consulting or professional fees, compliance or regulatory-related costs and technology costs, the payment of civil money penalties, disgorgement and restitution, our decision to increase or decrease discretionary operating expenses depending on overall business performance, our ability to achieve the expected benefits of our reengineering plans, our ability to balance expense control and investments in the business, the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on costs and results, the impact of accounting changes and reclassifications, and the level of acquisition activity and related expenses;

changes affecting our ability or desire to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our common shares in the first quarter of 2015, such as acquisitions, results of operations, capital needs and the amount of shares issued by us to employees upon the exercise of options, among other factors, which could significantly impact our capital ratios;

 

•	 	
changes affecting our ability or desire to issue preferred shares during the first quarter of 2015, such as actions by bank regulatory agencies, capital needs, any reduction in our credit ratings, which could materially increase the cost and other terms of preferred shares, and market conditions, among other factors;

 

•	 	
our funding plan for the full year 2015 being implemented in a manner inconsistent with current expectations, which will depend on various factors such as future business growth, the impact of global economic, political and other events on market capacity, demand for securities we offer, regulatory changes, ability to securitize and sell receivables and the performance of receivables previously sold in securitization transactions;

•	 	
our ability to meet our on-average and over-time growth targets for revenues net of interest expense, EPS and ROE, which will depend on factors such as our success in implementing our strategies and business initiatives including growing our share of overall spending, addressing the loss of the Costco U.S. relationship, retaining and growing our other co-brand and other partner relationships, increasing merchant coverage, enhancing our prepaid offerings, expanding the GNS business and controlling expenses, and on factors outside management’s control including the willingness and ability of Card Members to sustain spending, the effectiveness of marketing and loyalty programs, regulatory and market pressures on pricing, credit trends, changes in foreign currency exchange and interest rates, and changes in general economic conditions, such as GDP growth, consumer confidence, unemployment and the housing market;

 

•	 	
our ability to meet our on-average and over-time objective to return 50 percent of capital generated to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which will depend on factors such as approval of our capital plans by our regulators, the amount we spend on acquisitions, our results of operations and capital needs in any given period, and the amount of shares issued by us to employees upon the exercise of options;

litigation, such as class actions or proceedings brought by governmental and regulatory agencies (including the lawsuit filed against us by the U.S. Department of Justice and certain state attorneys general), that could result in (i) the imposition of behavioral remedies against us or us voluntarily making certain changes to our business practices, the effects of which in either case could have a material adverse impact on our business; (ii) the imposition of substantial monetary damages and penalties, disgorgement and restitution; and/or (iii) damage to our global reputation and brand;

 

•	 	
legal and regulatory developments wherever we do business, including legislative and regulatory reforms in the U.S., such as the actions of the CFPB and Dodd-Frank’s stricter regulation of large, interconnected financial institutions, which could make fundamental changes to many of our business practices or materially affect our capital or liquidity requirements, results of operations, or ability to pay dividends or repurchase our stock; actions and potential future actions by the FDIC and credit rating agencies applicable to securitization trusts, which could impact our ABS program; or potential changes to the taxation of our businesses, the allowance of deductions for significant expenses, or the incidence of consumption taxes on our transactions, products and services;

the impact of regulatory changes in the EU, including the introduction of price regulation, the elimination of honor all cards and “anti-steering” rules and requirements on granting access to our network, among other important changes, which will depend on various factors, including, but not limited to the actual final laws and regulations ultimately adopted in the EU and its Member States, including any exemptions and phase-in periods, our ability to adapt and change our business model to address regulatory requirements and competitive pressures, and our success in continuing to offer value propositions that potential partners, merchants and customers find attractive;
