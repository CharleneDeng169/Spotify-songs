INTRODUCTION Capital One Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation established in 1994 and headquartered in McLean, Virginia, is a diversified financial services holding company with banking and non-banking subsidiaries. Capital One Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company or Capital One ) offer a broad array of financial products and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients through digital channels, branch locations, caf and other distribution channels. As of September 30, 2023, Capital One Financial Corporation principal operating subsidiary was Capital One, National Association ( CONA ). On October 1, 2022, the Company completed the merger of Capital One Bank (USA), National Association ( COBNA ), with and into CONA, with CONA as the surviving entity (the Bank Merger ). The Company is hereafter collectively referred to as we, us or our. References to the Bank shall mean and refer to (i) CONA from and after the Bank Merger and (ii) CONA and COBNA collectively prior to the Bank Merger. Our consolidated total net revenues are derived primarily from lending to consumer and commercial customers net of funding costs associated with deposits, long-term debt and other borrowings. We also earn non-interest income which primarily consists of interchange income, net of reward expenses, service charges and other customer-related fees. Our expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating expenses, marketing expenses and income taxes. Our principal operations are organized for management reporting purposes into three major business segments, which are defined primarily based on the products and services provided or the types of customers served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into or managed as a part of our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability management by our centralized Corporate Treasury group, are included in the Other category. The Other category also includes unallocated corporate expenses that do not directly support the operations of the business segments or for which the business segments are not considered financially accountable in evaluating their performance, such as certain restructuring charges, as well as residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate that is not assessed to our primary business segments. Credit Card: Consists of our domestic consumer and small business card lending, and international card businesses in the United Kingdom ( U.K. ) and Canada. Consumer Banking: Consists of our deposit gathering and lending activities for consumers and small businesses, and national auto lending. 4 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Commercial Banking: Consists of our lending, deposit gathering, capital markets and treasury management services to commercial real estate and commercial and industrial customers. Our customers typically include companies with annual revenues between $20 million and $2 billion. Business Developments We regularly explore and evaluate opportunities to acquire financial products and services as well as financial assets, including credit card and other loan portfolios, and enter into strategic partnerships as part of our growth strategy. We also explore opportunities to acquire technology companies and related assets to improve our information technology infrastructure and to deliver on our digital strategy. We may issue equity or debt to fund our acquisitions. In addition, we regularly consider the potential disposition of certain of our assets, branches, partnership agreements or lines of business. 5 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA The following table presents selected consolidated financial data and performance from our results of operations for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 and 2022 and selected comparative balance sheet data as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. We also provide selected key metrics we use in evaluating our performance, including certain metrics that are computed using non-GAAP measures. We consider these metrics to be key financial measures that management uses in assessing our operating performance, capital adequacy and the level of returns generated. We believe these non-GAAP metrics provide useful insight to investors and users of our financial information as they provide an alternate measurement of our performance and assist in assessing our capital adequacy and the level of return generated. These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as a substitute for reported results determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ( U.S. GAAP ), nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP measures that may be presented by other companies.

In comparison, we reported net income of $1.7 billion ($4.20 per diluted common share) on total net revenue of $8.8 billion and net income of $6.1 billion ($14.84 per diluted common share) on total net revenue of $25.2 billion for the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio as calculated under the Basel III standardized approach was 13.0% and 12.5% as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. See Capital Management for additional information. In the third quarte r of 2023, we declared and paid common stock dividend s of $232 million and repurchased $150 million of shares of our common stock. During the first nine months of 2023, we declared and paid common stock dividends of $702 million and repurchased $450 million of shares of our common stock. See Capital Management Dividend Policy and Stock Purchases for additional information. Below are additional highlights of our performance in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023. These highlights are based on a comparison between the results of the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 and 2022, except as otherwise noted. The changes in our financial condition and credit performance are generally based on our financial condition and credit performance as of September 30, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022. We provide a more detailed discussion of our financial performance in the sections following this Executive Summary. Total Company Performance Earnings: Our net income increased by $96 million to $1.8 billion in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022 primarily driven by: Higher net interest income primarily driven by higher average loan balances in our credit card loan portfolio, partially offset by higher provision for credit losses primarily due to continued credit normalization. Our net income decreased by $1.9 billion to $4.2 billion in the first nine months of 2023 compared to the first nine months of 2022 primarily driven by: Higher provision for credit losses primarily driven by continued credit normalization, partially offset by higher net interest income primarily due to higher average loan balances in our credit card loan portfolio. Loans Held for Investment: Period-end loans held for investment increased by $2.4 billion to $314.8 billion as of September 30, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022 primarily driven by growth in our credit card loan portfolio. Average loans held for investment increased by $12.6 billion to $312.8 billion in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022 and increased by $22.8 billion to $310.1 billion in the first nine months of 2023 compared to the first nine months of 2022 primarily driven by growth in our credit card loan portfolio. Net Charge-Off and Delinquency Metrics: Our net charge-off rate increased by 132 basis points ( bps ) to 2.56% in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022 and increased by 135 bps to 2.53% in the first nine months of 2023 compared to the first nine months of 2022 primarily driven by continued credit normalization in our credit card loan portfolio. Our 30+ day delinquency rate increased by 50 bps to 3.71% as of September 30, 2023 from December 31, 2022 primarily driven by continued credit normalization in our credit card loan portfolio. Allowance for Credit Losses: Our allowance for credit losses increased by $1.7 billion to $15.0 billion and our allowance coverage ratio increased by 51 bps to 4.75% as of September 30, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022. 9 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The section below provides a comparative discussion of our consolidated financial performance for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 and 2022. We provide a discussion of our business segment results in the following section, Business Segment Financial Performance. This section should be read together with our Executive Summary, where we discuss trends and other factors that we expect will affect our future results of operations. Net Interest Income Net interest income represents the difference between interest income, including certain fees, earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense incurred on our interest-bearing liabilities. Our interest-earning assets include loans, investment securities and other interest-earning assets, while our interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing deposits, securitized debt obligations, senior and subordinated notes, other borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. Generally, we include in interest income any past due fees, net of reversals, on loans that we deem collectible. Our net interest margin, based on our consolidated results, represents the difference between the yield on our interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities, including the notional impact of non-interest-bearing funding. We expect net interest income and our net interest margin to fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 10 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 2 below presents the average outstanding balance, interest income earned, interest expense incurred and average yield for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 and 2022 for each major category of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Nonperforming loans are included in the average loan balances below.

Annualized interest income does not include any allocations, such as funds transfer pricing. Average yield is calculated using whole dollar values for average balances and interest income/expense. (2) Past due fees, net of reversals, included in interest income totaled approximately $593 million and $1.6 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively, and $534 million and $1.4 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively. (3) Some of our commercial investments generate tax-exempt income, tax credits or other tax benefits. Accordingly, we present our Commercial Banking revenue and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated using the federal statutory tax rate of 21% and state taxes where applicable, with offsetting reductions to the Other category. Taxable-equivalent adjustments included in the interest income and yield computations for our commercial loans totaled approximately $18 million and $55 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively, and $20 million and $56 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively, with corresponding reductions to the Other category. (4) Interest income/expense in the Other category represents the impact of hedge accounting on our loan portfolios and the offsetting reduction of the taxable-equivalent adjustments of our commercial loans as described above. ** Not meaningful. 12 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Net interest income increased by $420 million to $7.4 billion in the third quarter of 2023 and increased by $1.8 billion to $21.7 billion in the first nine months of 2023 primarily driven by higher asset yields and higher average loan balances in our credit card loan portfolio. Net interest margin decreased by 11 bps to 6.69% in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022 and decreased by 2 bps to 6.59% in the first nine months of 2023 compared to the first nine months of 2022. Table 3 displays the change in our net interest income between periods and the extent to which the variance is attributable to: changes in the volume of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities; or changes in the interest rates related to these assets and liabilities.

The portion of interest income or interest expense attributable to both volume and rate is allocated proportionately when the calculation results in a positive value. When the portion of interest income or interest expense attributable to both volume and rate results in a negative value, the total amount is allocated to volume or rate, depending on which amount is positive. (2) Some of our commercial investments generate tax-exempt income, tax credits or other tax benefits. Accordingly, we present our Commercial Banking revenue and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated using the federal statutory tax rate of 21% and state taxes where applicable, with offsetting reductions to the Other category. (3) Interest income/expense in the Other category represents the impact of hedge accounting on our loan portfolios and the offsetting reduction of the taxable-equivalent adjustments of our commercial loans as described above. 13 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Non-Interest Income Table 4 displays the components of non-interest income for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 and 2022.

(2) Includes losses of $13 million and gains of $36 million on deferred compensation plan investments in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively, and losses of $19 million and $106 million on deferred compensation plan investments in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively. These amounts have corresponding offsets in non-interest expense. Non-interest income increased by $141 million to $1.9 billion in the third quarter of 2023 and increased by $266 million to $5.6 billion in the first nine months of 2023 primarily driven by higher treasury income due to higher interest rates and higher net interchange fees due to an increase in purchase volume. Provision for Credit Losses Our provision for credit losses in each period is driven by net charge-offs, changes to the allowance for credit losses and changes to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. Our provision for credit losses increased by $615 million to $2.3 billion in the third quarter of 2023 primarily driven by continued credit normalization, partially offset by a lower net allowance build. Our provision for credit losses increased by $4.1 billion to $7.6 billion in the first nine months of 2023 primarily driven by continued credit normalization and net allowance builds. We provide additional information on the provision for credit losses and changes in the allowance for credit losses within Credit Risk Profile and Part I Item 1.

These amounts have corresponding offsets from investments in other non-interest income. Non-interest expense remained substantially flat at $4.9 billion in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022. Non-interest expense increased by $516 million to $14.6 billion in the first nine months of 2023 primarily driven by increased salaries and associate benefits, partially offset by lower professional services and marketing spend. Income Taxes We recorded an income tax provision of $432 million (19.4% effective income tax rate) and $932 million (18.2% effective income tax rate) in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively, compared to an income tax provision of $493 million (22.5% effective income tax rate) and $1.6 billion (20.4% effective income tax rate) in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively. Our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations varies between periods due, in part, to the impact of changes in pre-tax income and changes in tax credits, tax-exempt income and non-deductible expenses relative to our pre-tax earnings.

Total liabilities increased by $15.1 billion to $417.8 billion as of September 30, 2023 from December 31, 2022 primarily driven by deposit growth due to our national consumer banking strategy. Stockholders equity increased by $1.1 billion to $53.7 billion as of September 30, 2023 from December 31, 2022 primarily driven by net income of $4.2 billion, partially offset by an increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss due to a decline in the fair value of our investment securities portfolio. The following is a discussion of material changes in the major components of our assets and liabilities during the first nine months of 2023. Period-end balance sheet amounts may vary from average balance sheet amounts due to liquidity and balance sheet management activities that are intended to support the adequacy of capital while managing our liquidity requirements, our customers and our market risk exposure in accordance with our risk appetite. Investment Securities Our investment securities portfolio consists of the following: U.S. government-sponsored enterprise or agency ( Agency ) and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities ( RMBS ), agency commercial mortgage-backed securities ( CMBS ), U.S. Treasury securities and other securities. Agency securities include Government National Mortgage Association ( Ginnie Mae ) guaranteed securities, Federal National Mortgage Association ( Fannie Mae ) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( Freddie Mac ) issued securities. The carrying value of our investments in Agency and U.S. Treasury securities represented 97% of our total investment securities portfolio as of both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio decreased by $2.1 billion to $74.8 billion as of September 30, 2023 from December 31, 2022, primarily driven by declines in fair value due to increases in interest rates. See Part I Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 2 Investment Securities for more information. Loans Held for Investment Total loans held for investment consists of both unsecuritized loans and loans held in our consolidated trusts. Table 6 summarizes, by portfolio segment, the carrying value of our loans held for investment, the allowance for credit losses and net loan balance as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

We provide additional information on the composition of our loan portfolio and credit quality in Credit Risk Profile, Consolidated Results of Operations and Part I Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 3 Loans. Funding Sources Our primary source of funding comes from retail deposits, as they are a relatively stable and lower cost source of funding. In addition to deposits, we raise funding through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, securitized debt obligations, federal funds purchased, securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, and Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB ) advances secured by certain portions of our loan and securities portfolios. 16 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 7 provides the composition of our primary sources of funding as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

(2) As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , we held $68.3 billion and $80.7 billion , respectively, of estimated uninsured deposits excluding any intercompany balances. These amounts are primarily comprised of checking and savings deposits. These estimated uninsured deposits comprise approximately 20% and 24% of our total deposits as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , respectively. We estimate our uninsured amounts based on methodologies and assumptions used for our Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (FFIEC 031) filed with the Federal Banking Agencies. Total deposits increased by $13.0 billion to $346.0 billion as of September 30, 2023 from December 31, 2022 primarily driven by our national banking strategy. Securitized debt obligations increased by $444 million to $17.4 billion as of September 30, 2023 from December 31, 2022 primarily driven by net issuances in our credit card securitization program, partially offset by net paydowns in our auto securitization program. Other debt increased by $88 million to $31.8 billion as of September 30, 2023 from December 31, 2022 primarily driven by net issuances of senior debt, partially offset by maturities of subordinated debt. We provide additional information on our funding sources in Liquidity Risk Profile and Part I Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 7 Deposits and Borrowings. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS In the ordinary course of business, we engage in certain activities that are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets, generally referred to as off-balance sheet arrangements. These activities typically involve transactions with unconsolidated variable interest entities ( VIEs ) as well as other arrangements, such as letters of credit, loan commitments and guarantees, to meet the financing needs of our customers and support their ongoing operations. We provide additional information regarding these types of activities in Part I Item 1.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 13 Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others. 17 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents BUSINESS SEGMENT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE Our principal operations are organized for management reporting purposes into three major business segments, which are defined primarily based on the products and services provided or the types of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into or managed as a part of our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio, asset/liability management by our centralized Corporate Treasury group and residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate that is not assessed to our primary business segments, are included in the Other category. The results of our individual businesses, which we report on a continuing operations basis, reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources. We may periodically change our business segments or reclassify business segment results based on modifications to our management reporting methodologies and changes in organizational alignment. Our business segment results are intended to reflect each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. We use an internal management and reporting process to derive our business segment results. Our internal management and reporting process employs various allocation methodologies, including funds transfer pricing, to assign certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenues and expenses directly or indirectly attributable to each business segment. Total interest income and non-interest income are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported. The net interest income of each segment reflects the results of our funds transfer pricing process, which is primarily based on a matched funding concept that takes into consideration market interest rates. Our funds transfer pricing process is managed by our centralized Corporate Treasury group and provides a funds credit for sources of funds, such as deposits generated by our Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking businesses, and a charge for the use of funds by each segment. The allocation is unique to each business segment and acquired business and is based on the composition of assets and liabilities. The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet products. Periodically, the methodology and assumptions utilized in the funds transfer pricing process are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other factors, which may impact the allocation of net interest income to the business segments. We regularly assess the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, which may result in the implementation of refinements or changes in future periods. We provide additional information on the allocation methodologies used to derive our business segment results in Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 17 Business Segments and Revenue from Contracts with Customers in our 2022 Form 10-K. We refer to the business segment results derived from our internal management accounting and reporting process as our managed presentation, which differs in some cases from our reported results prepared based on U.S. GAAP. There is no comprehensive authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to U.S. GAAP; therefore, the managed presentation of our business segment results may not be comparable to similar information provided by other financial services companies. In addition, our individual business segment results should not be used as a substitute for comparable results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We summarize our business segment results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 and 2022 and provide a comparative discussion of these results, as well as changes in our financial condition and credit performance metrics as of September 30, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022.

Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income increased by $59 million to $1.5 billion in the third quarter of 2023 due to higher net interchange fees due to an increase in purchase volume. Non-interest income increased by $53 million to $4.4 billion in the first nine months of 2023 due to higher net interchange fees due to an increase in purchase volume, partially offset by the absence of the gain on the sale of partnership loan portfolios in 2022. Provision for Credit Losses: Provision for credit losses increased by $692 million to $2.0 billion in the third quarter of 2023 primarily driven by continued credit normalization, partially offset by a lower allowance build. Provision for credit losses increased by $3.9 billion to $6.3 billion in the first nine months of 2023 primarily driven by continued credit normalization and allowance builds. Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense remained substantially flat at $3.0 billion in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022. Non-interest expense increased by $515 million to $9.1 billion in the first nine months of 2023 primarily driven by increased operating expenses, including salaries and associate benefits. Loans Held for Investment: Period-end loans held for investment increased by $9.1 billion to $146.8 billion as of September 30, 2023 from December 31, 2022 driven by growth across our portfolio.

Finance charges and fees charged off as uncollectible are reflected as a reduction in total net revenue. (2) Average yield is calculated based on annualized interest income for the period divided by average loans during the period and does not include any allocations, such as funds transfer pricing. (3) Total net revenue margin is calculated based on annualized total net revenue for the period divided by average loans during the period. Because our Domestic Card business accounts for the substantial majority of our Credit Card business, the key factors driving the results are similar to the key factors affecting our total Credit Card business. Net income for our Domestic Card business increased in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022 primarily driven by: Higher net interest income primarily driven by higher average loan balances, partially offset by higher provision for credit losses primarily driven by continued credit normalization. Net income for our Domestic Card business decreased in the first nine months of 2023 compared to the first nine months of 2022 primarily driven by: Higher provision for credit losses primarily driven by continued credit normalization and allowance builds, partially offset by higher net interest income primarily driven by higher average loan balances. 22 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Consumer Banking Business The primary sources of revenue for our Consumer Banking business are net interest income from loans and deposits as well as service charges and customer-related fees.

Key factors affecting the results of our Consumer Banking business for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 include the following: Net Interest Income: Net interest income decreased by $178 million to $2.1 billion in the third quarter of 2023 primarily driven by lower margins in our retail banking business and lower average loan balances in our auto business, partially offset by higher deposits in our retail banking business. Net interest income increased by $191 million to $6.8 billion in the first nine months of 2023 primarily driven by higher deposits in our retail banking business, partially offset by lower margins in our auto business. Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income remained substantially flat at $142 million in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022. Non-interest income increased by $96 million to $426 million in the first nine months of 2023 primarily driven by higher interchange fees from an increase in debit card purchase volume. Provision for Credit Losses: Provision for credit losses decreased by $72 million to $213 million in the third quarter of 2023 primarily driven by an improved economic environment. Provision for credit losses increased by $51 million to $747 million in the first nine months of 2023 primarily driven by continued credit normalization. Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense decreased by $78 million to $1.3 billion in the third quarter of 2023 and decreased by $86 million to $3.8 billion in the first nine months of 2023 primarily driven by lower auto originations. Loans Held for Investment: Period-end loans held for investment decreased by $3.1 billion to $76.8 billion as of September 30, 2023 from December 31, 2022 primarily driven by customer payments outpacing originations in auto. Average loans held for investment decreased by $4.2 billion to $77.2 billion in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022 and decreased by $2.4 billion to $77.9 billion in the first nine months of 2023 compared to the first nine months of 2022 primarily driven by lower auto loan originations. Deposits: Period-end deposits increased by $20.2 billion to $290.8 billion as of September 30, 2023 from December 31, 2022 primarily driven by our national banking strategy. Net Charge-Off and Delinquency Metrics: The net charge-off rate increased by 71 bps to 1.81% in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022 and increased by 76 bps to 1.60% in the first nine months of 2023 compared to the first nine months of 2022 primarily driven by continued credit normalization in our auto loan portfolio. The 30+ day delinquency rate remained substantially flat at 6.27% as of September 30, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022. 24 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Commercial Banking Business The primary sources of revenue for our Commercial Banking business are net interest income from loans and deposits and non-interest income earned from products and services provided to our clients such as advisory services, capital markets and treasury management.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make a number of judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses on the consolidated financial statements. Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We provide a summary of our significant accounting policies under Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our 2022 Form 10-K. We have identified the following accounting estimates as critical because they require significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Our critical accounting policies and estimates are as follows: Loan loss reserves Goodwill Fair value Customer rewards reserve We evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and update them as necessary, based on changing conditions. 28 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Goodwill We perform our goodwill impairment test annually on October 1 at a reporting unit level. As of our last annual test and as of September 30, 2023, we had four reporting units: Credit Card, Auto, Other Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. We are also required to test goodwill for impairment when a triggering event occurs that indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount. The results of the 2022 annual goodwill impairment test for the Commercial Banking reporting unit indicated that the estimated fair value of the Commercial Banking reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by 17%. Outside of our annual impairment testing process, we monitor our reporting units for any triggering events while also performing qualitative assessments of impairment indicators. During the third quarter, we concluded there were no triggering events and completed our qualitative assessment of impairment indicators, which included, among other things, an assessment of changes in macroeconomic conditions, comparison of the actual results to those forecasted in the most recent annual impairment test and performing sensitivity analysis on key assumptions. Though this qualitative assessment concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Commercial Banking reporting unit remained in excess of the carrying value as of September 30, 2023, the amount by which the estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value is estimated to have declined relative to the results of the 2022 annual impairment test. We are currently in the process of performing our 2023 annual impairment test, the results of which will be disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K. Assumptions used in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit are judgmental and inherently uncertain. A change in the economic conditions of a reporting unit, such as declines in business performance as a result of industry or macroeconomic trends or changes in our strategy, adverse impacts to loan or deposit growth trends, decreases in revenue, increases in expenses, increases in credit losses, increases in capital requirements, deterioration of market conditions, declines in long-term growth expectations, adverse impacts of regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated cost of capital could cause the estimated fair values of our reporting units to decline in the future, and increase the risk of a goodwill impairment in a future period. There have been no additional changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates described in our 2022 Form 10-K under Part II Item 7. MD&A Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. ACCOUNTING CHANGES AND DEVELOPMENTS Accounting Standards Issued but Not Adopted as of September 30, 2023 Standard Guidance Adoption Timing and Financial Statement Impacts Tax Credit Investments ASU 2023-02, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method Issued March 2023 The amendments in this update permit reporting entities to elect to account for their tax equity investments, regardless of tax credit program from which the income tax credits are received, using the proportional amortization method, if certain criteria are met. Previously, only Low-Income Housing Tax Credit investments were eligible to apply the proportional amortization method. This ASU becomes effective for us on January 1, 2024, with early adoption permitted and can be adopted using either a retrospective or modified retrospective transition method. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 29 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The level and composition of our capital are determined by multiple factors, including our consolidated regulatory capital requirements as described in more detail below and internal risk-based capital assessments such as internal stress testing. The level and composition of our capital may also be influenced by rating agency guidelines, subsidiary capital requirements, business environment, conditions in the financial markets and assessments of potential future losses due to adverse changes in our business and market environments. Capital Standards and Prompt Corrective Action The Company and the Bank are subject to the regulatory capital requirements established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ( Federal Reserve ) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ), respectively (the Basel III Capital Rules ). The Basel III Capital Rules implement certain capital requirements published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ( Basel Committee ), along with certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 ( Dodd-Frank Act ) and other capital provisions. As a bank holding company ( BHC ) with total consolidated assets of at least $250 billion but less than $700 billion and not exceeding any of the applicable risk-based thresholds, the Company is a Category III institution under the Basel III Capital Rules. The Bank, as a subsidiary of a Category III institution, is a Category III bank. Moreover, the Bank, as an insured depository institution, is subject to prompt corrective action ( PCA ) capital regulations. Basel III and United States Capital Rules Under the Basel III Capital Rules, we must maintain a minimum common equity Tier 1 ( CET1 ) capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% and a total capital ratio of 8.0%, in each case in relation to risk-weighted assets. In addition, we must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0% and a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3.0%. We are also subject to the capital conservation buffer requirement and countercyclical capital buffer requirement, each as described below. Our capital and leverage ratios are calculated based on the Basel III standardized approach framework. We have elected to exclude certain elements of accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) from our regulatory capital as permitted for a Category III institution. Global systemically important banks ( G-SIBs ) that are based in the U.S. are subject to an additional CET1 capital requirement known as the G-SIB Surcharge. We are not a G-SIB based on the most recent available data and thus we are not subject to a G-SIB Surcharge. Stress Capital Buffer Rule The Basel III Capital Rules require banking institutions to maintain a capital conservation buffer, composed of CET1 capital, above the regulatory minimum ratios. Under the Federal Reserve final rule to implement the stress capital buffer requirement (the Stress Capital Buffer Rule ), the Company standardized approach capital conservation buffer includes its stress capital buffer requirement (as described below), any G-SIB Surcharge (which is not applicable to us) and the countercyclical capital buffer requirement (which is currently set at 0%) . Any determination to increase the countercyclical capital buffer generally would be effective twelve months after the announcement of such an increase, unless the Federal Reserve, OCC and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ), hereafter collectively referred to as the Federal Banking Agencies, set an earlier effective date. The Company stress capital buffer requirement is recalibrated every year based on the Company supervisory stress test results. In particular, the Company stress capital buffer requirement equals, subject to a floor of 2.5%, the sum of (i) the difference between the Company starting CET1 capital ratio and its lowest projected CET1 capital ratio under the severely adverse scenario of the Federal Reserve supervisory stress test plus (ii) the ratio of the Company projected four quarters of common stock dividends (for the fourth to seventh quarters of the planning horizon) to the projected risk-weighted assets for the quarter in which the Company projected CET1 capital ratio reaches its minimum under the supervisory stress test. Based on the Company 2022 supervisory stress test results, the Company stress capital buffer requirement for the period beginning on October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023 was 3.1% . Therefore, the Company minimum capital requirements 30 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents plus the standardized approach capital conservation buffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios under the stress capital buffer framework were 7.6%, 9.1% and 11.1%, respectively, for the period from October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023 . Based on the Company 2023 supervisory stress test results, the Company stress capital buffer requirement for the period beginning on October 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024 is 4.8%. Therefore, the Company minimum capital requirements plus the standardized approach capital conservation buffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios under the stress capital buffer framework are 9.3%, 10.8% and 12.8%, respectively, for the period from October 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024. The Stress Capital Buffer Rule does not apply to the Bank. The capital conservation buffer for the Bank continues to be fixed at 2.5%. Accordingly, the Bank minimum capital requirements plus its capital conservation buffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios are 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5%, respectively. If the Company or the Bank fails to maintain its capital ratios above the minimum capital requirements plus the applicable capital conservation buffer requirements, it will face increasingly strict automatic limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to certain executive officers. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, the Company and the Bank each exceeded the minimum capital requirements and the capital conservation buffer requirements applicable to them, and the Company and the Bank were each well-capitalized. The well-capitalized standards applicable to the Company are established in the Federal Reserve regulations, and the well-capitalized standards applicable to the Bank are established in the OCC PCA capital requirements. Market Risk Rule The Market Risk Rule supplements the Basel III Capital Rules by requiring institutions subject to the rule to adjust their risk-based capital ratios to reflect the market risk in their trading book. The Market Risk Rule generally applies to institutions with aggregate trading assets and liabilities equal to 10% or more of total assets or $1 billion or more. As of September 30, 2023, the Company and the Bank are subject to the Market Risk Rule. See Market Risk Profile below for additional information. CECL Transition Rule The Federal Banking Agencies adopted a final rule (the CECL Transition Rule ) that provides banking institutions an optional five-year transition period to phase in the impact of the current expected credit losses ( CECL ) standard on their regulatory capital (the CECL Transition Election ). We adopted the CECL standard (for accounting purposes) as of January 1, 2020, and made the CECL Transition Election (for regulatory capital purposes) in the first quarter of 2020. Therefore, the applicable amounts presented in this Report reflect such election. Pursuant to the CECL Transition Rule, a banking institution could elect to delay the estimated impact of adopting CECL on its regulatory capital through December 31, 2021 and then phase in the estimated cumulative impact from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. For the day 2 ongoing impact of CECL during the initial two years, the Federal Banking Agencies used a uniform scaling factor of 25% as an approximation of the increase in the allowance under the CECL standard compared to the prior incurred loss methodology. Accordingly, from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021, electing banking institutions were permitted to add back to their regulatory capital an amount equal to the sum of the after-tax day 1 CECL adoption impact and 25% of the increase in the allowance since the adoption of the CECL standard. From January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024, the after-tax day 1 CECL adoption impact and the cumulative day 2 ongoing impact are being phased in to regulatory capital at 25% per year. The following table summarizes the capital impact delay and phase in period on our regulatory capital from years 2020 to 2025. Capital Impact Delayed Phase In Period 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 Day 1 CECL adoption impact Capital impact delayed to 2022 25% Phased In 50% Phased In 75% Phased In Fully Phased In Cumulative day 2 ongoing impact 25% scaling factor as an approximation of the increase in allowance under CECL 31 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents As of December 31, 2021, we added back an aggregate amount of $2.4 billion to our regulatory capital pursuant to the CECL Transition Rule. Consistent with the rule, we have phased in 50% of this amount, leaving $1.2 billion to be phased in over 2024-2025. As of September 30, 2023, the Company CET1 capital ratio, reflecting the CECL Transition Rule, was 13.0 % and would have been 12.7% excluding the impact of the CECL Transition Rule (or on a fully phased-in basis ). For the description of the regulatory capital rules to which we are subject, see Part I Item 1. Business Supervision and Regulation in our 2022 Form 10-K. For a description of proposed amendments to these regulatory capital rules, see Supervision and Regulation in this Report.

Capital Planning and Regulatory Stress Testing We repurchased $150 million of shares of our common stock during the third quarter of 2023 and $450 million of shares of our common stock during the first nine months of 2023. On July 27, 2023, the Federal Reserve confirmed and announced individual stress capital buffer requirements for all large banking institutions, including the Company. The Company final stress capital buffer requirement for the period beginning on October 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024 is 4.8%. Therefore, the Company minimum capital requirements plus the standardized approach capital conservation buffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios under the stress capital buffer framework are 9.3%, 10.8% and 12.8%, respectively, for the period from October 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024.

Prior period amounts presented have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. (2) The funded balance for commercial office real estate held for investment totaled $2.4 billion, or 3%, and $4.0 billion, or 4%, as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Commercial office real estate exposure does not include loans in our healthcare real estate business secured by medical office properties and loans to office real estate investment trusts or real estate investment funds. Credit Risk Measurement We closely monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to assess and manage our exposure to credit risk. Trends in delinquency rates are the key credit quality indicator for our credit card and retail banking loan portfolios as changes in delinquency rates can provide an early warning of changes in potential future credit losses. The key indicator we monitor when assessing the credit quality and risk of our auto loan portfolio is borrower credit scores as they provide insight into borrower risk profiles, which give indications of potential future credit losses. The key credit quality indicator for our commercial loan portfolios is our internal risk ratings as we generally classify loans that have been delinquent for an extended period of time and other loans with significant risk of loss as nonperforming. In addition to these credit quality indicators, we also manage and monitor other credit quality metrics such as level of nonperforming loans and net charge-off rates. We underwrite most consumer loans using proprietary models, which typically include credit bureau data, such as borrower credit scores, application information and, where applicable, collateral and deal structure data. We continuously adjust our management of credit lines and collection strategies based on customer behavior and risk profile changes. We also use borrower credit scores for subprime classification, for competitive benchmarking and, in some cases, to drive product segmentation decisions. Table 21 provides details on the credit scores of our domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

Domestic Card credit scores generally represent FICO scores. These scores are obtained from one of the major credit bureaus at origination and are refreshed monthly thereafter. We approximate non-FICO credit scores to comparable FICO scores for consistency purposes. Balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 660 or below category. (2) Percentages represent period-end loans held for investment in each credit score category. Auto credit scores generally represent average Fair Isaac Corporation ( FICO ) scores obtained from three credit bureaus at the time of application and are not refreshed thereafter. Balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 620 or below category. In our commercial loan portfolio, we assign internal risk ratings to loans based on relevant information about the ability of the borrowers to repay their debt. In determining the risk rating of a particular loan, some of the factors considered are the borrower current financial condition, historical and projected future credit performance, prospects for support from financially responsible guarantors, the estimated realizable value of any collateral and current economic trends. We present information in the section below on the credit performance of our loan portfolio, including the key metrics we use in tracking changes in the credit quality of our loan portfolio. See Part I Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 3 Loans for additional credit quality information and see Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our 2022 Form 10-K for information on our accounting policies for delinquent and nonperforming loans, charge-offs and troubled debt restructurings ( TDRs ) for each of our loan categories. Delinquency Rates We consider the entire balance of an account to be delinquent if the minimum required payment is not received by the customer due date, measured at each balance sheet date. Our 30+ day delinquency metrics include all loans held for investment that are 30 or more days past due, whereas our 30+ day performing delinquency metrics include all loans held for investment that are 30 or more days past due but are currently classified as performing and accruing interest. The 30+ day delinquency and 30+ day performing delinquency metrics are the same for domestic credit card loans, as we continue to classify these loans as performing until the account is charged off, typically when the account is 180 days past due. See Part II Item 8.

Nonperforming Loans and Nonperforming Assets Nonperforming loans include loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status. Nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans, repossessed assets and other foreclosed assets. See Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our 2022 Form 10-K for information on our policies for classifying loans as nonperforming for each of our loan categories. Table 25 presents our nonperforming loans, by portfolio segment, and other nonperforming assets as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

Interest income foregone related to nonperforming loans was $91 million and $59 million in the first nine months of 2023 and 2022, respectively. Foregone interest income represents the amount of interest income in excess of recognized interest income that would have been recorded during the period for nonperforming loans as of the end of the period had the loans performed according to their contractual terms. (2) Nonperforming loan rates are calculated based on nonperforming loans for each category divided by period-end total loans held for investment for each respective category. (3) Excluding the impact of domestic credit card loans, nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans held for investment was 0.87% and 0.74% as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. (4) The denominators used in calculating nonperforming asset rates consist of total loans held for investment and other nonperforming assets. 43 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Net Charge-Offs Net charge-offs consist of the amortized cost basis, excluding accrued interest, of loans held for investment that we determine to be uncollectible, net of recovered amounts. We charge off loans as a reduction to the allowance for credit losses when we determine the loan is uncollectible and record subsequent recoveries of previously charged off amounts as increases to the allowance for credit losses. Uncollectible finance charges and fees are reversed through revenue and certain fraud losses are recorded in other non-interest expense. Generally, costs to recover charged off loans are recorded as collection expenses as incurred and are included in our consolidated statements of income as a component of other non-interest expense. Our charge-off policy for loans varies based on the loan type. See Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our 2022 Form 10-K for information on our charge-off policy for each of our loan categories.

The ASU eliminates the accounting guidance for TDRs and establishes disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancing and restructurings for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, which results in a more than insignificant impact to the timing or amount of contractual cash flows. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2022-02, a modification was deemed a TDR when the contractual terms of a loan agreement were modified by granting a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. ASU 2022-02 eliminated the concession requirement for modifications. After the adoption of ASU 2022-02, a financial difficulty modification ( FDM ) occurs when a modification in the form of principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, an other-than-insignificant payment delay, a term extension or a combination of these modifications is granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. The types of modifications we offer to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty have not changed as a result of the adoption of ASU 2022-02. As part of our loss mitigation efforts, we may provide short-term (one to twelve months) or long-term (greater than twelve months) modifications to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty to improve long-term collectability of the loan and to avoid the need for repossession or foreclosure of collateral. We consider the impact of all loan modifications, including FDMs, when estimating the credit quality of our loan portfolio and establishing allowance levels. For our Commercial Banking customers, loan modifications are also considered in the assignment of an internal risk rating. In our Credit Card business, the majority of our FDMs receive an interest rate reduction and are placed on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months. The effective interest rate on the loan immediately prior to the loan modification is used as the effective interest rate for purposes of measuring impairment using the present value of expected cash flows. If the customer does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan agreement may revert to its original payment terms, generally resulting in any loan outstanding being reflected in the appropriate delinquency category and charged off in accordance with our standard charge-off policy. In our Consumer Banking business, the majority of our FDMs receive an extension, an interest rate reduction, principal reduction, or a combination of these modifications. Impairment is determined using the present value of expected cash flows or a collateral evaluation for certain auto loans where the collateral value is lower than the amortized cost. In our Commercial Banking business, the majority of our FDMs receive an extension. A portion of FDMs receive an interest rate reduction, principal reduction, or a combination of modifications. For additional information on accounting standards adopted during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, see Part I Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. For more information on FDMs in the third quarter of 2023 and TDRs in the third quarter of 2022, see Part I Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 3 Loans. Allowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments Our allowance for credit losses represents management current estimate of expected credit losses over the contractual terms of our loans held for investment as of each balance sheet date. Expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off or expected to be charged off are recognized within the allowance. We also estimate expected credit losses related to unfunded lending commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable. The provision for losses on unfunded lending commitments is included in the provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of income and the related reserve for unfunded lending commitments is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We provide additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used in determining our allowance for credit losses in Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our 2022 Form 10-K.

The initial allowance of purchased credit-deteriorated loans was $0 million and $32 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, and $10 million for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. (3) Impact from the adoption of ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures as of January 1, 2023. LIQUIDITY RISK PROFILE We have established liquidity practices that are intended to ensure that we have sufficient asset-based liquidity to cover our funding requirements and maintain adequate reserves to withstand the potential impact of deposit attrition or diminished liquidity in the funding markets. In addition to our cash and cash equivalents, we maintain liquidity reserves in the form of investment securities and certain loans that are either readily-marketable or pledgeable. 47 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents -Table 28 below presents the composition of our liquidity reserves as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Table 28: Liquidity Reserves (Dollars in millions) September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Cash and cash equivalents $ 44,869 $ 30,856 Securities available for sale 74,837 76,919 FHLB borrowing capacity secured by loans 5,565 6,436 Outstanding FHLB advances and letters of credit secured by loans and investment securities (50) (51) Other encumbrances of investment securities (6,869) (7,583) Total liquidity reserves $ 118,352 $ 106,577 Our liquidity reserves increased by $11.8 billion to $118.4 billion as of September 30, 2023 from December 31, 2022, primarily due to increases in cash and cash equivalents. In addition to these liquidity reserves, we maintain access to a diversified mix of funding sources as discussed in the Borrowing Capacity and Funding sections below. See Part II Item 7. MD&A Risk Management in our 2022 Form 10-K for additional information on our management of liquidity risk. Liquidity Coverage Ratio We are subject to the liquidity coverage ratio ( LCR ) standard as implemented by the Federal Reserve and the OCC (the LCR Rule ). The LCR Rule requires each of the Company and the Bank to calculate its respective LCR daily. It also requires the Company to publicly disclose, on a quarterly basis, its LCR, certain related quantitative liquidity metrics, and a qualitative discussion of its LCR. Our average LCR during the third quarter of 2023 was 155%, which exceeded the LCR Rule requirement of 100%. The calculation and the underlying components are based on our interpretations, expectations and assumptions of relevant regulations, as well as interpretations provided by our regulators, and are subject to change based on changes to future regulations and interpretations. See Part I Item 1. Business Supervision and Regulation in our 2022 Form 10-K for additional information. Net Stable Funding Ratio We are subject to the net stable funding ratio ( NSFR ) standard as implemented by the Federal Reserve and the OCC (the NSFR Rule ). The NSFR Rule requires each of the Company and the Bank to maintain an NSFR of 100% on an ongoing basis. It also requires the Company to publicly disclose, on a semi-annual basis each second and fourth quarter, its NSFR, certain related quantitative liquidity metrics and qualitative discussion of its NSFR. Our average NSFR for the third quarter of 2023 exceeded the NSFR Rule requirement of 100%. The calculation and the underlying components are based on our interpretations, expectations and assumptions of the relevant regulations, as well as interpretations provided by our regulators, and are subject to change based on changes to future regulations and interpretations. See Part I Item 1. Business Supervision and Regulation in our 2022 Form 10-K for additional information. Borrowing Capacity We maintain a shelf registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) so that we may periodically offer and sell an indeterminate aggregate amount of senior or subordinated debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock, purchase contracts, warrants and units. There is no limit under this shelf registration to the amount or number of such securities that we may offer and sell, subject to market conditions. In addition, we also maintain a shelf registration associated with our credit card securitization trust that allows us to periodically offer and sell up to $30 billion of securitized debt obligations and a shelf registration associated with our auto loan securitization trusts that allows us to periodically offer and sell up to $25 billion of securitized debt obligations. The registered amounts under these shelf registration statements are subject to continuing review and change in the future, including as part of the routine renewal process. 48 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents In addition to our issuance capacity under the shelf registration statements, we also have pledged collateral to support our access to FHLB advances, the Federal Reserve Discount Window, the Bank Term Funding Program ( BTFP ) and the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation - Government Securities Division ( FICC GSD ) general collateral financing repurchase agreement service. For each of these programs, the ability to borrow utilizing these sources is dependent on meeting the respective membership requirements. Our borrowing capacity in each program is a function of the collateral the Bank has posted with each counterparty, including any respective haircuts applied to that collateral. As of September 30, 2023, we pledged both loans and securities to the FHLB to secure a maximum borrowing capacity of $31.6 billion, of which $50 million was used. Our FHLB membership is supported by our investment in FHLB stock of $18 million and $15 million as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. As a member of FICC GSD, we have $15.2 billion of readily available borrowing capacity secured by securities from our investment portfolio as of September 30, 2023. Our FICC GSD membership is supported by our investment in Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation ( DTCC ) common stock of $375 thousand as of both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. As of September 30, 2023, we pledged loans to secure a borrowing capacity of $40.9 billion under the Federal Reserve Discount Window. Additionally, we pledged securities to secure a borrowing capacity of $9.7 billion under the BTFP.

Business Supervision and Regulation in our 2022 Form 10-K for additional information. We provide additional information on the composition of deposits in 49 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis Funding Sources Composition and in Part I Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 7 Deposits and Borrowings. Funding Our primary source of funding comes from retail deposits, as they are a relatively stable and lower cost source of funding. In addition to deposits, we raise funding through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes and securitized debt obligations, federal funds purchased, securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase and FHLB advances secured by certain portions of our loan and securities portfolios. A key objective in our use of these markets is to maintain access to a diversified mix of wholesale funding sources. See Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis Funding Sources Composition for additional information on our primary sources of funding. In the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments that affect our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. Our future cash outflows primarily relate to deposits, borrowings and operating leases. The actual timing and amounts of future cash payments may vary over time due to a number of factors, such as early debt redemptions and changes in deposit balances. Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt We access the capital markets to meet our funding needs through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, securitized debt obligations and federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. In addition, we have access to short-term and long-term FHLB advances secured by certain investment securities, multifamily real estate loans and commercial real estate loans. Our short-term borrowings, which include those borrowings with an original contractual maturity of one year or less, typically consist of federal funds purchased, securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase or short-term FHLB advances, and do not include the current portion of long-term debt. Our short-term borrowings decreased by $361 million to $522 million as of September 30, 2023 from December 31, 2022 driven by a decrease in repurchase agreements. Our long-term funding, which primarily consists of securitized debt obligations and senior and subordinated notes, increased by $893 million to $48.7 billion as of September 30, 2023 from December 31, 2022 primarily driven by net issuances for senior unsecured debt and securitization programs .

Our other contractual obligations include lending commitments, leases, purchase obligations and other contractual arrangements. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, our total unfunded lending commitments were $439.2 billion and $409.3 billion, respectively, primarily consisting of credit card lines and loan commitments to customers of both our Commercial Banking and Consumer Banking businesses, as well as standby and commercial letters of credit. We generally manage the potential risk of unfunded lending commitments by limiting the total amount of arrangements, monitoring the size and maturity structure of these portfolios and applying the same credit standards for all of our credit activities. For additional information, refer to Part I Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 13 Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others in this Report. Our primary involvement with leases is in the capacity as a lessee where we lease premises to support our business. The majority of our leases are operating leases of office space, retail bank branches and caf s. Our operating leases expire at various dates through 2071, although some have extension or termination options. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, in aggregate operating lease obligations. We provide more information on our lease activity in Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 7 Premises, Equipment and Leases in our 2022 Form 10-K. We have purchase obligations that represent substantial agreements to purchase goods or receive services such as data management, media and other software and third-party services that are enforceable and legally binding and specify significant terms. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had $758 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, in aggregate purchase obligation liabilities. We also enter into various contractual arrangements that may require future cash payments, including short-term obligations such as trade payables, commitments to fund certain equity investments, obligations for pension and post-retirement benefit plans, and representation and warranty reserves.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 14 Employee Benefit Plans in our 2022 Form 10-K. MARKET RISK PROFILE Our primary market risk exposures include interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and commodity pricing risk. We are exposed to market risk primarily from the following operations and activities: Traditional banking activities of deposit gathering and lending; Asset/liability management activities including the management of investment securities, short-term and long-term borrowings and derivatives; Foreign operations in the U.K. and Canada within our Credit Card business; and Customer accommodation activities within our Commercial Banking business. We have enterprise-wide risk management policies and limits, approved by our Board of Directors, which govern our market risk management activities. Our objective is to manage our exposure to market risk in accordance with these policies and limits based on prevailing market conditions and long-term expectations. We provide additional information below about our primary sources of market risk, our market risk management strategies and the measures that we use to evaluate these exposures. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk represents exposure to financial instruments whose values vary with the level or volatility of interest rates. We are exposed to interest rate risk primarily from the differences in the timing between the maturities or repricing of assets and liabilities. Our balance sheet is structurally asset sensitive as our loans, which are primarily floating rate or fixed rate with short durations, reprice faster than our fixed rate debt and a portion of our deposits when interest rates change. We take actions to 52 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents reduce the interest rate risk from this structural balance sheet position primarily by investing in fixed rate securities in our investment portfolio and executing interest rate swaps and other derivative instruments. We use various industry standard market risk measurement techniques and analyses to measure, assess and manage the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and our economic value of equity and changes in foreign exchange rates on our non-dollar-denominated funding and non-dollar equity investments in foreign operations. Net Interest Income Sensitivity Our net interest income sensitivity measure estimates the impact on our projected 12-month baseline net interest income resulting from movements in interest rates. In addition to our existing assets and liabilities, we incorporate expected future business growth assumptions, such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, and plans for projected changes in our funding mix in our baseline forecast. We also incorporate the dynamic nature of deposit repricing, which includes pricing lags and changes in deposit beta and mix as interest rates change, and the prepayment sensitivity of our mortgage securities to the level of interest rates. In measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our projected net interest income, we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates detailed in Table 32 below. At the current level of interest rates, our net interest income is expected to increase in higher rate scenarios and decrease in lower rate scenarios. Our current sensitivity to both upward and downward shocks is largely unchanged as compared to December 31, 2022, as the increase in cash balances was offset by an increase in deposit beta, which was driven by higher interest rates and mix shift toward higher rate paid deposit products. Cash balances reprice relatively rapidly, whereas deposit rates reprice less with both lag and beta effects. In the contexts used in this section, beta refers to the percentage of deposit rate repricing relative to an external reference rate such as federal funds. In our models, deposit betas vary dynamically and by product type. Economic Value of Equity Sensitivity Our economic value of equity sensitivity measure estimates the impact on the net present value of our assets and liabilities, including derivative exposures, resulting from movements in interest rates. Our economic value of equity sensitivity measure is calculated based on our existing assets and liabilities, including derivatives, and does not incorporate business growth assumptions or projected balance sheet changes. Similar to our net interest income sensitivity measure, we incorporate the dynamic nature of deposit repricing and attrition, which includes pricing lags and changes in deposit beta as interest rates change and the prepayment sensitivity of our mortgage securities to the level of interest rates. Other key assumptions used in the calculation include attrition assumptions for loans and other assets, term structure modeling of interest rates and discount spreads. In measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our economic value of equity, we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates detailed in Table 32 below. Our current economic value of equity sensitivity profile demonstrates that our economic value of equity decreases in higher interest rate scenarios and increases in lower interest rate scenarios. The decrease in higher rate scenarios is due to the declines in the projected value of our fixed rate assets being only partially offset by corresponding movements in the projected value of our deposits and other liabilities. The pace of economic value of equity decrease is larger for the +200 bps scenario as our deposits are assumed to reprice more rapidly in higher interest rate environments. Our current economic value of equity sensitivity increased as compared to December 31, 2022, primarily due to an increase in deposit beta driven by higher interest rates and mix shift towards higher rate paid deposit products. 53 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 32 shows the estimated percentage impact on our projected baseline net interest income and our current economic value of equity calculated under the methodology described above as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. In instances where an interest rate scenario would result in a rate less than 0%, we assume a rate of 0% for that scenario. This assumption applies only to jurisdictions that do not have a practice of employing negative policy rates. In jurisdictions that have negative policy rates, we do not floor interest rates at 0%. Table 32: Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Estimated impact on projected baseline net interest income: +200 basis points 0.4 % 0.4 % +100 basis points 0.6 0.8 +50 basis points 0.4 0.4 50 basis points (0.5) (0.7) 100 basis points (1.0) (1.3) 200 basis points (1.9) (2.6) Estimated impact on economic value of equity: +200 basis points (6.8) (4.3) +100 basis points (2.9) (1.5) +50 basis points (1.4) (0.7) 50 basis points 1.4 0.4 100 basis points 2.6 0.6 200 basis points 4.2 (0.2) In addition to these industry standard measures, we consider the potential impact of alternative interest rate scenarios, such as stressed rate shocks as well as steepening and flattening yield curve scenarios in our internal interest rate risk management decisions. We also regularly review the sensitivity of our interest rate risk metrics to changes in our key modeling assumptions, such as our loan and deposit balance forecasts, mortgage prepayments and deposit repricing. Limitations of Market Risk Measures The interest rate risk models that we use in deriving these measures incorporate contractual information, internally-developed assumptions and proprietary modeling methodologies, which project borrower and depositor behavior patterns in certain interest rate environments. Other market inputs, such as interest rates, market prices and interest rate volatility, are also critical components of our interest rate risk measures. We regularly evaluate, update and enhance these assumptions, models and analytical tools as we believe appropriate to reflect our best assessment of the market environment and the expected behavior patterns of our existing assets and liabilities. There are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates. The sensitivity analysis described above contemplates only certain movements in interest rates and is performed at a particular point in time based on our existing balance sheet and, in some cases, expected future business growth and funding mix assumptions. The strategic actions that management may take to manage our balance sheet may differ significantly from our projections, which could cause our actual earnings and economic value of equity sensitivities to differ substantially from the above sensitivity analysis. For further information on our interest rate exposures, see Part I Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 8 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. 54 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Foreign Exchange Risk Foreign exchange risk represents exposure to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in other currencies. We are exposed to foreign exchange risk primarily from the intercompany funding denominated in pound sterling ( GBP ) and the Canadian dollar ( CAD ) that we provide to our businesses in the U.K. and Canada and net equity investments in those businesses. We are also exposed to foreign exchange risk due to changes in the dollar-denominated value of future earnings and cash flows from our foreign operations and from our Euro ( EUR )-denominated borrowings. Our non-dollar denominated intercompany funding and EUR-denominated borrowings expose our earnings to foreign exchange transaction risk. We manage these transaction risks by using forward foreign currency derivatives and cross-currency swaps to hedge our exposures. We measure our foreign exchange transaction risk exposures by applying a 1% U.S. dollar appreciation shock against the value of the non-dollar denominated intercompany funding and EUR-denominated borrowings and their related hedges, which shows the impact to our earnings from foreign exchange risk. Our nominal intercompany funding outstanding was 902 million GBP and 785 million GBP as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, and 1.7 billion CAD as of both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Our nominal EUR-denominated borrowings outstanding were 1.3 billion EUR as of both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Our non-dollar equity investments in foreign operations expose our balance sheet to translation risk in AOCI and our capital ratios. We manage our AOCI exposure by entering into foreign currency derivatives designated as net investment hedges. We measure these exposures by applying a 30% U.S. dollar appreciation shock, which we believe approximates a significant adverse shock over a one-year time horizon, against the value of the equity invested in our foreign operations net of related net investment hedges where applicable. Our gross equity exposures in our U.K. and Canadian operations were 2.2 billion GBP and 1.9 billion GBP as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, and 2.4 billion CAD and 2.2 billion CAD as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. As a result of our derivative management activities, we believe our net exposure to foreign exchange risk is minimal. Risk related to Customer Accommodation Derivatives We offer interest rate, commodity and foreign currency derivatives as an accommodation to our customers within our Commercial Banking business. We offset the majority of the market risk of these customer accommodation derivatives by entering into offsetting derivatives transactions with other counterparties. We use value-at-risk ( VaR ) as the primary method to measure the market risk in our customer accommodation derivative activities on a daily basis. VaR is a statistical risk measure used to estimate the potential loss from movements observed in the recent market environment. We employ a historical simulation approach using the most recent 500 business days and use a 99 percent confidence level and a holding period of one business day. As a result of offsetting our customer exposures with other counterparties, we believe that our net exposure to market risk in our customer accommodation derivatives is minimal. For further information on our risk related to customer accommodation derivatives, see Part I Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 8 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SUPERVISION AND REGULATION Basel III and U.S. Capital Rules Update Basel III Finalization Proposal On July 27, 2023, the Federal Banking Agencies released a notice of proposed rulemaking (the Basel III Finalization Proposal ) to revise the Basel III Capital Rules applicable to banking organizations with total assets of $100 billion or more and their subsidiary depository institutions, including the Company and the Bank, respectively. The Basel III Finalization Proposal would introduce a new framework for calculating risk-weighted assets (the Expanded Risk-Based Approach ). The proposal would also replace the existing approach for market risk with a new approach based on both internal models and standardized methodologies. An institution subject to the proposal would be required to calculate its risk-weighted assets under both the Expanded Risk-Based Approach and the existing Basel III standardized approach and, for each risk-based capital ratio, would be bound by the calculation that produces the lower ratio. All capital buffer requirements, including the stress capital buffer requirement, would apply regardless of whether the Expanded Risk-Based Approach or the existing Basel III standardized approach produces the lower ratio. 55 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents The Basel III Finalization Proposal would also make certain changes to the calculation of regulatory capital for Category III and IV institutions. Under the proposal, these institutions would be required to begin recognizing certain elements of AOCI in CET1 capital, including unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities. The proposal would also generally reduce the threshold above which these institutions must deduct certain assets from their CET1 capital, including certain deferred tax assets, mortgage servicing assets and investments in unconsolidated financial institutions. The Basel III Finalization Proposal includes a proposed effective date of July 1, 2025, subject to a three-year transition period ending July 1, 2028, over which risk-weighted assets calculated under the Expanded Risk-Based Approach and the recognition of AOCI in CET1 capital would be phased in. Enhanced Prudential Standards and Other Related Requirements Update Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Requirements On August 29, 2023, the Federal Banking Agencies proposed a rule that would require banking organizations with $100 billion or more in total assets, including the Company, to comply with certain long-term debt requirements and clean holding company requirements (the LTD Proposal ). If adopted as proposed, the LTD Proposal would require the Company and the Bank to each maintain a minimum outstanding eligible long-term debt amount of no less than the greatest of (i) 6% of total risk-weighted assets, (ii) 2.5% of total leverage exposure and (iii) 3.5% of average total consolidated assets. To qualify as eligible long-term debt, a debt instrument would be required to meet the requirements currently applicable under the rules that apply to U.S. G-SIBs, as well as certain additional requirements. Additionally, the clean holding company requirements included in the LTD Proposal would limit or prohibit the Company from entering into certain transactions that could impede its orderly resolution. We are in the process of evaluating the LTD Proposal and assessing its potential impact on Capital One, if adopted as proposed. We provide additional information on our Supervision and Regulation in our 2022 Form 10-K under Part I Item 1.

Capital One Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company or Capital One ) offer a broad array of financial products and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients through digital channels, branch locations, caf and other distribution channels. As of September 30, 2023, Capital One Financial Corporation principal subsidiary was Capital One, National Association ( CONA ). On October 1, 2022, the Company completed the merger of Capital One Bank (USA), National Association ( COBNA ), with and into CONA, with CONA as the surviving entity (the Bank Merger ). The Company is hereafter collectively referred to as we, us or our. References to the Bank shall mean and refer to (i) CONA from and after the Bank Merger and (ii) CONA and COBNA collectively prior to the Bank Merger. We also offer products outside of the United States of America ( U.S. ) principally through Capital One (Europe) plc ( COEP ), an indirect subsidiary of CONA organized and located in the United Kingdom ( U.K. ), and through a branch of CONA in Canada. Both COEP and our Canadian branch of CONA have the authority to provide credit card loans. Our principal operations are organized for management reporting purposes into three major business segments, which are defined primarily based on the products and services provided or the types of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. We provide details on our business segments, the integration of recent acquisitions, if any, into our business segments and the allocation methodologies and accounting policies used to derive our business segment results in Note 12 Business Segments and Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Basis of Presentation and Use of Estimates The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ( U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and in the related disclosures. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. While management makes its best judgments, actual amounts or results could differ from these estimates. In the opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments have been included for a fair statement of this interim financial information. These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements, and related notes thereto, included in Capital One Financial Corporation 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K ( 2022 Form 10-K ). Loan Modifications and Restructurings We adopted ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures on January 1, 2023, and elected the modified retrospective adoption method. The ASU eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings ( TDRs ) and resulted in a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings and our allowance, which was not considered material. Subsequent to adoption, our consideration of modifications in measurement of the allowance for credit losses remains substantively unchanged. The ASU also establishes prospective disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty and current-period gross charge-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases. We provide information on modified loans, including the performance of those loans subsequent to modification in Note 3 Loans and gross charge-offs by year of origination in Note 4 Allowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments. 75 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents As part of our loss mitigation efforts, we may provide modifications to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty to improve long-term collectability of the loan and to avoid the need for foreclosure or repossession of collateral, if any. Loan modifications to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty in the form of principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, an other-than-insignificant delay in payment, including payment deferrals, a term extension, or a combination of these modifications are reported as a financial difficulty modification ( FDM ). As restructurings offered to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty are typically not at market terms, FDMs are generally accounted for as a continuation of the existing loan. See Note 3 Loans for additional information on our loan modifications and restructurings. Loan Modifications and Restructurings Prior to Adoption of ASU 2022-02 In periods prior to 2023, a loan modification in which a concession is granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty was accounted for and reported as a TDR. These loan modifications typically include short-term payment deferrals, an extension of the loan term, a reduction in the interest rate, a reduction in the loan balance, or a combination of these modifications. See Note 3 Loans for additional information on our loan modifications and restructurings. Modified loans and troubled debt restructurings: Modified loans, including TDRs for periods ending on or before December 31, 2022 and FDMs for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, that are current at the time of the restructuring remain in accrual status if there is demonstrated performance prior to the restructuring and continued performance under the modified terms is expected. Otherwise, the modified loan is classified as nonperforming. For additional information, see Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our 2022 Form 10-K. Newly Adopted Accounting Standards During the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Standard Guidance Adoption Timing and Financial Statement Impacts Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty and Vintage Disclosures ASU No. 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures Issued March 2022 Eliminates accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings by creditors, and enhances disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty; Requires an entity to disclose current-period gross writeoffs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2023 using a modified retrospective adoption method, which results in a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings in the period of adoption and prospective application of the enhanced disclosure requirements. Our adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 3 Loans and Note 4 Allowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments for additional disclosures. 76 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents NOTE 2 INVESTMENT SECURITIES Our investment securities portfolio consists of the following: U.S. government-sponsored enterprise or agency ( Agency ) and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities ( RMBS ), agency commercial mortgage-backed securities ( CMBS ), U.S. Treasury securities and other securities.

We discuss these risks and our credit quality indicator for each portfolio segment below. Credit Card Our credit card loan portfolio is highly diversified across millions of accounts and numerous geographies without significant individual exposure. We therefore generally manage credit risk based on portfolios with common risk characteristics. The risk in our credit card loan portfolio correlates to broad economic trends, such as unemployment rates and the U.S. Real Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) Rate, as well as consumers financial condition, all of which can have a material effect on credit performance. The key indicator we assess in monitoring the credit quality and risk of our credit card loan portfolio is delinquency trends, including an analysis of loan migration between delinquency categories over time. The table below presents our credit card portfolio by delinquency status as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Table 3.3: Credit Card Delinquency Status September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 (Dollars in millions) Revolving Loans Revolving Loans Converted to Term Total Revolving Loans Revolving Loans Converted to Term Total Credit Card: Domestic credit card: Current $ 133,953 $ 314 $ 134,267 $ 126,811 $ 255 $ 127,066 30-59 days 1,796 24 1,820 1,388 17 1,405 60-89 days 1,312 17 1,329 964 11 975 Greater than 90 days 2,879 25 2,904 2,121 14 2,135 Total domestic credit card 139,940 380 140,320 131,284 297 131,581 International card businesses: Current 6,140 30 6,170 5,866 29 5,895 30-59 days 101 4 105 83 3 86 60-89 days 64 3 67 55 3 58 Greater than 90 days 117 4 121 106 4 110 Total international card businesses 6,422 41 6,463 6,110 39 6,149 Total credit card $ 146,362 $ 421 $ 146,783 $ 137,394 $ 336 $ 137,730 Consumer Banking Our consumer banking loan portfolio consists of auto and retail banking loans. Similar to our credit card loan portfolio, the risk in our consumer banking loan portfolio correlates to broad economic trends as well as consumers financial condition, all of which can have a material effect on credit performance. The key indicator we consider when assessing the credit quality and risk of our auto loan portfolio is borrower credit scores as they measure the creditworthiness of borrowers. Delinquency trends are the key indicator we assess in monitoring the credit quality and risk of our retail banking loan portfolio. The table below presents our consumer banking portfolio of loans held for investment by credit quality indicator as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

Balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 620 or below category. 83 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Commercial Banking The key credit quality indicator for our commercial loan portfolios is our internal risk ratings. We assign internal risk ratings to loans based on relevant information about the ability of the borrowers to repay their debt. In determining the risk rating of a particular loan, some of the factors considered are the borrower current financial condition, historical and projected future credit performance, prospects for support from financially responsible guarantors, the estimated realizable value of any collateral and current economic trends. The scale based on our internal risk rating system is as follows: Noncriticized: Loans that have not been designated as criticized, frequently referred to as pass loans. Criticized performing: Loans in which the financial condition of the obligor is stressed, affecting earnings, cash flows or collateral values. The borrower currently has adequate capacity to meet near-term obligations; however, the stress, left unabated, may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects at some future date. Criticized nonperforming: Loans that are not adequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or the collateral pledged, if any. Loans classified as criticized nonperforming have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses, which jeopardize the full repayment of the debt. These loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain a credit loss if the deficiencies are not corrected and are generally placed on nonaccrual status. We use our internal risk rating system for regulatory reporting, determining the frequency of credit exposure reviews, and evaluating and determining the allowance for credit losses. Generally, loans that are designated as criticized performing and criticized nonperforming are reviewed quarterly by management to determine if they are appropriately classified/rated and whether any impairment exists. Noncriticized loans are also generally reviewed, at least annually, to determine the appropriate risk rating. In addition, we evaluate the risk rating during the renewal process of any loan or if a loan becomes past due. The following table presents our commercial banking portfolio of loans held for investment by internal risk ratings as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The internal risk rating status includes all past due loans, both performing and nonperforming. Certain amounts as of December 31, 2022 have been reclassified between vintage years to reflect our revised methodology for loans impacted by LIBOR transition.

We consider the impact of all loan modifications when estimating the credit quality of our loan portfolio and establishing allowance levels. For our Commercial Banking customers, loan modifications are also considered in the assignment of an internal risk rating. On January 1, 2023, we adopted ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures using the modified retrospective adoption method. The ASU eliminates the accounting guidance for TDRs and enhances disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty ( FDMs ). The types of modifications we offer borrowers experiencing financial difficulty did not change as a result of ASU 2022-02. Under this new accounting guidance, FDMs are accumulated and the performance of each loan that received a FDM is reported on a rolling twelve month basis. For the interim reporting period ended September 30, 2023, FDMs and the related borrower performance information pertain to FDMs which occurred in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. For additional information on FDMs, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. For the interim periods prior to adoption of ASU 2022-02, our previous TDR disclosures are included below in the Troubled Debt Restructurings section. For additional information on loan modifications classified as a TDR prior to January 1, 2023, see Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our 2022 Form 10-K. FDM disclosures are not directly comparable to the prior period TDR disclosures due to differences in the respective accounting guidance and disclosure requirements. 86 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents The following table presents the major modification types, amortized cost amounts for each modification type and financial effects for all FDMs undertaken during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, we converted $ 51 million and $ 383 million of revolving loans to term loans, respectively, primarily in our domestic credit card and commercial banking loan portfolios . 91 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents NOTE 4 ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND RESERVE FOR UNFUNDED LENDING COMMITMENTS Our allowance for credit losses represents management current estimate of expected credit losses over the contractual terms of our loans held for investment as of each balance sheet date. Expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off or expected to be charged off are recognized within the allowance. Significant judgment is applied in our estimation of lifetime credit losses. When developing an estimate of expected credit losses, we use both quantitative and qualitative methods in considering all available information relevant to assessing collectability. This may include internal information, external information or a combination of both relating to past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Our estimate of expected credit losses includes a reasonable and supportable forecast period of one year and then reverts over a one-year period to historical losses at each relevant loss component of the estimate. Management will consider and may qualitatively adjust for conditions, changes and trends in loan portfolios that may not be captured in modeled results. These adjustments are referred to as qualitative factors and represent management judgment of the imprecision and risks inherent in the processes and assumptions used in establishing the allowance for credit losses. We have unfunded lending commitments in our Commercial Banking business that are not unconditionally cancellable by us and for which we estimate expected credit losses in establishing a reserve. This reserve is measured using the same measurement objectives as the allowance for loans held for investment. We build or release the reserve for unfunded lending commitments through the provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of income, and the related reserve for unfunded lending commitments is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. See Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our 2022 Form 10-K for further discussion of the methodology and policy for determining our allowance for credit losses for each of our loan portfolio segments, as well as information on our reserve for unfunded lending commitments.

(2) Primarily represents the initial allowance for purchased credit-deteriorated ( PCD ) loans and foreign currency translation adjustments. The initial allowance of purchased credit-deteriorated loans was $ 0 million and $ 32 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, and $ 10 million for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. (3) Impact from the adoption of ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures as of January 1, 2023. On January 1, 2023, we adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures using the modified retrospective approach, which consists of implementing disclosure requirements prospectively as of the adoption date. The ASU requires public entities to disclose current-period gross charge-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases. We charge off loans when we determine that the loan is uncollectible. The amortized cost basis, excluding accrued interest, is charged off as a reduction to the allowance for credit losses in accordance with our accounting policies. For more information, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off or expected to be charged off are recognized within the allowance, with a corresponding reduction to our provision for credit losses. 94 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents The table below presents gross charge-offs for loans held for investment by vintage year during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

The expected reimbursements from these partners are netted against our allowance for credit losses. Our methodology for estimating reimbursements is consistent with the methodology we use to estimate the allowance for credit losses on our credit card loan receivables. These expected reimbursements result in reductions in net charge-offs and the provision for credit losses. See Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our 2022 Form 10-K for further discussion of our credit card partnership agreements. The table below summarizes the changes in the estimated reimbursements from these partners for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022.

Our primary involvement with VIEs is related to our securitization transactions in which we transfer assets to securitization trusts. We primarily securitize credit card and auto loans, which provide a source of funding for us and enable us to transfer a certain portion of the economic risk of the loans or related debt securities to third parties. The entity that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is referred to as the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the VIE. The majority of the VIEs in which we are involved have been consolidated in our financial statements. Summary of Consolidated and Unconsolidated VIEs The assets of our consolidated VIEs primarily consist of cash, loan receivables and the related allowance for credit losses, which we report on our consolidated balance sheets under restricted cash for securitization investors, loans held in consolidated trusts and allowance for credit losses, respectively. The assets of a particular VIE are the primary source of funds to settle its obligations. Creditors of these VIEs typically do not have recourse to our general credit. Liabilities primarily consist of debt securities issued by the VIEs, which we report under securitized debt obligations on our consolidated balance sheets. For unconsolidated VIEs, we present the carrying amount of assets and liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheets and our maximum exposure to loss. Our maximum exposure to loss is estimated based on the unlikely event that all of the assets in the VIEs become worthless and we are required to meet the maximum amount of any remaining funding obligations. The tables below present a summary of VIEs in which we had continuing involvement or held a significant variable interest, aggregated based on VIEs with similar characteristics as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. We separately present information for consolidated and unconsolidated VIEs.

(2) Represents the carrying amount of assets and liabilities of the VIE, which includes the seller interest and repurchased notes held by other related parties. (3) In certain investment structures, we consolidate a VIE which in turn holds as its primary asset an investment in an unconsolidated VIE. In these instances, we disclose the carrying amount of assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as unconsolidated VIEs to avoid duplicating our exposure, as the unconsolidated VIEs are generally the operating entities generating the exposure. The carrying amount of assets and liabilities included in the unconsolidated VIE columns above related to these investment structures were $ 2.5 billion of assets and $ 931 million of liabilities as of September 30, 2023, and $ 2.3 billion of assets and $ 616 million of liabilities as of December 31, 2022. (4) Primarily consists of variable interests in companies that promote renewable energy sources and other equity method investments. Securitization-Related VIEs In a securitization transaction, assets are transferred to a trust, which generally meets the definition of a VIE. We engage in securitization activities as an issuer and an investor. Our primary securitization issuance activity includes credit card and auto securitizations, conducted through securitization trusts which we consolidate. Our continuing involvement in these securitization transactions mainly consists of acting as the primary servicer and holding certain retained interests. In our multifamily agency business, we originate multifamily commercial real estate loans and transfer them to government-sponsored enterprises ( GSEs ) who may, in turn, securitize them. We retain the related mortgage servicing rights ( MSRs ) and service the transferred loans pursuant to the guidelines set forth by the GSEs. As an investor, we hold primarily RMBS, CMBS, and ABS in our investment securities portfolio, which represent variable interests in the respective securitization trusts from which those securities were issued. We do not consolidate the securitization trusts employed in these transactions as we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these securitization trusts. We exclude these VIEs from the tables within this note because we do not consider our continuing involvement with these VIEs to be significant as we either solely invest in securities issued by the VIE and were not involved in the design of the VIE or no transfers have occurred between the VIE and ourselves. Our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with these VIEs is the carrying value of the MSRs and investment securities on our consolidated balance sheets as well as our contractual obligations under loss sharing arrangements. See Note 13 Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others for information about the loss sharing agreements, Note 6 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for information related to our MSRs associated with these securitizations and Note 2 Investment Securities for more information on the securities held in our investment securities portfolio. In addition, where we have certain lending arrangements in the normal course of business with entities that could be VIEs, we have also excluded these VIEs from the tables presented in this note. See Note 3 Loans for additional information regarding our lending arrangements in the normal course of business. 98 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents The table below presents our continuing involvement in certain securitization-related VIEs as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Table 5.2: Continuing Involvement in Securitization-Related VIEs (Dollars in millions) Credit Card Auto September 30, 2023: Securities held by third-party investors $ 13,772 $ 3,645 Receivables in the trusts 25,532 4,295 Cash balance of spread or reserve accounts 0 20 Retained interests Yes Yes Servicing retained Yes Yes December 31, 2022: Securities held by third-party investors $ 12,976 $ 3,997 Receivables in the trusts 24,367 4,682 Cash balance of spread or reserve accounts 0 23 Retained interests Yes Yes Servicing retained Yes Yes Credit Card Securitizations We securitize a portion of our credit card loans which provides a source of funding for us. Credit card securitizations involve the transfer of credit card receivables to securitization trusts. These trusts then issue debt securities collateralized by the transferred receivables to third-party investors. We hold certain retained interests in our credit card securitizations and continue to service the receivables in these trusts. We consolidate these trusts because we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary as we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts, and the right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the trusts. Auto Securitizations Similar to our credit card securitizations, we securitize a portion of our auto loans which provides a source of funding for us. Auto securitizations involve the transfer of auto loans to securitization trusts. These trusts then issue debt securities collateralized by the transferred loans to third-party investors. We hold certain retained interests and continue to service the loans in these trusts. We consolidate these trusts because we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary as we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts, and the right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the trusts. Other VIEs Affordable Housing Entities As part of our community reinvestment initiatives, we invest in private investment funds that make equity investments in multifamily affordable housing properties. We receive affordable housing tax credits for these investments. The activities of these entities are financed with a combination of invested equity capital and debt. We account for certain investments in qualified affordable housing projects using the proportional amortization method if certain criteria are met. The proportional amortization method amortizes the cost of the investment over the period in which the investor expects to receive tax credits and other tax benefits, and the resulting amortization is recognized as a component of income tax expense attributable to continuing operations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, we recognized amortization of $ 522 million and $ 484 million, respectively, and tax credits of $ 652 million and $ 582 million, respectively, associated with these investments within income tax provision. The carrying value of our equity investments in these qualified affordable housing projects was $ 5.3 billion and $ 4.9 billion as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. We are periodically required to provide additional financial or other support during the period of the investments. Our liability for these unfunded 99 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents commitments was $ 2.2 billion and $ 1.8 billion as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 respectively, and is largely expected to be paid from 2023 to 2026. For those investment funds considered to be VIEs, we are not required to consolidate them if we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of those entities. We record our interests in these unconsolidated VIEs in loans held for investment, other assets and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Our maximum exposure to these entities is limited to our variable interests in the entities which consisted of assets of approximately $ 5.6 billion and $ 4.9 billion as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The creditors of the VIEs have no recourse to our general credit and we do not provide additional financial or other support other than during the period that we are contractually required to provide it. The total assets of the unconsolidated VIE investment funds were approximately $ 12.6 billion and $ 12.5 billion as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Entities that Provide Capital to Low-Income and Rural Communities We hold variable interests in entities ( Investor Entities ) that invest in community development entities ( CDEs ) that provide debt financing to businesses and non-profit entities in low-income and rural communities. Variable interests in the CDEs held by the consolidated Investor Entities are also our variable interests. The activities of the Investor Entities are financed with a combination of invested equity capital and debt. The activities of the CDEs are financed solely with invested equity capital. We receive federal and state tax credits for these investments. We consolidate the VIEs in which we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE economic performance and where we have the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to the VIE. We consolidate other investments and CDEs that are not considered to be VIEs, but where we hold a controlling financial interest. The assets of the VIEs that we consolidated, which totaled approximately $ 2.5 billion and $ 2.3 billion as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets in cash, loans held for investment, and other assets. The liabilities are reflected in other liabilities. The creditors of the VIEs have no recourse to our general credit. We have not provided additional financial or other support other than during the period that we are contractually required to provide it. Other We hold variable interests in other VIEs, including companies that promote renewable energy sources and other equity method investments. We are not required to consolidate these VIEs because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact their economic performance. Our maximum exposure to these VIEs is limited to the investments on our consolidated balance sheets of $ 466 million and $ 337 million as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The creditors of the other VIEs have no recourse to our general credit. We have not provided additional financial or other support other than during the period that we are contractually required to provide it. 100 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents NOTE 6 GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS The table below presents our goodwill, other intangible assets and MSRs as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

We also use a variety of other funding sources including short-term borrowings, senior and subordinated notes, securitized debt obligations and other borrowings. Securitized debt obligations are presented separately on our consolidated balance sheets, as they represent obligations of consolidated securitization trusts, while federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, senior and subordinated notes and other borrowings, including FHLB advances, are included in other debt on our consolidated balance sheets. Our total short-term borrowings generally consist of federal funds purchased, securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase and FHLB advances. Our long-term debt consists of borrowings with an original contractual maturity of greater than one year. The following tables summarize the components of our deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

Our primary market risks stem from the impact on our earnings and economic value of equity due to changes in interest rates and, to a lesser extent, changes in foreign exchange rates. We manage our interest rate sensitivity by employing several techniques, which include changing the duration and re-pricing characteristics of various assets and liabilities by using interest rate derivatives. We also use foreign currency derivatives to limit our earnings and capital exposures to foreign exchange risk by hedging exposures denominated in foreign currencies. We primarily use interest rate and foreign currency swaps to hedge, but we may also use a variety of other derivative instruments, including caps, floors, options, futures and forward contracts, to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risks. We designate these risk management derivatives as either qualifying accounting hedges or free-standing derivatives. Qualifying accounting hedges are further designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges. Free-standing derivatives are economic hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting. We also offer interest rate, commodity, foreign currency derivatives and other contracts as an accommodation to our customers within our Commercial Banking business. We enter into these derivatives with our customers primarily to help them manage their interest rate risks, hedge their energy and other commodities exposures, and manage foreign currency fluctuations. We offset the substantial majority of the market risk exposure of our customer accommodation derivatives through derivative transactions with other counterparties. See below for additional information on our use of derivatives and how we account for them: Fair Value Hedges: We designate derivatives as fair value hedges when they are used to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities, which fluctuate in value as a result of movements in interest rates. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are presented in the same line item in our consolidated statements of income as the earnings effect of the hedged items. Our fair value hedges primarily consist of interest rate swaps that are intended to modify our exposure to interest rate risk on various fixed-rate financial assets and liabilities. Cash Flow Hedges: We designate derivatives as cash flow hedges when they are used to manage our exposure to variability in cash flows related to forecasted transactions. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ). Those amounts are reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged forecasted transactions impact earnings and presented in the same line item in our consolidated statements of income as the earnings effect of the hedged items. Our cash flow hedges use interest rate swaps and floors that are intended to hedge the variability in interest receipts or interest payments on some of our variable-rate financial assets or liabilities. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our exposure to variability in cash flows related to intercompany borrowings denominated in foreign currencies. Net Investment Hedges: We use net investment hedges to manage the foreign currency exposure related to our net investments in foreign operations that have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in the fair value of net investment hedges are recorded in the translation adjustment component of AOCI, offsetting the translation gain or loss from those foreign operations. We execute net investment hedges using foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the translation exposure of the net investment in our foreign operations under the forward method. Free-Standing Derivatives: Our free-standing derivatives primarily consist of our customer accommodation derivatives and other economic hedges. The customer accommodation derivatives and the related offsetting contracts are mainly interest rate, commodity and foreign currency contracts. The other free-standing derivatives are primarily used to economically hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of our commercial mortgage loan origination and purchase commitments as well as other interests held. Changes in the fair value of free-standing derivatives are recorded in earnings as a component of other non-interest income. 103 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Derivatives Counterparty Credit Risk Counterparty Types Derivative instruments contain an element of credit risk that stems from the potential failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of the contract, including making payments due upon maturity of certain derivative instruments. We execute our derivative contracts primarily in over-the-counter ( OTC ) markets. We also execute interest rate and commodity futures in the exchange-traded derivative markets. Our OTC derivatives consist of both trades cleared through central counterparty clearinghouses ( CCPs ) and uncleared bilateral contracts. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange ( CME ), the Intercontinental Exchange ( ICE ) and the LCH Group ( LCH ) are our CCPs for our centrally cleared contracts. In our uncleared bilateral contracts, we enter into agreements directly with our derivative counterparties. Counterparty Credit Risk Management We manage the counterparty credit risk associated with derivative instruments by entering into legally enforceable master netting agreements, where applicable, and exchanging collateral with our counterparties, typically in the form of cash or high-quality liquid securities. We exchange collateral in two primary forms: variation margin, which mitigates the risk of changes in value due to daily market movements and is exchanged daily, and initial margin, which mitigates the risk of potential future exposure of a derivative and is exchanged at the outset of a transaction and adjusted daily. We exchange variation margin and initial margin on our cleared derivatives. For uncleared bilateral derivatives executed after September 1, 2021 and in scope for initial margin, we exchange variation margin and initial margin. The amount of collateral exchanged for variation margin is dependent upon the fair value of the derivative instruments as well as the fair value of the pledged collateral and will vary over time as market variables change. The amount of the initial margin exchanged is dependent upon 1) the calculation of initial margin exposure, as prescribed by 1(a) the U.S. prudential regulators margin rules for uncleared derivatives ( PR Rules ) or 1(b) the CCPs for cleared derivatives and 2) the fair value of the pledged collateral; it will vary over time as market variables change. When valuing collateral, an estimate of the variation in price and liquidity over time is subtracted in the form of a haircut to discount the value of the collateral pledged. Our exposure to derivative counterparty credit risk, at any point in time, is equal to the amount reported as a derivative asset on our balance sheet. The fair value of our derivatives is adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and any associated collateral received or pledged. See Table 8.3 for our net exposure associated with derivatives. The terms under which we collateralize our exposures differ between cleared exposures and uncleared bilateral exposures. CCPs : We clear eligible OTC derivatives with CCPs as part of our regulatory requirements. We also clear exchange-traded instruments, like futures, with CCPs. Futures commission merchants ( FCMs ) serve as the intermediary between CCPs and us. CCPs require that we post initial and variation margin through our FCMs to mitigate the risk of non-payment or default. Initial margin is required by CCPs as collateral against potential losses on our exchange-traded and cleared derivative contracts and variation margin is exchanged on a daily basis to account for mark-to-market changes in those derivative contracts. For CME, ICE and LCH-cleared OTC derivatives, variation margin cash payments are required to be characterized as settlements. Our FCM agreements governing these derivative transactions include provisions that may require us to post additional collateral under certain circumstances. Bilateral Counterparties : We enter into master netting agreements and collateral agreements with bilateral derivative counterparties, where applicable, to mitigate the risk of default. These bilateral agreements typically provide the right to offset exposure with the same counterparty and require the party in a net liability position to post collateral. Agreements with certain bilateral counterparties require both parties to maintain collateral in the event the fair values of uncleared derivatives exceed established exposure thresholds. Certain of these bilateral agreements include provisions requiring that our debt maintain a credit rating of investment grade or above by each of the major credit rating agencies. In the event of a downgrade of our debt credit rating below investment grade, some of our counterparties would have the right to terminate their derivative contract and close out existing positions. 104 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Credit Risk Valuation Adjustments We record counterparty credit valuation adjustments ( CVAs ) on our derivative assets to reflect the credit quality of our counterparties. We consider collateral and legally enforceable master netting agreements that mitigate our credit exposure to each counterparty in determining CVAs, which may be adjusted due to changes in the fair values of the derivative contracts, collateral, and creditworthiness of the counterparty. We also record debit valuation adjustments ( DVAs ) to adjust the fair values of our derivative liabilities to reflect the impact of our own credit quality. Balance Sheet Presentation The following table summarizes the notional amounts and fair values of our derivative instruments as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, which are segregated by derivatives that are designated as accounting hedges and those that are not, and are further segregated by type of contract within those two categories. The total derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and any associated cash collateral received or pledged. Derivative assets and liabilities are included in other assets and other liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets, and their related gains or losses are included in operating activities as changes in other assets and other liabilities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

(2) Carrying value represents amortized cost. Balance Sheet Offsetting of Financial Assets and Liabilities Derivative contracts and repurchase agreements that we execute bilaterally in the OTC market are generally governed by enforceable master netting agreements where we generally have the right to offset exposure with the same counterparty. Either counterparty can generally request to net settle all contracts through a single payment upon default on, or termination of, any one contract. We elect to offset the derivative assets and liabilities under master netting agreements for balance sheet presentation where a right of setoff exists. For derivative contracts entered into under master netting agreements for which we have not been able to confirm the enforceability of the setoff rights, or those not subject to master netting agreements, we do not offset our derivative positions for balance sheet presentation. The following table presents the gross and net fair values of our derivative assets, derivative liabilities, resale and repurchase agreements and the related offsetting amounts permitted under U.S. GAAP as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The table also includes cash and non-cash collateral received or pledged in accordance with such arrangements. The amount of collateral presented, however, is limited to the amount of the related net derivative fair values or outstanding balances; therefore, instances of over-collateralization are excluded. 106 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 8.3: Offsetting of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Gross Amounts Gross Amounts Offset in the Balance Sheet Net Amounts as Recognized Securities Collateral Held Under Master Netting Agreements Net Exposure (Dollars in millions) Financial Instruments Cash Collateral Received As of September 30, 2023 Derivative assets (1) $ 3,381 $ ( 388 ) $ ( 1,083 ) $ 1,910 $ ( 77 ) $ 1,833 As of December 31, 2022 Derivative assets (1) 3,098 ( 759 ) ( 375 ) 1,964 ( 96 ) 1,868 Gross Amounts Gross Amounts Offset in the Balance Sheet Net Amounts as Recognized Securities Collateral Pledged Under Master Netting Agreements Net Exposure (Dollars in millions) Financial Instruments Cash Collateral Pledged As of September 30, 2023 Derivative liabilities (1) $ 3,699 $ ( 388 ) $ ( 244 ) $ 3,067 $ ( 79 ) $ 2,988 Repurchase agreements (2) 522 0 0 522 ( 522 ) 0 As of December 31, 2022 Derivative liabilities (1) 4,550 ( 759 ) ( 476 ) 3,315 ( 85 ) 3,230 Repurchase agreements (2) 883 0 0 883 ( 883 ) 0 __________ (1) We received cash collateral from derivative counterparties totaling $ 1.6 billion and $ 608 million as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.

(4) We recognized a gain of $ 100 million and $ 70 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, and a gain of $ 79 million and $ 98 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, on foreign exchange contracts reclassified from AOCI. These amounts were largely offset by the foreign currency transaction gains (losses) on our foreign currency denominated intercompany funding included in other non-interest income on our consolidated statements of income. In the next 12 months, we expect to reclassify into earnings an after-tax loss of $ 877 million recorded in AOCI as of September 30, 2023 associated with cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions. This amount will largely offset the cash flows associated with the forecasted transactions hedged by these derivatives. The maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions were hedged was approximately 9.5 years as of September 30, 2023. The amount we expect to reclassify into earnings may change as a result of changes in market conditions and ongoing actions taken as part of our overall risk management strategy. 110 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Free-Standing Derivatives The net impacts to our consolidated statements of income related to free-standing derivatives are presented below for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022.

The fair value accounting guidance provides a three-level fair value hierarchy for classifying financial instruments. This hierarchy is based on the markets in which the assets or liabilities trade and whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable. The fair value measurement of a financial asset or liability is assigned a level based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: Level 1: Valuation is based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Valuation is based on observable market-based inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3: Valuation is generated from techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. Valuation techniques include pricing models, discounted cash flow ( DCF ) methodologies or similar techniques. The accounting guidance for fair value measurements requires that we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in determining fair value. We consider all available information, including observable market data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs. Based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category, judgments are made regarding the significance of the observable or unobservable inputs to the instruments fair value measurement in its entirety. If unobservable inputs are considered significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3. The process for determining fair value using unobservable inputs is generally more subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and assumptions. The accounting guidance provides for the irrevocable option to elect, on a contract-by-contract basis, to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value at inception of the contract and record any subsequent changes in fair value in earnings. The determination and classification of financial instruments in the fair value hierarchy is performed at the end of each reporting period. We consider all available information, including observable market data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs. For additional information on the valuation techniques used in estimating the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities on a recurring basis, see Part II Item 8.

Level 3 Recurring Fair Value Rollforward The table below presents a reconciliation for all assets and liabilities measured and recognized at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. Generally, transfers into Level 3 were primarily driven by the usage of unobservable assumptions in the pricing of these financial instruments as evidenced by wider pricing variations among pricing vendors and transfers out of Level 3 were primarily driven by the usage of assumptions corroborated by market observable information as evidenced by tighter pricing among multiple pricing sources.

(4) Transfers into Level 3 primarily consist of term SOFR-indexed interest rate derivatives. 119 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Significant Level 3 Fair Value Asset and Liability Inputs Generally, uncertainties in fair value measurements of financial instruments, such as changes in unobservable inputs, may have a significant impact on fair value. Certain of these unobservable inputs will, in isolation, have a directionally consistent impact on the fair value of the instrument for a given change in that input. Alternatively, the fair value of the instrument may move in an opposite direction for a given change in another input. In general, an increase in the discount rate, default rates, loss severity or credit spreads, in isolation, would result in a decrease in the fair value measurement. In addition, an increase in default rates would generally be accompanied by a decrease in recovery rates, slower prepayment rates and an increase in liquidity spreads, and would lead to a decrease in the fair value measurement. Techniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value Measureme nts The following table presents the significant unobservable inputs used to determine the fair values of our Level 3 financial instruments on a recurring basis. We utilize multiple vendor pricing services to obtain fair value for our securities. Several of our vendor pricing services are only able to provide unobservable input information for a limited number of securities due to software licensing restrictions. Other vendor pricing services are able to provide unobservable input information for all securities for which they provide a valuation. As a result, the unobservable input information for the securities available for sale presented below represents a composite summary of all information we are able to obtain. The unobservable input information for all other Level 3 financial instruments is based on the assumptions used in our internal valuation models.

(2) Due to the nature of the various mortgage securitization structures in which we have retained interests, it is not meaningful to present a consolidated weighted average for the significant unobservable inputs. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis We are required to measure and recognize certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on the consolidated balance sheets. These assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (for example, from the application of lower of cost or fair value accounting or when we evaluate for impairment). The following table presents the carrying value of the assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and still held as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and for which a nonrecurring fair value measurement was recorded during the nine and twelve months then ended.

As of December 31, 2022, other assets included investments 121 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents accounted for under measurement alternative of $ 4 million, cost method investments of $ 3 million, repossessed assets of $ 55 million and long-lived assets held for sale and right-of-use assets totaling $ 158 million. In the above table, loans held for investment are generally valued based in part on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral and the non-recoverable rate, which is considered to be a significant unobservable input. The non-recoverable rate ranged from 0 % to 100 %, with a weighted average of 19 %, a nd fro m 0 % to 43 %, with a weighted average of 20 %, as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The weighted average non-recoverable rate is calculated based on the estimated market value of the underlying collateral. The significant unobservable inputs and related quantitative information related to fair value of the other assets are not meaningful to disclose as they vary significantly across properties and collateral. The following table presents total nonrecurring fair value measurements for the period, included in earnings, attributable to the change in fair value relating to assets that are still held at September 30, 2023 and 2022.

The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into or managed as a part of our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio, asset/liability management by our centralized Corporate Treasury group and residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate that is not assessed to our primary business segments, are included in the Other category. Basis of Presentation We report the results of each of our business segments on a continuing operations basis. The results of our individual businesses reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources. Business Segment Reporting Methodology The results of our business segments are intended to present each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. Our internal management and reporting process used to derive our segment results employs various allocation methodologies, including funds transfer pricing, to assign certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenues and expenses directly or indirectly attributable to each business segment. Our funds transfer pricing process managed by our centralized Corporate Treasury group provides a funds credit for sources of funds, such as deposits generated by our Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking businesses, and a charge for the use of funds by each segment. The allocation is unique to each business segment and acquired business and is based on the composition of assets and liabilities. The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet products. Periodically the methodology and assumptions utilized in the funds transfer pricing process are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other factors, which may impact the allocation of net interest income to the business segments. Due to the integrated nature of our business segments, estimates and judgments have been made in allocating certain revenue and expense items. Transactions between segments are based on specific criteria or approximate market rate. We regularly assess the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, which may result in the implementation of refinements or changes in future periods. We provide additional information on the allocation methodologies used to derive our business segment results in Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 17 Business Segments and Revenue from Contracts with Customers in our 2022 Form 10-K. Segment Results and Reconciliation We may periodically change our business segments or reclassify business segment results based on modifications to our management reporting methodologies or changes in organizational alignment. The following table presents our business segment results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, selected balance sheet data as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and a reconciliation of our total business segment results to our reported consolidated income from continuing operations, loans held for investment and deposits. 124 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 12.1: Segment Results and Reconciliation Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 (Dollars in millions) Credit Card Consumer Banking Commercial Banking (1) Other (1) Consolidated Total Net interest income (loss) $ 5,114 $ 2,133 $ 621 $ ( 445 ) $ 7,423 Non-interest income 1,513 142 288 0 1,943 Total net revenue (loss) (2) 6,627 2,275 909 ( 445 ) 9,366 Provision for credit losses 1,953 213 116 2 2,284 Non-interest expense 3,015 1,262 512 71 4,860 Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes 1,659 800 281 ( 518 ) 2,222 Income tax provision (benefit) 393 189 67 ( 217 ) 432 Income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax $ 1,266 $ 611 $ 214 $ ( 301 ) $ 1,790 Loans held for investment $ 146,783 $ 76,844 $ 91,153 $ 0 $ 314,780 Deposits 0 290,789 36,035 19,187 346,011 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 (Dollars in millions) Credit Card Consumer Banking Commercial Banking (1) Other (1) Consolidated Total Net interest income (loss) $ 14,498 $ 6,762 $ 1,901 $ ( 1,439 ) $ 21,722 Non-interest income 4,375 426 757 1 5,559 Total net revenue (loss) (2) 18,873 7,188 2,658 ( 1,438 ) 27,281 Provision for credit losses 6,298 747 521 3 7,569 Non-interest expense 9,073 3,776 1,524 226 14,599 Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes 3,502 2,665 613 ( 1,667 ) 5,113 Income tax provision (benefit) 830 629 145 ( 672 ) 932 Income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax $ 2,672 $ 2,036 $ 468 $ ( 995 ) $ 4,181 Loans held for investment $ 146,783 $ 76,844 $ 91,153 $ 0 $ 314,780 Deposits 0 290,789 36,035 19,187 346,011 Three Months Ended September 30, 2022 (Dollars in millions) Credit Card Consumer Banking Commercial Banking (1) Other (1) Consolidated Total Net interest income (loss) $ 4,313 $ 2,311 $ 699 $ ( 320 ) $ 7,003 Non-interest income (loss) 1,454 129 319 ( 100 ) 1,802 Total net revenue (loss) (2) 5,767 2,440 1,018 ( 420 ) 8,805 Provision (benefit) for credit losses 1,261 285 123 0 1,669 Non-interest expense 3,004 1,340 542 63 4,949 Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes 1,502 815 353 ( 483 ) 2,187 Income tax provision (benefit) 356 193 83 ( 139 ) 493 Income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax $ 1,146 $ 622 $ 270 $ ( 344 ) $ 1,694 Loans held for investment $ 126,913 $ 81,199 $ 95,831 $ 0 $ 303,943 Deposits 0 256,661 41,058 19,474 317,193 125 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 (Dollars in millions) Credit Card Consumer Banking Commercial Banking (1) Other (1) Consolidated Total Net interest income (loss) $ 12,051 $ 6,571 $ 1,941 $ ( 646 ) $ 19,917 Non-interest income (loss) 4,322 330 868 ( 227 ) 5,293 Total net revenue (loss) (2) 16,373 6,901 2,809 ( 873 ) 25,210 Provision (benefit) for credit losses 2,387 696 353 ( 5 ) 3,431 Non-interest expense 8,558 3,862 1,515 148 14,083 Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes 5,428 2,343 941 ( 1,016 ) 7,696 Income tax provision (benefit) 1,291 555 223 ( 501 ) 1,568 Income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax $ 4,137 $ 1,788 $ 718 $ ( 515 ) $ 6,128 Loans held for investment $ 126,913 $ 81,199 $ 95,831 $ 0 $ 303,943 Deposits 0 256,661 41,058 19,474 317,193 _________ (1) Some of our commercial investments generate tax-exempt income, tax credits or other tax benefits. Accordingly, we present our Commercial Banking revenue and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated using the federal statutory tax rate of 21% and state taxes where applicable, with offsetting reductions to the Other category. (2) Total net revenue was reduced by $ 449 million and $ 1.3 billion in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, and $ 222 million and $ 625 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, for credit card finance charges and fees charged off as uncollectible. Revenue from Contracts with Customers The majority of our revenue from contracts with customers consists of interchange fees, service charges and other customer-related fees, and other contract revenue. Interchange fees are primarily from our Credit Card business and are recognized upon settlement with the interchange networks, net of rewards earned by customers. Service charges and other customer-related fees within our Consumer Banking business are primarily related to fees earned on consumer deposit accounts for account maintenance and various transaction-based services such as automated teller machine ( ATM ) usage. Service charges and other customer-related fees within our Commercial Banking business are mostly related to fees earned on treasury management and capital markets services. Other contract revenue in our Credit Card business consists primarily of revenue from our partnership arrangements. Other contract revenue in our Consumer Banking business consists primarily of revenue earned on certain marketing and promotional events from our auto dealers. Revenue from contracts with customers is included in non-interest income in our consolidated statements of income. The following table presents revenue from contracts with customers and a reconciliation to non-interest income by business segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022.

(2) Interchange fees are presented net of customer reward expenses . 127 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents NOTE 13 COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES, GUARANTEES AND OTHERS Commitments to Lend Our unfunded lending commitments primarily consist of credit card lines, loan commitments to customers of both our Commercial Banking and Consumer Banking businesses, as well as standby and commercial letters of credit. These commitments, other than credit card lines and certain other unconditionally cancellable lines of credit, are legally binding conditional agreements that have fixed expirations or termination dates and specified interest rates and purposes. The contractual amount of these commitments represents the maximum possible credit risk to us should the counterparty draw upon the commitment. We generally manage the potential risk of unfunded lending commitments by limiting the total amount of arrangements, monitoring the size and maturity structure of these portfolios and applying the same credit standards for all of our credit activities. For unused credit card lines, we have not experienced and do not anticipate that all of our customers will access their entire available line at any given point in time. Commitments to extend credit other than credit card lines generally require customers to maintain certain credit standards. Collateral requirements and loan-to-value ( LTV ) ratios are the same as those for funded transactions and are established based on management credit assessment of the customer. These commitments may expire without being drawn upon; therefore, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future funding requirements. We also issue letters of credit, such as financial standby, performance standby and commercial letters of credit, to meet the financing needs of our customers. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party in a borrowing arrangement. Commercial letters of credit are short-term commitments issued primarily to facilitate trade finance activities for customers and are generally collateralized by the goods being shipped to the customer. These collateral requirements are similar to those for funded transactions and are established based on management credit assessment of the customer. Management conducts regular reviews of all outstanding letters of credit and the results of these reviews are considered in assessing the adequacy of reserves for unfunded lending commitments. The following table presents the contractual amount and carrying value of our unfunded lending commitments as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The carrying value represents our reserve and deferred revenue on legally binding commitments. Table 13.1: Unfunded Lending Commitments Contractual Amount Carrying Value (Dollars in millions) September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Credit card lines $ 390,477 $ 359,507 N/A N/A Other loan commitments (1) 47,280 48,405 $ 102 $ 176 Standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit (2) 1,441 1,402 23 28 Total unfunded lending commitments $ 439,198 $ 409,314 $ 125 $ 204 __________ (1) Includes $ 5.1 billion and $ 4.4 billion of advised lines of credit as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. (2) These financial guarantees have expiration dates that range from 2024 to 2027 as of September 30, 2023. Loss Sharing Agreements Within our Commercial Banking business, we originate multifamily commercial real estate loans with the intent to sell them to the GSEs. We enter into loss sharing agreements with the GSEs upon the sale of these originated loans. Beginning January 1, 2020, we elected the fair value option on new loss sharing agreements entered into. Unrealized gains and losses are recorded in other non-interest income in our consolidated statements of income. For those loss sharing agreements entered into as of and prior to December 31, 2019, we amortize the liability recorded at inception into non-interest income as we are released from risk of having to make a payment and record our estimate of expected credit losses each period through the provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of income. The liability recognized on our consolidated balance sheets for these loss sharing agreements was $ 117 million and $ 82 million as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. See Note 4 Allowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments for information related to our credit card partnership loss sharing arrangements. 128 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Litigation In accordance with the current accounting standards for loss contingencies, we establish reserves for litigation-related matters that arise from the ordinary course of our business activities when it is probable that a loss associated with a claim or proceeding has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. None of the amounts we currently have recorded individually or in the aggregate are considered to be material to our financial condition. Litigation claims and proceedings of all types are subject to many uncertain factors that generally cannot be predicted with assurance. Below we provide a description of potentially material legal proceedings and claims. For some of the matters disclosed below, we are able to estimate reasonably possible losses above existing reserves, and for other disclosed matters, such an estimate is not possible at this time. For those matters below where an estimate is possible, management currently estimates the reasonably possible future losses beyond our reserves as of September 30, 2023 are approximately $ 200 million. Our reserve and reasonably possible loss estimates involve considerable judgment and reflect that there is still significant uncertainty regarding numerous factors that may impact the ultimate loss levels. Notwithstanding, our attempt to estimate a reasonably possible range of loss beyond our current accrual levels for some litigation matters based on current information, it is possible that actual future losses will exceed both the current accrual level and the range of reasonably possible losses disclosed here. Given the inherent uncertainties involved in these matters, especially those involving governmental agencies, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters, there is significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability we may incur from these litigation matters and an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period. Interchange In 2005, a putative class of retail merchants filed antitrust lawsuits against MasterCard and Visa and several issuing banks, including Capital One, seeking both injunctive relief and monetary damages for an alleged conspiracy by defendants to fix the level of interchange fees. Other merchants have asserted similar claims in separate lawsuits, and while these separate cases did not name any issuing banks, Visa, MasterCard and issuers, including Capital One, have entered settlement and judgment sharing agreements allocating the liabilities of any judgment or settlement arising from all interchange-related cases. The lawsuits were consolidated before the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York for certain purposes and were settled in 2012. The class settlement, however, was invalidated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in June 2016, and the suit was bifurcated into separate class actions seeking injunctive and monetary relief, respectively. In addition, numerous merchant groups opted out of the 2012 settlement and have pursued their own claims. The claims by the injunctive relief class have not been resolved, but the settlement of $ 5.5 billion for the monetary damages class received final approval from the trial court, and has been appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Visa and MasterCard have also settled a number of the opt-out cases, which required non-material payments from issuing banks, including Capital One. Visa created a litigation escrow account following its initial public offering of stock in 2008 that funds settlements for its member banks, and any settlements related to MasterCard-allocated losses have either already been paid or are reflected in our reserves. Cybersecurity Incident On July 29, 2019, we announced that on March 22 and 23, 2019 an outside individual gained unauthorized access to our systems. This individual obtained certain types of personal information relating to people who had applied for our credit card products and to our credit card customers (the Cybersecurity Incident ). As a result of the Cybersecurity Incident, we have been subject to numerous legal proceedings and other inquiries and could be the subject of additional proceedings and inquiries in the future. Consumer class actions . We are named as a defendant in 5 putative consumer class action cases in Canadian courts alleging harm from the Cybersecurity Incident and seeking various remedies, including monetary and injunctive relief. The lawsuits allege breach of contract, negligence, violations of various privacy laws and a variety of other legal causes of action. In the second quarter of 2022, a trial court in British Columbia preliminarily certified a class of all impacted Canadian consumers except those in Quebec, which would allow the case to proceed with discovery on a classwide basis under Canadian law. The preliminary certification decision in British Columbia has been appealed. In the third quarter of 2023, a trial court in Quebec preliminarily authorized a class of all impacted consumers in Quebec. This decision also has been appealed. Proceedings are continuing in parallel in Ontario and Alberta. 129 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Governmental inquiries. In August 2020, we entered into consent orders with the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) resulting from regulatory reviews of the Cybersecurity Incident and relating to ongoing enhancements of our cybersecurity and operational risk management processes. We paid an $ 80 million penalty to the U.S. Treasury as part of the OCC agreement. The Federal Reserve agreement did not contain a monetary penalty. The OCC lifted its consent order on August 31, 2022 and the Federal Reserve lifted its consent order on July 5, 2023. Canada Office of Privacy Commissioner ( OPC ) investigation into the Cybersecurity Incident is still open. Walmart Litigation On April 7, 2023, Walmart filed a lawsuit in the Southern District of New York seeking a declaratory judgment that it has the contractual right to early termination of the credit card partnership agreement under which we are the exclusive issuer of Walmart private label and co-branded credit card program in the U.S. and share in certain related economics. On May 2, 2023, Walmart filed an amended complaint in which it also alleges breach of contract and seeks damages caused by any delay in termination. On May 4, 2023, we filed an Answer and Counterclaim to Walmart amended complaint, denying that Walmart has any right to terminate the partnership and alleging that Walmart has breached its contractual obligations to Capital One. U.K. PPI Litigation In the U.K., we previously sold payment protection insurance ( PPI ). For several years leading up to the claims submission deadline of August 29, 2019 (as set by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority), we received customer complaints and regulatory claims relating to PPI. COEP has materially resolved the PPI complaints and regulatory claims received prior to the deadline. Some of the claimants in the U.K. PPI regulatory claims process have subsequently initiated legal proceedings, seeking additional redress. We are responding to these proceedings as we receive them. Savings Account Litigation In July 2023, Capital One was sued in a putative class action in the Eastern District of Virginia by savings account holders alleging breach of contract and a variety of other causes of action relating to Capital One introduction of a new savings account product with a higher interest rate than existing savings account products. Capital One intends to file its response to the lawsuit in the fourth quarter of 2023. Other Pending and Threatened Litigation In addition, we are commonly subject to various pending and threatened legal actions relating to the conduct of our normal business activities. In the opinion of management, the ultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising out of all such other pending or threatened legal actions is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial position or our results of operations. 130 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk For a discussion of the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, see Part I Item 2. MD&A Market Risk Profile. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Overview We are required under applicable laws and regulations to maintain controls and procedures, which include disclosure controls and procedures as well as internal control over financial reporting, as further described below. (a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures refer to controls and other procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our financial reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding our required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and we must apply judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ), our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2023, the end of the period covered by this Report. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2023, at a reasonable level of assurance, in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting information required to be disclosed within the time periods specified by the SEC rules and forms.
