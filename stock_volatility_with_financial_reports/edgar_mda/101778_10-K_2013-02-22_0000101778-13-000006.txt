Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations We are an international energy company with operations in the U.S., Canada, Africa, the Middle East and Europe. Our operations are organized into three reportable segments: E&P which explores for, produces and markets liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas on a worldwide basis. OSM which mines, extracts and transports bitumen from oil sands deposits in Alberta, Canada, and upgrades the bitumen to produce and market synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil. IG which produces and markets products manufactured from natural gas, such as LNG and methanol, in E.G. Certain sections of Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations include forward-looking statements concerning trends or events potentially affecting our business. These statements typically contain words such as "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "expects," "targets," "plans," "projects," "could," "may," "should," "would" or similar words indicating that future outcomes are uncertain. In accordance with "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, these statements are accompanied by cautionary language identifying important factors, though not necessarily all such factors, which could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in forward-looking statements. For additional risk factors affecting our business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the information under Item 1. Business, Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data found in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Spin-off Downstream Business On June 30, 2011, the spin-off of Marathon downstream business was completed, creating two independent energy companies: Marathon Oil and MPC. Marathon stockholders at the close of business on the record date of June 27, 2011 received one share of MPC common stock for every two shares of Marathon common stock held. A private letter tax ruling received in June 2011 from the IRS affirmed the tax-free nature of the spin-off. Activities related to the downstream business have been treated as discontinued operations in 2011 and 2010 (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information). Overview Market Conditions Exploration and Production Prevailing prices for the various grades of crude oil and natural gas that we produce significantly impact our revenues and cash flows. The following table lists benchmark crude oil and natural gas price annual averages for the past three years. Benchmark 2012 2011 2010 WTI crude oil (Dollars per bbl) $94.15 $95.11 $79.61 Brent (Europe) crude oil (Dollars per bbl) $111.65 $111.26 $79.51 Henry Hub natural gas (Dollars per mmbtu) (a) $2.79 $4.04 $4.39 (a) Settlement date average. Liquid hydrocarbon Prices of crude oil have been volatile in recent years, but less so when comparing annual averages for 2012 and 2011. In 2011, crude prices increased over 2010 levels, with increases in Brent averages outstripping those in WTI. The quality, location and composition of our liquid hydrocarbon production mix will cause our U.S. liquid hydrocarbon realizations to differ from the WTI benchmark. In 2012, 2011 and 2010, the percentage of our U.S. crude oil and condensate production that was sour averaged 37 percent, 58 percent and 68 percent. Sour crude contains more sulfur and tends to be heavier than light sweet crude oil so that refining it is more costly and produces lower value products; therefore, sour crude is considered of lower quality and typically sells at a discount to WTI. The percentage of our U.S. crude and condensate production that is sour has been decreasing as onshore production from the Eagle Ford and Bakken shale plays increases and production from the Gulf of Mexico declines. In recent years, crude oil sold along the U.S. Gulf Coast has been priced at a premium to WTI because the Louisiana Light Sweet benchmark has been tracking Brent, while production from inland areas farther from large refineries has been at a discount to WTI. NGLs were 10 percent, 7 percent and 6 percent of our U.S. liquid hydrocarbon sales in 2012, 2011 and 2010. In 2012, our sales of NGLs increased due to our development of U.S. unconventional liquids-rich plays. 35 Our international crude oil production is relatively sweet and is generally sold in relation to the Brent crude benchmark. The differential between WTI and Brent average prices widened significantly in 2011 and remained in 2012 in comparison to almost no differential in 2010. Natural gas A significant portion of our natural gas production in the lower 48 states of the U.S. is sold at bid-week prices or first-of-month indices relative to our specific producing areas. Average Henry Hub settlement prices for natural gas were lower in 2012 than in recent years. A decline in average settlement date Henry Hub natural gas prices began in September 2011 and continued into 2012. Although prices stabilized in late 2012, they have not increased appreciably. Our other major natural gas-producing regions are E.G. and Europe. In the case of E.G,. our natural gas sales are subject to term contracts, making realizations less volatile. Because natural gas sales from E.G. are at fixed prices, our worldwide reported average natural gas realizations may not fully track market price movements. Natural gas prices in Europe have been significantly higher than in the U.S. Oil Sands Mining The OSM segment produces and sells various qualities of synthetic crude oil. Output mix can be impacted by operational problems or planned unit outages at the mines or upgrader. Sales prices for roughly two-thirds of the normal output mix will track movements in WTI and one-third will track movements in the Canadian heavy sour crude oil marker, primarily WCS. In 2012, the WCS discount from WTI had increased, putting downward pressure on our average realizations. The operating cost structure of the OSM operations is predominantly fixed and therefore many of the costs incurred in times of full operation continue during production downtime. Per-unit costs are sensitive to production rates. Key variable costs are natural gas and diesel fuel, which track commodity markets such as the Canadian Alberta Energy Company ("AECO") natural gas sales index and crude oil prices, respectively. The table below shows average benchmark prices that impact both our revenues and variable costs. Benchmark 2012 2011 2010 WTI crude oil (Dollars per bbl) $94.15 $95.11 $79.61 WCS (Dollars per bbl) (a) $73.18 $77.97 $65.31 AECO natural gas sales index (Dollars per mmbtu) (b) $2.39 $3.68 $3.89 (a) Monthly pricing based upon average WTI adjusted for differentials unique to western Canada. (b) Monthly average day ahead index. Integrated Gas Our IG operations include production and marketing of products manufactured from natural gas, such as LNG and methanol, in E.G. World LNG trade in 2012 has been estimated to be 240 mmt. Long-term, LNG continues to be in demand as markets seek the benefits of clean burning natural gas. Market prices for LNG are not reported or posted. In general, LNG delivered to the U.S. is tied to Henry Hub prices and will track with changes in U.S. natural gas prices, while LNG sold in Europe and Asia is indexed to crude oil prices and will track the movement of those prices. We have a 60 percent ownership in an LNG production facility in E.G., which sells LNG under a long-term contract at prices tied to Henry Hub natural gas prices. Gross sales from the plant were 3.8 mmt, 4.1 mmt and 3.7 mmt in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 . We own a 45 percent interest in a methanol plant located in E.G. through our investment in AMPCO. Gross sales of methanol from the plant totaled 1.1 mmt, 1.0 mmt and 0.9 mmt in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 . Methanol demand has a direct impact on AMPCO earnings. Because global demand for methanol is rather limited, changes in the supply-demand balance can have a significant impact on sales prices. World demand for methanol in 2012 has been estimated to be 49 mmt. Our plant capacity of 1.1 mmt is about 2 percent of world demand. 36 Key Operating and Financial Activities Significant operating and financial activities during 2012 include: Net proved reserve additions for the E&P and OSM segments combined of 389 mmboe, for a 226 percent reserve replacement ratio Increased proved liquid hydrocarbon and synthetic crude oil reserves by 316 mmbbls, for a reserve replacement of 268 percent for these commodities Recorded more than 95 percent average operational availability for operated E&P assets Increased E&P net sales volumes, excluding Libya, by 8 percent Eagle Ford shale average net sales volumes of 65 mboed for December 2012, a fourfold increase over December 2011 Bakken shale average net sales volumes of 29 mboed, a 71 percent increase over last year Resumed sales from Libya and reached pre-conflict production levels International liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes, for which average realizations have exceeded WTI, were 62 percent of net E&P liquid hydrocarbon sales Closed $1 billion of acquisitions in the core of the Eagle Ford shale Assumed operatorship of the Vilje field located offshore Norway Signed agreements for new exploration positions in E.G., Gabon, Kenya and Ethiopia Issued $1 billion of 3-year senior notes at 0.9 percent interest and $1 billion of 10-year senior notes at 2.8 percent interest Some significant 2013 activities through February 22, 2013 include: Closed sale of our Alaska assets in January 2013 Closed sale of our interest in the Neptune gas plant in February 2013 Consolidated Results of Operations: 2012 compared to 2011 Consolidated income before income taxes was 38 percent higher in 2012 than consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes were in 2011, largely due to higher liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes in our E&P segment, partially offset by lower earnings from our OSM and IG segments. The 7 percent decrease in income from continuing operations included lower earnings in the U.K. and E.G., partially offset by higher earnings in Libya. Also, in 2011 we were not in an excess foreign tax credit position for the entire year as we were in 2012. The effective income tax rate for continuing operations was 74 percent in 2012 compared to 61 percent in 2011. Revenues are summarized in the following table: (In millions) 2012 2011 E&P $ 14,084 $ 13,029 OSM 1,552 1,588 IG 93 Segment revenues 15,636 14,710 Elimination of intersegment revenues (47 ) Unrealized gain on crude oil derivative instruments 52 Total revenues $ 15,688 $ 14,663 E&P segment revenues increased $1,055 million from 2011 to 2012, primarily due to higher average liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes. E&P segment revenues included a net realized gain on crude oil derivative instruments of $15 million in 2012 while the impact of derivatives was not significant in 2011. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 16 to the consolidated financial statement for more information about our crude oil derivative instruments. Included in our E&P segment are supply optimization activities which include the purchase of commodities from third parties for resale. See the Cost of revenues discussion as revenues from supply optimization approximate the related costs. Supply optimization serves to aggregate volumes in order to satisfy transportation commitments and to achieve flexibility within product 37 types and delivery points. Volumes associated with supply optimization have been decreasing in 2012 due to market dynamics and related commodity prices were also slightly lower in 2012. Revenues from the sale of our U.S. production are higher in 2012 than in 2011 as a result of increased liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes from our U.S. shale plays. Lower liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas realizations partially offset the volume impact. The following table gives details of net sales and average realizations of our U.S. operations. 2012 2011 U.S. Operating Statistics Net liquid hydrocarbon sales (mbbld) 107 75 Liquid hydrocarbon average realizations (per bbl) (a)(b) $85.80 $92.55 Net crude oil and condensate sales (mbbld) 96 70 Crude oil and condensate (per bbl) $91.29 $94.80 Net natural gas liquids sales (mbbld) 11 5 Natural gas liquids (per bbl) $39.57 $58.53 Net natural gas sales (mmcfd) 358 326 Natural gas average realizations (per mcf) (a) $3.91 $4.95 (a) Excludes gains or losses on derivative instruments. (b) Inclusion of realized gains on crude oil derivative instruments would have increased average liquid hydrocarbon realizations $0.39 per bbl for 2012. Revenues from our international operations are higher in 2012 than in 2011 primarily as a result of the previously discussed resumption of liquid hydrocarbon sales from Libya. Higher average liquid hydrocarbon realizations during 2012, again primarily related to Libyan crude oil, also contributed to the revenue increase. The following table gives details of net sales and average realizations of our international operations. 2012 2011 International Operating Statistics Net liquid hydrocarbon sales (mbbld) (a) Europe 97 101 Africa 78 43 Total International 175 144 Liquid hydrocarbon average realizations (per bbl) (b) Europe $115.16 $115.55 Africa $98.52 $73.21 Total International $107.78 $102.96 Net natural gas sales (mmcfd) Europe (c) 101 97 Africa 443 443 Total International 544 540 Natural gas average realizations (per mcf) (b) Europe $10.47 $9.84 Africa (d) $0.43 $0.24 Total International $2.29 $1.97 (a) The amounts correspond with the basis for fiscal settlements with governments, representing equity tanker liftings and direct deliveries of liquid hydrocarbons. (b) Excludes gains or losses on derivative instruments. (c) Includes natural gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale of 15 mmcfd and 16 mmcfd in 2012 and 2011 . (d) Primarily represents fixed prices under long-term contracts with Alba Plant LLC, AMPCO and EGHoldings, equity method investees. We include our share of Alba Plant LLC income in our E&P segment and we include our share of AMPCO and EGHoldings income in our IG segment. OSM segment revenues decreased $36 million from 2011 to 2012. The decrease was primarily the result of lower average realizations which were partially offset by the increase in sales volumes. 38 2012 2011 OSM Operating Statistics Net synthetic crude oil sales (mbbld) (a) 47 43 Synthetic crude oil average realizations (per bbl) $81.72 $91.65 (a) Includes bloodstocks. IG segment revenues decreased to zero in 2012 from $93 million in 2011. Sales of LNG from our Alaska operations ceased in the third quarter of 2011 when we sold our interest in this production facility. Income from equity method investments decreased $92 million from 2011 to 2012 primarily due to lower natural gas prices and turnarounds early in 2012 at our facilities in E.G. Also, in January 2012, we sold our equity investments in several Gulf of Mexico crude oil pipelines. Net gain on disposal of assets in 2012 consists primarily of the $166 million gain on the sale of our interests in several Gulf of Mexico crude oil pipeline systems, reduced by the $36 million loss on the assignment of our Bone Bay and Kumawa exploration licenses in Indonesia and the $18 million loss on the sale of non-core Eagle Ford acreage. In 2011, net gain on disposal of assets is primarily related to sales of non-core assets, such as the Burns Point gas plant and the Alaska LNG facility, and the assignment of interests in our DJ Basin acreage position. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for information about these dispositions. Cost of revenues decreased $1,006 million from 2011 to 2012 primarily related to our supply optimization activities. Comparatively, costs related to supply optimization were lower by $1,152 million for 2012, primarily due to lower volumes in 2012 due to market dynamics. The related commodity prices were also slightly lower in 2012. Excluding the impact of supply optimization activities, E&P segment operating expenses have increased in proportion to our increased production from U.S. shale plays. Additionally, IG segment costs are lower in 2012 due to the sale of our interest in the Alaska LNG facility in the third quarter of 2011. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $212 million from 2011 to 2012. Since both our E&P and OSM segments apply the units-of-production method to the majority of their assets, the previously discussed increases in sales volumes generally result in similar changes in DD&A. Increased DD&A in 2012 primarily reflects the impact of higher sales volumes. There was no depletion of our Alaska assets for much of 2012 because they were held for sale, which partially offset the DD&A increase. The DD&A rate (expense per barrel of oil equivalent), which is impacted by changes in proved reserves and capitalized costs, can also cause changes in our DD&A. Our E&P segment's DD&A rates have decreased slightly since 2011 primarily due to proved reserve additions. The following table provides DD&A rates for our E&P and OSM segments. ($ per boe) 2012 2011 DD&A rate E&P Segment United States $ 24 $ 25 International 8 10 OSM Segment $ 13 $ 13 Impairments in 2012 related primarily to our Ozona development in the Gulf of Mexico and to our Powder River Basin asset in Wyoming. Impairments in 2011 related primarily to our Droshky development in the Gulf of Mexico and an intangible asset for an LNG delivery contract at Elba Island. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the impairments. Other taxes increased $59 million from 2011 to 2012. With the increase in revenues related to higher sales volumes, production taxes increased. In addition, ad valorem taxes are higher because the value of our U.S. assets has increased with the recent acquisitions in the Eagle Ford shale. Exploration expenses were higher in 2012 than 2011 primarily due to larger unproved property impairments. Unproved property impairments in 2012 related to the Marcellus shale, the Eagle Ford shale and Indonesia. The following table summarizes the components of exploration expenses. 39 (In millions) 2012 2011 Unproved property impairments $ 227 $ 79 Dry well costs 230 278 Geological, geophysical, seismic 128 120 Other 144 167 Total exploration expenses $ 729 $ 644 Net interest and other increased $112 million from 2011 to 2012 primarily as a result of less interest expense capitalized. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on net interest and other. Loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2011 relates to debt retirements in February and March of 2011. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these transactions. Provision for income taxes increased $1,811 million from 2011 to 2012 primarily due to the increase in pretax income, including the impact of the previously discussed resumption of sales in Libya in the first quarter of 2012. The following is an analysis of the effective income tax rates for 2012 and 2011: 2012 2011 Statutory rate applied to income from continuing operations before income taxes 35 % 35 % Effects of foreign operations, including foreign tax credits 18 6 Change in permanent reinvestment assertion 5 Adjustments to valuation allowances 21 14 Tax law changes 1 Effective income tax rate on continuing operations 74 % 61 % The effective income tax rate is influenced by a variety of factors including the geographic and functional sources of income, the relative magnitude of these sources of income, and foreign currency remeasurement effects. The provision for income taxes is allocated on a discrete, stand-alone basis to pretax segment income and to individual items not allocated to segments. The difference between the total provision and the sum of the amounts allocated to segments and to individual items not allocated to segments is reported in "Corporate and other unallocated items" shown in the reconciliation of segment income to net income below. Effects of foreign operations The effects of foreign operations on our effective tax rate increased in 2012 as compared to 2011 , primarily due to the resumption of sales of Libyan production in first quarter of 2012, where the statutory tax rate is in excess of 90 percent. Change in permanent reinvestment assertion In the second quarter of 2011, we recorded $716 million of deferred U.S. tax on undistributed earnings of $2,046 million that we previously intended to permanently reinvest in foreign operations. Offsetting this tax expense were associated foreign tax credits of $488 million. In addition, we reduced our valuation allowance related to foreign tax credits by $228 million due to recognizing deferred U.S. tax on previously undistributed earnings. Adjustments to valuation allowances In 2012 and 2011, we increased the valuation allowance against foreign tax credits because it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize all U.S. benefits on foreign taxes accrued in those years. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about income taxes. Discontinued operations in 2011 reflect the June 30, 2011 spin-off of our downstream business and its historical operating results, net of tax. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. 40 Segment Results: 2012 compared to 2011 Segment income for 2012 and 2011 is summarized and reconciled to net income in the following table. (In millions) 2012 2011 E&P United States $ 393 $ 366 International 1,488 1,791 E&P segment 1,881 2,157 OSM 176 256 IG 91 178 Segment income 2,148 2,591 Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes: Corporate and other unallocated items (441 ) (317 ) Impairments (231 ) (195 ) Gain on dispositions 72 45 Unrealized gain on crude oil derivative instruments 34 Loss on early extinguishment of debt (176 ) Tax effect of subsidiary restructuring (122 ) Deferred income tax items (61 ) Water abatement - Oil Sands (48 ) Eagle Ford transaction costs (10 ) Income from continuing operations 1,582 1,707 Discontinued operations 1,239 Net income $ 1,582 $ 2,946 U.S. E&P income increased $27 million from 2011 to 2012. The income increase was primarily the result of higher liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes as previously discussed, partially offset by lower liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas realizations and the impact of increased production operations on DD&A and operating expenses. In addition, exploration expenses were higher primarily due to dry wells and unproved property impairments. International E&P income decreased $303 million from 2011 to 2012. The decrease included lower earnings in the U.K. and E.G. partially offset by higher earnings in Libya. Also, in 2011 we were not in an excess foreign tax credit position for the entire year as we were in 2012. OSM segment income decreased $80 million from 2011 to 2012. As previously discussed, lower synthetic crude oil price realizations were the primary reason for the decrease in income partially offset by higher sales volumes. IG segment income decreased $87 million from 2011 to 2012 primarily due to lower natural gas prices and turnarounds early in 2012 at our facilities in E.G. In addition, LNG sales volumes are lower in 2012 because we sold our interest in the Alaska LNG facility in the third quarter of 2011. Consolidated Results of Operations: 2011 compared to 2010 Due to the spin-off of our downstream business on June 30, 2011, which is reported as discontinued operations, income from continuing operations is more representative of Marathon Oil as an independent energy company. Consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes was 9 percent higher in 2011 than in 2010, largely due to higher liquid hydrocarbon prices. This improvement was more than offset by increased income taxes primarily the result of excess foreign tax credits generated during 2011 that we do not expect to utilize in the future. The effective income tax rate for continuing operations was 61 percent in 2011 compared to 54 percent in 2010. 41 Revenues are summarized in the following table: (In millions) 2011 2010 E&P $ 13,029 $ 10,782 OSM 1,588 833 IG 93 150 Segment revenues 14,710 11,765 Elimination of intersegment revenues (47 ) (75 ) Total revenues $ 14,663 $ 11,690 E&P segment revenues increased $2,247 million from 2010 to 2011, primarily due to higher average liquid hydrocarbon realizations, which were $99.37 per bbl in 2011, a 31 percent increase over 2010. Revenues in 2010 included net pre-tax gains of $95 million on derivative instruments intended to mitigate price risk on future sales of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas. Included in our E&P segment are supply optimization activities which include the purchase of commodities from third parties for resale. Supply optimization serves to aggregate volumes in order to satisfy transportation commitments and to achieve flexibility within product types and delivery points. See the Cost of revenues discussion as revenues from supply optimization approximate the related costs. Higher average crude oil prices in 2011 compared to 2010 increased revenues related to supply optimization. Revenues from the sale of our U.S. production were higher in 2011 primarily as a result of higher liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas price realizations, but sales volumes declined. The following table gives details of net sales and average realizations of our U.S. operations. 2011 2010 U.S. Operating Statistics Net liquid hydrocarbon sales (mbbld) 75 70 Liquid hydrocarbon average realizations (per bbl) (a) $ 92.55 $ 72.30 Net crude oil and condensate sales (mbbld) 70 66 Crude oil and condensate (per bbl) $ 94.80 $ 73.66 Net natural gas liquids sales (mbbld) 5 4 Natural gas liquids (per bbl) $ 58.53 $ 50.71 Net natural gas sales (mmcfd) 326 364 Natural gas average realizations (per mcf) (a) $ 4.95 $ 4.71 (a) Excludes gains or losses on derivative instruments. Increased liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes in 2011 were a result of new wells in the Bakken shale, new production from acreage acquired in the Eagle Ford shale and increased production from the Droshky development in the Gulf of Mexico, which commenced operations in July 2010. Natural gas sales volumes were lower in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to the sale of a portion of our Powder River Basin asset in 2010, decreased demand in Alaska and natural field declines, partly offset by increased natural gas production from the Droshky development. 42 The following table gives details of net sales and average realizations of our international operations. 2011 2010 International Operating Statistics Net liquid hydrocarbon sales (mbbld) (a) Europe 101 92 Africa 43 83 Total International 144 175 Liquid hydrocarbon average realizations (per bbl) (b) Europe $115.55 $81.95 Africa $73.21 $71.71 Total International $102.96 $77.11 Net natural gas sales (mmcfd) Europe (c) 97 105 Africa 443 409 Total International 540 514 Natural gas average realizations (per mcf) (b) Europe $9.84 $7.10 Africa (d) $0.24 $0.25 Total International $1.97 $1.65 (a) The amounts correspond with the basis for fiscal settlements with governments, representing equity tanker liftings and direct deliveries of liquid hydrocarbons. (b) Excludes gains or losses on derivative instruments. (c) Includes natural gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale of 16 mmcfd and 18 mmcfd in 2011 and 2010. (d) Primarily represents fixed prices under long-term contracts with Alba Plant LLC, AMPCO and EGHoldings, equity method investees. We include our share of Alba Plant LLC income in our E&P segment and we include our share of AMPCO and EGHoldings income in our IG segment. Compared to 2010, international liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes are lower due to the temporary cessation of production from Libya in February 2011. In the fourth quarter of 2011, limited production resumed from the Waha concessions, but we made no deliveries of hydrocarbons. Sales resumed in February 2012. Partially offsetting the impact of Libya, were higher liquid hydrocarbon sales from Norway due to increasing capacity of the Alvheim FPSO and from two new West Brae wells in the U.K. Natural gas sales volumes from E.G. were higher in 2011 due to a turnaround in 2010, while natural gas sales volumes from Europe were down primarily related to 2011 planned turnarounds and normal production declines in the U.K. OSM segment revenues increased $755 million from 2010 to 2011. Revenues were impacted by net pre-tax gains of $25 million on derivative instruments in 2010. The increase in revenue is due to higher synthetic crude oil sales volumes and realizations as shown on the table below. 2011 2010 OSM Operating Statistics Net synthetic crude oil sales (mbbld) (a) 43 29 Synthetic crude oil average realizations (per bbl) $91.65 $71.06 (a) Includes blendstocks. The 2011 sales volumes improved as a result of the Jackpine mine, which commenced operations in late 2010, and the upgrader expansion which was completed and commenced operations in the second quarter of 2011. Sales volumes in 2010 were impacted by a turnaround that commenced in late March 2010 that caused production to be completely shut down in April, with a staged resumption in May 2010. IG segment revenues decreased $57 million in 2011 from 2010 because sales of LNG from our Alaska operations declined throughout 2011 as we planned to shut down the LNG facility. In the third quarter of 2011, sales from the LNG facility ceased completely because we sold our equity interest in the facility. Income from equity method investments increased $118 million in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to the impact of higher liquid hydrocarbon prices on the earnings of certain of our equity method investees in 2011. 43 Net gain on disposal of assets in 2011 is primarily related to sales of non-core assets, such as the Burns Point gas plant and the Alaska LNG facility, and the assignment of interests in our DJ Basin acreage position. The 2010 gain is primarily related to the pretax gain of $811 million on the sale of a 20 percent non-operated interest in our Production Sharing Contract and Joint Operating Agreement in Block 32 offshore Angola. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of significant dispositions. Cost of revenues increased $1,439 million from 2010 to 2011 primarily due to the impact of higher crude oil prices on our supply optimization activities. Costs related to supply optimization were $3,599 million in 2011 compared to $2,530 million in 2010. Additionally, total OSM segment costs increased for 2011 primarily because the Jackpine mine commenced production in late 2010 and the upgrader expansion came online in 2011. Although gross costs were up due to the increased volumes from the expansion, per barrel costs were declining in comparison with 2010. OSM segment costs also increased in 2011 when compared to 2010 due to the expansion operation start-up costs. These increases were partially offset by no turnaround costs in 2011. We incurred $99 million in 2010 associated with the turnaround. Additionally, estimated net costs of $64 million were recorded in 2011 to address water flow in a previously mined and contained area of the Muskeg River mine. Purchases from related parties increased $78 million from 2010 as a result of purchases from the Alba LPG plant in E.G., in which we own an equity interest. Higher liquid hydrocarbon prices in 2011 increased the value of those purchases. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $210 million in 2011 from 2010. Since both our E&P and OSM segments apply the units-of-production method to the majority of their assets, the previously discussed increases or decreases in sales volumes generally result in similar changes in DD&A. Increased DD&A expense in 2011 reflects the impact of higher OSM segment sales volumes, partially offset by decreases in E&P segment sales volumes. The DD&A rate (expense per barrel of oil equivalent), which is impacted by changes in proved reserves and capitalized costs, can also cause changes in our DD&A. The DD&A rate for the OSM segment increased in 2011 when depreciation began on the upgrader expansion. The following table provides DD&A rates for our E&P and OSM segments. ($ per boe) 2011 2010 DD&A rate E&P Segment United States $ 25 $ 22 International 10 9 OSM Segment $ 13 $ 10 Impairments in 2011 related primarily to our Droshky development in the Gulf of Mexico for $273 million and an intangible asset for an LNG delivery contract at Elba Island. Impairments in 2010 include $423 million related to our Powder River Basin field in the first quarter, as well as smaller impairments to other E&P segment fields due to reductions in estimated reserves, reduced drilling expectations and declining natural gas prices. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the impairments. General and administrative expenses increased $53 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to additional compensation expense related to performance units and stock based compensation expense. Other taxes increased $31 million in 2011 compared to 2010. With the increase in revenues, particularly related to higher prices, production and ad valorem taxes increased. Exploration expenses were higher in 2011 than 2010 primarily due to higher dry well costs. Dry wells primarily related to Indonesia, the Gulf of Mexico, Norway and various U.S. onshore properties in both 2011 and 2010. In addition, costs related to some suspended exploratory wells in E.G. were expensed in 2010. Geologic and seismic costs have increased in 2011 over 2010 primarily related to the U.S. shale plays, Poland and the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. 44 The following table summarizes components of exploration expenses: (In millions) 2011 2010 Unproved property impairments $ 79 $ 46 Dry well costs 278 179 Geological, geophysical, seismic 120 116 Other 167 159 Total exploration expenses $ 644 $ 500 Loss on early extinguishment of debt relates to debt retirements in February and March of 2011 and in April of 2010. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the 2011 transactions. Provision for income taxes increased $545 million from 2010 to 2011 in part due to the increase in pretax income. In 2011, we increased the valuation allowance against foreign tax credits because it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize all U.S. benefits on foreign taxes accrued in 2011. A higher price and production outlook over the next several years for Norway due to better than expected performance contributed to generating these excess foreign tax credits. The following is an analysis of the effective income tax rates for 2011 and 2010: 2011 2010 Statutory rate applied to income from continuing operations before income taxes 35 % 35 % Effects of foreign operations, including foreign tax credits 6 20 Change in permanent reinvestment assertion 5 Adjustments to valuation allowances 14 (2 ) Tax law changes 1 1 Effective income tax rate on continuing operations 61 % 54 % The effective tax rate is influenced by a variety of factors including the geographical and functional sources of income, the relative magnitude of these sources of income, foreign currency remeasurement effects, and tax legislation changes. The provision for income taxes is allocated on a discrete, stand-alone basis to pretax segment income and to individual items not allocated to segments. The difference between the total provision and the sum of the amounts allocated to segments and to individual items not allocated to segments is reported in "Corporate and other unallocated items" shown in the reconciliation of segment income to net income shown below. Effects of foreign operations The effects of foreign operations on our effective tax rate decreased in 2011 as compared to 2010, primarily due to the suspension of all production operations in Libya in the first quarter of 2011, where the statutory tax rate is in excess of 90 percent. Change in permanent reinvestment assertion In the second quarter of 2011, we recorded $716 million of deferred U.S. tax on undistributed earnings of $2,046 million that we previously intended to permanently reinvest in foreign operations. Offsetting this tax expense were associated foreign tax credits of $488 million. In addition, we reduced our valuation allowance related to foreign tax credits by $228 million due to recognized deferred U.S. tax on previously undistributed earnings. Adjustments to valuation allowance In 2011, we increased the valuation allowance against foreign tax credits because it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize all U.S. benefits on foreign taxes accrued in 2011. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about income taxes. Discontinued operations reflect the June 30, 2011 spin-off of our downstream business and the historical results of those operations, net of tax, for 2011 and 2010. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. 45 Segment Results: 2011 compared to 2010 Segment income for 2011 and 2010 is summarized and reconciled to net income in the following table. (In millions) 2011 2010 E&P United States $ 366 $ 251 International 1,791 1,690 E&P segment 2,157 1,941 OSM 256 (50 ) IG 178 142 Segment income 2,591 2,033 Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes: Corporate and other unallocated items (317 ) (170 ) Impairments (195 ) (286 ) Gain on dispositions 45 407 Loss on early extinguishment of debt (176 ) (57 ) Tax effect of subsidiary restructuring (122 ) Deferred income tax items (61 ) (45 ) Water abatement Oil Sands (48 ) Eagle Ford transaction costs (10 ) Income from continuing operations 1,707 1,882 Discontinued operations 1,239 686 Net income $ 2,946 $ 2,568 U.S. E&P income increased $115 million from 2010 to 2011. The majority of the income increase was due to higher liquid hydrocarbon realizations in 2011, along with higher liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes, partially offset by higher DD&A in the Gulf of Mexico and increased exploration and operating costs. International E&P income increased $101 million from 2010 to 2011. This increase was primarily related to higher liquid hydrocarbon realizations, partially offset by lower liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes and higher income taxes. OSM segment income increased $306 million from 2010 to 2011. The increase in segment income was primarily the result of higher synthetic crude oil sales volumes and higher price realizations. IG segment income increased $36 million from 2010 to 2011. The increase in income was primarily the result of higher LNG and methanol sales volumes, somewhat offset by lower Henry Hub gas prices. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, Cash Flows and Liquidity Cash Flows Net cash provided by continuing operations was $4,017 million in 2012 compared to $5,434 million in 2011 and $4,194 million in 2010. The $1,417 million decrease in 2012 was primarily the result of working capital changes related to the 2012 ramp-up of operations in the Eagle Ford shale and Libya along with the timing of tax payments. The $1,240 million increase in 2011 primarily reflects increased average realized prices. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $5,439 million in 2012 compared to net cash used in investing activities related to continuing operations of $7,174 million in 2011 and $2,157 million in 2010. Significant investing activities include acquisitions, additions to property, plant and equipment and asset disposals. Acquisitions in 2012 and 2011 included proved and unproved assets in the Eagle Ford shale play in south Texas. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the transactions. In recent years, acquisitions and capital spending in the U.S. has been increasing, related to unconventional resource plays like the Eagle Ford shale and to Gulf of Mexico exploration when drilling was once again permitted. Historically, long-term projects, which cross several years, have been the reasons for our additions to property, plant and equipment. In our E&P segment, 46 exploration and development projects in Angola impacted all three years. Development of fields tied back to the Alvheim FPSO occurred in 2010. In the OSM segment, the AOSP Expansion 1, which began in 2008, was substantially complete in 2010. Disposal of assets totaled $467 million , $518 million , and $1,368 million in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 . In 2012 , net proceeds resulted primarily from the sales of our interests in several Gulf of Mexico crude oil pipeline systems, a sell-down of our interest in the Harir and Safen blocks in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, and the final collection of proceeds on a 2009 asset sale. Several sales of non-core assets in 2011 and acreage sell-downs resulted in net proceeds of $518 million . In 2010, we closed the sale of our 20 percent non-operated undivided interest in the Production Sharing Contract and Joint Operating Agreement in Block 32 offshore Angola for $1.3 billion. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about dispositions. Financing activities related to continuing operations provided cash of $1,600 million in 2012 , but used cash of $5,211 million in 2011 and $1,343 million in 2010 . Sources of cash in 2012 included the issuance of a net $200 million in commercial paper and $2 billion in senior notes. In connection with the spin-off, we distributed $1,622 million to MPC in the second quarter of 2011. Debt repayments of $145 million , $2,877 million , and $653 million occurred in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 . Purchases of common stock used $300 million in cash during 2011. Dividend payments were uses of cash in every year. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our main sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, internally generated cash flow from operations, the issuance of notes, our committed revolving credit facility and sales of non-strategic assets. Our working capital requirements are supported by these sources and we may issue commercial paper backed by our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility to meet short-term cash requirements. We issued $13.9 billion and repaid $13.7 billion of commercial paper in 2012, leaving a balance of $200 million outstanding at December 31, 2012 . Because of the alternatives available to us as discussed above and our access to capital markets, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements including our capital spending programs, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities, share repurchase program and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies. Capital Resources Credit Arrangements and Borrowings At December 31, 2012 , we had $6,696 million in long-term debt outstanding, $184 million of which is due within one year. We do not have any triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an event of default in the case of a downgrade of our credit ratings. At December 31, 2012 , we had no borrowings against our revolving credit facility and had $200 million in commercial paper outstanding under our commercial paper program, which is backed by the revolving credit facility. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the revolving credit facility. Shelf Registration We have a universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC, under which we, as a "well-known seasoned issuer" for purpose of SEC rules, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities from time to time. 47 Cash-Adjusted Debt-To-Capital Ratio Our cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio (total debt-minus-cash to total debt-plus-equity-minus-cash) was 25 percent and 20 percent at December 31, 2012 and 2011 . (Dollars in millions) 2012 2011 Commercial paper $ 200 $ Long-term debt due within one year 184 141 Long-term debt 6,512 4,674 Total debt $ 6,896 $ 4,815 Cash $ 684 $ 493 Equity $ 18,283 $ 17,159 Calculation: Total debt $ 6,896 $ 4,815 Minus cash 684 493 Total debt minus cash 6,212 4,322 Total debt 6,896 4,815 Plus equity 18,283 17,159 Minus cash 684 493 Total debt plus equity minus cash $ 24,495 $ 21,481 Cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio 25 % 20 % Capital Requirements Capital Spending Our approved capital, investment and exploration budget for 2013 is $5,183 million. Additional details related to the 2013 budget are discussed in Outlook. Other Expected Cash Outflows We plan to make contributions of up to $64 million to our funded pension plans during 2013 . As of December 31, 2012 , $200 million of commercial paper and $184 million of our long-term debt is due in the next twelve months. Dividends of $0.68 per common share or $480 million were paid during 2012 reflecting quarterly dividends of $0.17 per share. On January 25, 2013 , we announced that our Board of Directors had declared a dividend of $0.17 cents per share on Marathon Oil common stock, payable March 11, 2013 , to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2013 . Share Repurchase Program Since January 2006, our Board of Directors has authorized a common share repurchase program totaling $5 billion. As of December 31, 2012 , we had repurchased 78 million common shares at a cost of $3,222 million, with 66 million shares purchased for $2,922 million prior to the spin-off of our downstream business and 12 million shares acquired at a cost of $300 million in the third quarter of 2011. Purchases under the program may be in either open market transactions, including block purchases, or in privately negotiated transactions. This program may be changed based upon our financial condition or changes in market conditions and is subject to termination prior to completion. The program authorization does not include specific price targets or timetables. The timing of purchases under the program will be influenced by cash generated from operations, proceeds from potential asset sales, cash from available borrowings and market conditions. Our opinions concerning liquidity and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. Factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance (as measured by various factors including cash provided from operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies. The discussion of liquidity above also contains forward-looking statements regarding expected capital, investment and exploration spending and planned funding of our pension plans. The forward-looking statements about our capital, investment and exploration budget are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. The forward-looking statements about our common share repurchase program are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future 48 performance. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include prices of and demand for liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and synthetic crude oil, actions of competitors, disruptions or interruptions of our production or oil sands mining and bitumen upgrading operations due to the shortage of skilled labor and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other operating and economic considerations. Contractual Cash Obligations The table below provides aggregated information on our consolidated obligations to make future payments under existing contracts as of December 31, 2012 . (In millions) Total 2013 2014- 2015 2016- 2017 Later Years Short and long-term debt (excludes interest) (a) $ 6,853 $ 384 $ 1,141 $ 688 $ 4,640 Lease obligations 237 43 71 52 71 Purchase obligations: Oil and gas activities (b) 993 539 342 47 65 Service and materials contracts (c) 1,139 218 229 174 518 Transportation and related contracts 1,427 210 318 231 668 Drilling rigs and fracturing crews 1,417 709 488 220 Other 216 66 80 26 44 Total purchase obligations 5,192 1,742 1,457 698 1,295 Other long-term liabilities reported in the consolidated balance sheet (d) 1,131 122 241 162 606 Total contractual cash obligations (e) $ 13,413 $ 2,291 $ 2,910 $ 1,600 $ 6,612 (a) We anticipate cash payments for interest of $310 million for 2013, $602 million for 2014-2015, $586 million for 2016-2017 and $2,835 million for the remaining years for a total of $4,333 million. (b) Oil and gas activities include contracts to acquire property, plant and equipment and commitments for oil and gas exploration such as costs related to contractually obligated exploratory work programs that are expensed immediately. (c) Service and materials contracts include contracts to purchase services such as utilities, supplies and various other maintenance and operating services. (d) Primarily includes obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits including medical and life insurance. We have estimated projected funding requirements through 2022. Also includes amounts for uncertain tax positions. (e) This table does not include the estimated discounted liability for dismantlement, abandonment and restoration costs of oil and gas properties of $1,783 million. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements. Transactions with Related Parties We own a 63 percent working interest in the Alba field offshore E.G. Onshore E.G., we own a 52 percent interest in an LPG processing plant, a 60 percent interest in an LNG production facility and a 45 percent interest in a methanol production plant, each through equity method investees. We sell our natural gas from the Alba field to these equity method investees as the feedstock for their production processes. The methanol that is produced is then sold through another equity method investee. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Off-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Although off-balance sheet arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes, we are not dependent on these arrangements to maintain our liquidity and capital resources, and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the off-balance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources. We will issue stand alone letters of credit when required by a business partner. Such letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 aggregated $139 million, $231 million, and $439 million. Most of the letters of credit are in support of obligations recorded in the consolidated balance sheet. For example, they are issued to counterparties to insure our payments for outstanding company debt, future abandonment liabilities and prior to June 30, 2011, crude purchases by our downstream business which we spun-off on that date. The decline in the level of our outstanding letters of credit in 2011 is primarily related to the spin-off of our downstream business. 49 Outlook Our Board of Directors approved a capital, investment and exploration budget of $5,183 million for 2013 , including budgeted capital expenditures of $5,003 million. Our focus in 2013 continues to be our U.S. liquids-rich growth assets, with about one-third of our overall budget allocated to the Eagle Ford shale play in south Texas. Further detail of our budget by segment and asset lifecycle is presented below. For additional information about expected exploration and development activities on specific assets see Item 1. Business. Exploration and Production Our worldwide E&P budget for 2013 is $4,740 million. Our E&P strategy is based on three key elements: a solid portfolio of base assets that generates significant cash flow, a defined set of growth assets that provides low risk profitable growth and a balanced exploration program targeting significant value creation. Almost three-fourths, or $3,418 million of the budget is allocated to our growth assets. Of that, $1,940 million is allocated to the Eagle Ford shale play, including planned drilling of 275 - 320 gross (215 - 250 net) operated wells and $190 million for central batteries and pipeline construction. Additionally, we plan to spend nearly $800 million in the Bakken shale in North Dakota and $150 million in the Oklahoma Resource Basins. We plan to drill 190 - 220 gross (65 - 70 net) wells in the Bakken shale and 42 - 50 gross (15 - 19 net) wells in the Oklahoma Resource Basins. Approximately $540 million of our 2013 budget is allocated to other development activities, such as Angola Blocks 31 and 32, the Kurdistan Region of Iraq and Canadian in-situ development. We plan to spend $872 million on our base E&P assets to provide stable production, income and cash flow. These assets include production operations in Norway, the Gulf of Mexico, U.S. conventional oil and gas plays, E.G., the U.K. and Libya. We will continue to stress a disciplined investment plan and maintain a competitive cost structure, with a continued emphasis on high operational availability, for our base assets. Our 2013 budget includes $450 million for selective investment in a balanced exploration program. Planned activity will include conducting seismic surveys in Ethiopia, Gabon, Kenya, the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, Norway and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. We plan to drill 10 - 13 gross (3 - 5 net) wells on these prospects and expect to operate three to four of the gross wells. The above discussion includes forward-looking statements with respect to anticipated future exploratory and development drilling activity, investments in new and existing resource plays, central batteries and pipeline construction projects, and potential development projects. Some factors which could potentially affect these forward-looking statements include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, drilling rig availability, availability of materials and labor, other risks associated with construction projects, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. The foregoing forward-looking statements may be further affected by the inability to obtain or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals or permits. The development projects could further be affected by presently known data concerning size and character of reservoirs, economic recoverability, future drilling success and production experience. The foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Oil Sands Mining The OSM segment budget for 2013 is $262 million. The 2013 budget includes funds for debottlenecking projects, Quest CCS and other capital expenditures. Corporate and Other The remaining $180 million of our 2013 budget is approximately two-thirds capitalized interest on ongoing projects and one-third other corporate activities. Additionally, $1 million is budgeted for our IG segment. Transactions Excluded from our budget are the impacts of our acquisitions and dispositions. We continually evaluate ways to optimize our portfolio for profitable growth through acquisitions and dispositions, with a previously stated goal of divesting between $1.5 billion and $3 billion over the period of 2011 through 2013. For the two-year period ended December 31, 2012 , we entered into agreements for approximately $1.3 billion in divestitures, of which $785 million were completed. The remaining $545 million of asset sales were completed by February 22, 2013 . Additionally, we have engaged in discussions with respect to a potential sale of a portion of our 20 percent interest in the AOSP. Given the uncertainty of such a transaction, potential proceeds have not been included in our previously stated divestiture goal. 50 The forward-looking statements about our capital, investment and exploration budget and the goal of divesting between $1.5 and $3 billion of assets over the period of 2011 through 2013 are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include prices of and demand for crude oil and natural gas, actions of competitors, disruptions or interruptions of our production or bitumen mining and upgrading operations due to the shortage of skilled labor and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other operating and economic considerations. The above discussion also contains forward-looking statements with regard to discussions with respect to a potential sale of a portion of our 20 percent interest in the AOSP. The potential sale of a portion of our interest in the AOSP is subject to successful negotiations and execution of definitive agreements. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict. The foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Management Discussion and Analysis of Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies We have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, and production processes. Legislation and regulations pertaining to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions have the potential to materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including costs of compliance and permitting delays. The extent and magnitude of these adverse impacts cannot be reliably or accurately estimated at this time because specific regulatory and legislative requirements have not been finalized and uncertainty exists with respect to the measures being considered, the costs and the time frames for compliance, and our ability to pass compliance costs on to our customers. For additional information see Item 1A. Risk Factors. We accrue for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated. As environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise, charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required. For additional information see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements. New or expanded environmental requirements, which could increase our environmental costs, may arise in the future. We comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment, but since not all costs are fixed or presently determinable (even under existing legislation) and may be affected by future legislation or regulations, it is not possible to predict all of the ultimate costs of compliance, including remediation costs that may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed. For more information on environmental regulations that impact us, or could impact us, see Item 1. Business Environmental, Health and Safety Matters, Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Item 1A. Risk Factors. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods. Accounting estimates are considered to be critical if (1) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and (2) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. 51 Estimated Quantities of Net Reserves The estimation of quantities of net reserves is a highly technical process performed by our engineers for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas, and by outside consultants for synthetic crude oil, which is based upon several underlying assumptions that are subject to change. Estimates of reserves may change, either positively or negatively, as additional information becomes available and as contractual, operational, economic and political conditions change. We evaluate our reserves using drilling results, reservoir performance, seismic interpretation and future plans to develop acreage. The data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. Consequently, material revisions (upward or downward) to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. Reserve estimates are based upon an unweighted average of commodity prices in the prior 12-month period, using the closing prices on the first day of each month. These prices are not indicative of future market conditions. For a discussion of our reserve estimation process, including the use of third-party audits, see Item 1. Business. We use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities. The successful efforts method inherently relies on the estimation of proved liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves. The existence and the estimated amount of reserves affect, among other things, whether certain costs are capitalized or expensed, the amount and timing of costs depreciated, depleted or amortized into net income and the presentation of supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities. Additionally, both the expected future cash flows to be generated by oil and gas producing properties used in testing such properties for impairment and the expected future taxable income available to realize deferred tax assets also rely, in part, on estimates of quantities of net reserves. Depreciation and depletion of liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil producing properties is determined by the units-of-production method and could change with revisions to estimated proved reserves. Over the past three years, the impact on our depreciation and depletion rate due to revisions of previous reserve estimates has not been significant to either our E&P or our OSM segments. For our E&P segment, on average, a five percent increase in the amount of proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves would lower the depreciation and depletion rate by approximately $0.67 per boe, which would increase pretax income by approximately $106 million annually, based on 2012 production. Conversely, on average, a five percent decrease in the amount of proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves would increase the depreciation and depletion rate by approximately $0.74 per boe and would result in a decrease in pretax income of approximately $117 million annually, based on 2012 production. For our OSM segment, on average, a five percent increase in estimated proved synthetic crude oil reserves would lower the depreciation and depletion rate by approximately $0.86 per barrel and would result in an increase in pretax income of approximately $13 million annually, based on 2012 production. On average, a five percent decrease in estimated proved synthetic crude oil reserves would increase the depreciation and depletion rate by approximately $0.38 per barrel and would result in a decrease in pretax income of approximately $6 million annually, based on 2012 production. Fair Value Estimates Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. There are three approaches for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities: the market approach, the income approach and the cost approach, each of which includes multiple valuation techniques. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach uses valuation techniques to measure fair value by converting future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, into a single present value amount using current market expectations about those future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace the service capacity of an asset. This is often referred to as current replacement cost. The cost approach assumes that the fair value would not exceed what it would cost a market participant to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility, adjusted for obsolescence. The fair value accounting standards do not prescribe which valuation technique should be used when measuring fair value and does not prioritize among the techniques. These standards establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in applying the various valuation techniques. Inputs broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make pricing decisions, including assumptions about risk. Level 1 inputs are given the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy while Level 3 inputs are given the lowest priority. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: Level 1 Observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets as of the measurement date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 2 Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. These are inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date. 52 Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data and may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management best estimate of fair value. Valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs are favored. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest priority level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities within the levels of the fair value hierarchy. We use a market or income approach for recurring fair value measurements and endeavor to use the best information available. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures regarding our fair value measurements. Significant uses of fair value measurements include: impairment assessments of long-lived assets; impairment assessments of goodwill; allocation of the purchase price paid to acquire businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed; and recorded value of derivative instruments. Impairment Assessments of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill The need to test long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment can be based on several indicators, including a significant reduction in prices of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas or synthetic crude oil, unfavorable adjustments to reserves, significant changes in the expected timing of production, other changes to contracts or changes in the regulatory environment in which the property is located. Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. For purposes of impairment evaluation, long-lived assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified, which generally is field-by-field for E&P assets and at the project level for OSM assets. If the sum of the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of an asset group, the carrying value is written down to the estimated fair value. Unlike long-lived assets, goodwill must be tested for impairment at least annually, or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. Fair value calculated for the purpose of testing our long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment is estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method and comparative market prices when appropriate. Significant judgment is involved in performing these fair value estimates since the results are based on forecasted assumptions. Significant assumptions include: Future liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil prices. Our estimates of future prices are based on our analysis of market supply and demand and consideration of market price indicators. Although these commodity prices may experience extreme volatility in any given year, we believe long-term industry prices are driven by global market supply and demand. To estimate supply, we consider numerous factors, including the worldwide resource base, depletion rates, and OPEC production policies. We believe demand is largely driven by global economic factors, such as population and income growth, governmental policies, and vehicle stocks. The prices we use in our fair value estimates are consistent with those used in our planning and capital investment reviews. There has been significant volatility in liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil prices and estimates of such future prices are inherently imprecise. Estimated quantities of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and synthetic crude oil. Such quantities are based on a combination of proved and probable reserves such that the combined volumes represent the most likely expectation of recovery. By definition, probable reserve estimates are less precise than proved reserve estimates. Expected timing of production. Production forecasts are the outcome of engineer studies which estimate proved and probable reserves. The actual timing of the production could be different than the projection. Cash flows realized later in the projection period are less valuable than those realized earlier due to the time value of money. The expected timing of production that we use in our fair value estimates is consistent with that used in our planning and capital investment reviews. Discount rate commensurate with the risks involved . We apply a discount rate to our expected cash flows based on a variety of factors, including market and economic conditions, operational risk, regulatory risk and political risk. This discount rate is also compared to recent observable market transactions, if possible. A higher discount rate decreases the net present value of cash flows. 53 Future capital requirements. Our estimates of future capital requirements are based on authorized spending and internal forecasts. We base our fair value estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonable. However, actual results may differ from these projections. An estimate of the sensitivity to net income resulting from impairment calculations is not practicable, given the numerous assumptions (e.g. reserves, pricing and discount rates) that can materially affect our estimates. That is, unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions may be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions. Acquisitions In accounting for business combinations, the purchase price paid to acquire a business is allocated to its assets and liabilities based on the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. A significant amount of judgment is involved in estimating the individual fair values of property, plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets. The most significant assumptions relate to the estimated fair values allocated to proved and unproved liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil properties. Estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired can have a significant effect on our results of operations in the future. We use all available information to make these fair value determinations and, for certain acquisitions, engage third-party consultants for assistance. During 2011 and 2012, we completed several business combinations in the Eagle Ford shale that were allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements). The fair values used to allocate the purchase price of an acquisition are often estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method, which requires us to estimate reserves as described above under Estimated Quantities of Net Reserves, project related future cash inflows and outflows and apply an appropriate discount rate. The estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain. Accordingly, actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value. Derivatives We record all derivative instruments at fair value. Fair value estimates for all our derivative instruments are based on observable market-based inputs that are corroborated by market data and are discussed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. Additional information about derivatives and their valuation may be found in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in numerous taxing jurisdictions worldwide. Estimates of income taxes to be recorded involve interpretation of complex tax laws and assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our U.S. federal income taxes. We have recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between book basis and tax basis, tax credit carryforwards and operating loss carryforwards. We routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In assessing the need for additional or adjustments to existing valuation allowances, we consider the preponderance of evidence concerning the realization of the deferred tax asset. We must consider any prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that might minimize the amount of deferred tax liabilities recognized or the amount of any valuation allowance recognized against deferred tax assets, if we can implement the strategies and we expect to implement them in the event the forecasted conditions actually occur. Assumptions related to the permanent reinvestment of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are reconsidered quarterly to give effect to changes in our portfolio of producing properties and in our tax profile. Our net deferred tax assets, after valuation allowances, are expected to be realized through our future taxable income and the reversal of temporary differences. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the estimation of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil prices) and the assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our U.S. federal income taxes. The estimates and assumptions used in determining future taxable income are consistent with those used in our planning and capital investment reviews. We consider proved and, in some cases, probable and possible reserves related to our existing producing properties, as well as estimated quantities of liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil related to undeveloped discoveries if, in our judgment, it is likely that development plans will be approved in the foreseeable future. Assumptions regarding our ability to realize the U.S. federal benefit of foreign tax credits are based on certain estimates concerning future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil prices), future financial conditions, income generated from foreign sources and our tax profile in the year that such credits may be claimed. 54 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations Accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the following: the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; the expected long-term return on plan assets; the rate of future increases in compensation levels; and health care cost projections. We develop our demographics and utilize the work of third-party actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations. We have selected different discount rates for our funded U.S. pension plans and our unfunded U.S. retiree health care plans due to the different projected benefit payment patterns. In determining the assumed discount rates, our methods include a review of market yields on high-quality corporate debt and use of our third-party actuary's discount rate model. This model calculates an equivalent single discount rate for the projected benefit plan cash flows using a yield curve derived from AA bond yields. The yield curve represents a series of annualized individual spot discount rates from 0.5 to 99 years. The bonds used are rated AA or higher by a recognized rating agency, only non-callable bonds are included and outlier bonds (bonds that have a yield to maturity that significantly deviates from the average yield within each maturity grouping) are removed. Each issue is required to have at least $250 million par value outstanding. The constructed yield curve is based on those bonds representing the 50 percent highest yielding issuance within each defined maturity group. Of the assumptions used to measure the yearend obligations and estimated annual net periodic benefit cost, the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit cost reported for the plans. Decreasing the discount rates of 3.44 percent for our U.S. pension plans and 4.06 percent for our other U.S. postretirement benefit plans by 0.25 would increase pension obligations and other postretirement benefit plan obligations by $52 million and $9 million and would increase annual defined benefit pension expense by $5 million and would not have a significant impact on other postretirement benefit plan expense. The asset rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plans (currently targeted at approximately 65 percent equity and high yield bonds and 35 percent other fixed income securities for the U.S. funded pension plans and 70 percent equity securities and 30 percent fixed income securities for the international funded pension plans), past performance and other factors. Certain components of the asset mix are modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation, debt returns and stock yields. Our long-term asset rate of return assumption is compared to those of other companies and to our historical returns for reasonableness. Decreasing the 7.25 percent asset rate of return assumption by 0.25 would not have a significant impact on our defined benefit pension expense. Compensation change assumptions are based on historical experience, anticipated future management actions and demographics of the benefit plans. Health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements includes detailed information about the assumptions used to calculate the components of our annual defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan expense, as well as the obligations and accumulated other comprehensive income reported on the balance sheets. Contingent Liabilities We accrue contingent liabilities for environmental remediation, tax deficiencies related to operating taxes, and litigation claims when such contingencies are probable and estimable. Actual costs can differ from estimates for many reasons. For instance, settlement costs for claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on responsibility and assessments of the amount of damages. Similarly, liabilities for environmental remediation may vary from estimates because of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation; additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination; and improvements in technology. Our in-house legal counsel regularly assesses these contingent liabilities. In certain circumstances, outside legal counsel is utilized. We generally record losses related to these types of contingencies as cost of revenues or general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income, except for tax contingencies unrelated to income taxes, which are recorded as other taxes. For additional information on contingent liabilities, see Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Management Discussion and Analysis of Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies. An estimate of the sensitivity to net income if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practical because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, in terms of both the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss. 55 Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted In February 2013, an accounting standards update was issued to improve the reporting of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income. This standard requires an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component. In addition, an entity is required to present, either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period. For other amounts that are not required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified in their entirety to net income, an entity is required to cross-reference to other disclosures required under U.S. GAAP that provide additional detail about those amounts. These disclosures are effective for us beginning the first quarter of 2013. Adoption of this amendment will not have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In December 2011 an accounting standards update designed to enhance disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities was issued. Further clarification limiting the scope of these disclosures to derivatives, repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and securities lending transactions was issued in January 2013. The disclosures are intended to enable financial statement users to evaluate the effect or potential effect of netting arrangements on an entity financial position. Entities are required to disclose both gross information and net information about in-scope financial instruments that are either offset in the statement of financial position or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement, irrespective of whether they are offset. These disclosures are effective for us beginning the first quarter of 2013 and must be made retrospectively for comparable periods. Adoption of this amendment will not have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 56
