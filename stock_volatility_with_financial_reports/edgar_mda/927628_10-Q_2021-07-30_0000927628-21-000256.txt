INTRODUCTION Capital One Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation established in 1994 and headquartered in McLean, Virginia, is a diversified financial services holding company with banking and non-banking subsidiaries. Capital One Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company ) offer a broad array of financial products and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients through digital channels, branches, Caf and other distribution channels. As of June 30, 2021, our principal subsidiaries included: Capital One Bank (USA), National Association ( COBNA ), which offers credit and debit card products, other lending products and deposit products; and Capital One, National Association ( CONA ), which offers a broad spectrum of banking products and financial services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients. The Company is hereafter collectively referred to as we, us or our. COBNA and CONA are collectively referred to as the Banks. Certain business terms used in this document are defined in the MD&A Glossary and Acronyms and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in this Report. Our consolidated total net revenues are derived primarily from lending to consumer, small business and commercial customers net of funding costs associated with interest on deposits, long-term debt and other borrowings. We also earn non-interest income which primarily consists of interchange income, net of reward expenses, service charges and other customer-related fees. Our expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating expenses, marketing expenses and income taxes. Our principal operations are organized for management reporting purposes into three major business segments, which are defined primarily based on the products and services provided or the types of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into or managed as a part of our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio, asset/liability management by our centralized Corporate Treasury group and residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate that is not assessed to our primary business segments, are included in the Other category. Credit Card: Consists of our domestic consumer and small business card lending, and international card businesses in Canada and the United Kingdom ( U.K. ). 4 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Consumer Banking: Consists of our deposit gathering and lending activities for consumers and small businesses, and national auto lending. Commercial Banking: Consists of our lending, deposit gathering, capital markets and treasury management services to commercial real estate and commercial and industrial customers. Our commercial and industrial customers typically include companies with annual revenues between $20 million and $2 billion. Business Developments We regularly explore and evaluate opportunities to acquire financial services and products as well as financial assets, including credit card and other loan portfolios, and enter into strategic partnerships as part of our growth strategy. We also explore opportunities to acquire technology companies and related assets to improve our information technology infrastructure and to deliver on our digital strategy. We may issue equity or debt to fund our acquisitions. In addition, we regularly consider the potential disposition of certain assets, branches, partnership agreements or lines of business. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a global public-health crisis, disrupting economies and introducing significant volatility into financial markets. We transformed how we work in order to protect the well-being of our associates and our customers, and were able to continue to serve our customers, successfully manage critical functions, and keep our lines of business operating. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant majority of our associates across our workforce have transitioned to working remotely, relying on our technology infrastructure and systems that have been designed for resilience and security. The majority of our associates will continue to work remotely through the summer of 2021. Our current plan is to adopt a hybrid work methodology on September 7, 2021 that allows for in-office collaboration while still enabling associates to work remotely. We continue to monitor local conditions to ensure the safety of our associates. For more information see Part I Item 1. Business Overview Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic and Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2020 Form 10-K along with Part I Item 2. MD&A Introduction Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic and Part I Item 2. MD&A Credit Risk Profile COVID-19 Customer Assistance Programs and Loan Modifications in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2021. 5 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA The following table presents selected consolidated financial data and performance from our results of operations for the second quarter and first six months of 2021 and 2020 and selected comparative balance sheet data as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. We also provide selected key metrics we use in evaluating our performance, including certain metrics that are computed using non-GAAP measures. We consider these metrics to be key financial measures that management uses in assessing our operating performance, capital adequacy and the level of returns generated. We believe these non-GAAP metrics provide useful insight to investors and users of our financial information as they provide an alternate measurement of our performance and assist in assessing our capital adequacy and the level of return generated.

In comparison, we reported net loss of $918 million ($2.21 per diluted common share) on total net revenue of $6.6 billion and net loss of $2.3 billion ($5.31 per diluted common share) on total net revenue of $13.8 billion for the second quarter and first six months of 2020. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio as calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach was 14.5% and 13.7% as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. See MD&A Capital Management for additional information. On January 25, 2021, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $7.5 billion of shares of our common stock. We repurchased approximately $1.7 billion of shares of our common stock during the second quarter of 2021 and $2.2 billion during the first six months of 2021, consistent with the Federal Reserve temporary capital distribution restrictions in place during the first six months of 2021. See MD&A Capital Management Dividend Policy and Stock Purchases for additional information. Below are additional highlights of our performance in the second quarter and first six months of 2021. These highlights are based on a comparison between the results of the second quarter and first six months of 2021 and 2020, except as otherwise noted. The changes in our financial condition and credit performance are generally based on our financial condition and credit performance as of June 30, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020. We provide a more detailed discussion of our financial performance in the sections following this Executive Summary and Business Outlook. Total Company Performance Earnings: Our net income increased by $4.5 billion to $3.5 billion in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020 and increased by $9.1 billion to $6.9 billion in the first six months of 2021 compared to the first six months of 2020 primarily driven by: lower provision resulting from allowance releases in the first and second quarters of 2021 due to continued strong credit performance and an improved economic outlook compared to allowance builds in the first and second quarters of 2020 driven by expectations of economic worsening at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic; higher non-interest income from interchange fees due to an increase in purchase volume in Domestic Card; and higher net interest income due to lower interest rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and higher average outstanding balances in our auto loan portfolio, partially offset by lower average outstanding balances in our domestic card loan portfolio. Loans Held for Investment : Period-end loans held for investment decreased by $2.0 billion to $249.6 billion as of June 30, 2021 from December 31, 2020 primarily due to higher customer payments and the transfer of $4.1 billion in loans to held for sale, partially offset by growth in our auto loan portfolio. Average loans held for investment decreased by $6.9 billion to $246.5 billion in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020 and decreased by $12.9 billion to $245.2 billion in the first six months of 2021 compared to the first six months of 2020 primarily driven by lower outstanding balances in Domestic Card due to higher customer payments, partially offset by higher purchase volume and growth in our auto loan portfolio. Net Charge-Off and Delinquency Metrics: Our net charge-off rate decreased by 150 basis points to 0.88% in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020 and decreased by 151 basis points to 1.04% in the first six months of 2021 compared to the first six months of 2020, primarily driven by strong credit performance in our domestic card and auto loan portfolios. 9 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Our 30+ day delinquency rate decreased by 72 basis points to 1.89% as of June 30, 2021 from December 31, 2020 due to seasonally lower delinquency inventories and strong credit performance in our auto and domestic card loan portfolios. Allowance for Credit Losses: Our allowance for credit losses decreased by $3.2 billion to $12.3 billion, and our allowance coverage ratio decreased by 124 basis points to 4.95% as of June 30, 2021 from December 31, 2020, driven by strong credit performance and an improved economic outlook. Business Outlook We discuss in this Report our expectations as of the time this Report was filed regarding our total company performance and the performance of our business segments based on market conditions, the regulatory environment and our business strategies. The statements contained in this Report are based on our current expectations regarding our outlook for our financial results and business strategies. Our expectations take into account, and should be read in conjunction with, our expectations regarding economic trends and analysis of our business as discussed in Part I Item 1. Business and Part II Item 7. MD&A in our 2020 Form 10-K. Certain statements are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results could differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements. Except as otherwise disclosed, forward-looking statements do not reflect: any change in current dividend or repurchase strategies; the effect of any acquisitions, divestitures or similar transactions that have not been previously disclosed; or any changes in laws, regulations or regulatory interpretations, in each case after the date as of which such statements are made. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic ultimately impacts our business, results of operations, and financial condition will depend on future developments that are still uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. See MD&A Forward-Looking Statements in this Report for more information on the forward-looking statements and Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2020 Form 10-K for factors that could materially influence our results. Business Segment Expectations We expect that the auto net charge-off rate will increase from the unusually low level observed in the second quarter of 2021. 10 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The section below provides a comparative discussion of our consolidated financial performance for the second quarter and first six months of 2021 and 2020. We provide a discussion of our business segment results in the following section, MD&A Business Segment Financial Performance. This section should be read together with our MD&A Executive Summary and Business Outlook, where we discuss trends and other factors that we expect will affect our future results of operations. Net Interest Income Net interest income represents the difference between interest income, including certain fees, earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense incurred on our interest-bearing liabilities. Our interest-earning assets include loans, investment securities and other interest-earning assets, while our interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing deposits, securitized debt obligations, senior and subordinated notes, other borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. Generally, we include in interest income any past due fees on loans that we deem collectible. Our net interest margin, based on our consolidated results, represents the difference between the yield on our interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities, including the notional impact of non-interest-bearing funding. We expect net interest income and our net interest margin to fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 11 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 2 below presents the average outstanding balance, interest income earned, interest expense incurred and average yield for the second quarter and first six months of 2021 and 2020 for each major category of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.

(2) Some of our commercial loans generate tax-exempt income. Accordingly, we present our Commercial Banking interest income and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated using the federal statutory rate of 21% and state taxes where applicable, with offsetting reductions to the Other category. Taxable-equivalent adjustments included in the interest income and yield computations for our commercial loans totaled approximately $19 million and $38 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2021, respectively, and $21 million and $41 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2020, respectively, with corresponding reductions to the Other category. (3) Interest income/expense in the Other category represents the impact of hedge accounting on our loan portfolios and the offsetting reduction of the taxable-equivalent adjustments of our commercial loans as described above. ** Not meaningful. Net interest income increased by $283 million to $5.7 billion in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020, and increased by $80 million to $11.6 billion in the first six months of 2021 compared to the first six months of 2020 primarily driven by lower interest rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and higher average outstanding balances in our auto loan portfolio, partially offset by lower average outstanding balances in our domestic card loan portfolio. 13 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Net interest margin increased by 11 basis points to 5.89% in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020 driven by lower interest rate paid on interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by higher balances and lower yield on investment securities. Net interest margin decreased by 32 basis points to 5.94% in the first six months of 2021 compared to the first six months of 2020 primarily driven by a shift in our asset mix with cash and investment securities representing a greater portion of total average interest-earnings assets, partially offset by lower rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Table 3 displays the change in our net interest income between periods and the extent to which the variance is attributable to: changes in the volume of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities; or changes in the interest rates related to these assets and liabilities.

The portion of interest income or interest expense attributable to both volume and rate is allocated proportionately when the calculation results in a positive value. When the portion of interest income or interest expense attributable to both volume and rate results in a negative value, the total amount is allocated to volume or rate, depending on which amount is positive. (2) Some of our commercial loans generate tax-exempt income. Accordingly, we present our Commercial Banking interest income and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated using the federal statutory rate of 21% and state taxes where applicable, with offsetting reductions to the Other category.

These amounts have corresponding offsets in other non-interest expense. No n-interest income increased by $535 million to $1.6 billion in the the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020 and increased by $602 million to $2.9 billion in the first six months of 2021 compared to the first six months of 2020 primarily driven by higher net interchange fees due to an increase in purchase volume in Domestic Card. Provision for Credit Losses Our provision for credit losses in each period is driven by net charge-offs, changes to the allowance for credit losses and changes to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. Our provision for credit loss es decreased by $5.4 billion to a benefit of $1.2 billion i n the second quarter of 2021 and decreased by $11.7 billion to a benefit of $2.0 billion in the first six months of 2021. These decreases were primarily driven by allowance releases in the first and second quarters of 2021 due to continued strong credit performance and an improved economic outlook compared to allowance builds in the first and second quarters of 2020 driven by expectations of economic worsening at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. We provide additional information on the provision for credit losses and changes in the allowance for credit losses within MD&A Credit Risk Profile and Note 4 Allowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments. For information on the allowance methodology for each of our loan categories, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our 2020 Form 10-K. 15 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Non-Interest Expense Table 5 displays the components of non-interest expense for the second quarter and first six months of 2021 and 2020.

These amounts have corresponding offsets in other non-interest income. (2) Includes legal reserve builds of $55 million for the second quarter and first six months of 2021 and $265 million and $310 million for the second quarter and first six months of 2020, respectively. Non-interest expense increased by $196 million to $4.0 billion in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020 and increased by $207 million to $7.7 billion in the first six months of 2021 compared to the first six months of 2020, primarily driven by increased marketing spend. Income Taxes We recorded an income tax provision of $1.0 billion (22.6% effective income tax rate) and $1.9 billion (21.7% ef fective income tax rate) in the second quarter and first six months of 2021 , respectively, compared to an income tax benefit of $543 million (37.2% effective income tax rate) and $1.1 billion (32.9% effective income tax rate) in the second quarter and first six months of 2020 , respectively. Our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations varies between periods due, in part, to the impact of changes in pre-tax income and changes in tax credits, tax-exempt income and non-deductible expenses relative to our pre-tax earnings. The decrease in our effective income tax rate in the second quarter and first six months of 2021 compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2020 was primarily due to significantly higher positive pre-tax earnings in 2021 compared to pre-tax losses in 2020 driven by expectations of economic worsening that existed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. We provide additional information on items affecting our income taxes and effective tax rate in Note 15 Income Taxes in our 2020 Form 10-K. 16 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS ANALYSIS Total assets increased by $1.8 billion to $423.4 billion as of June 30, 2021 from December 31, 2020 primarily driven by an increase in loan balances, net of higher customer payments, which was partially offset by a decrease in our cash balances due to paydowns of our securitized debt obligations and redemptions of our senior unsecured debt. Total liabilities decreased by $2.6 billion to $358.8 billion as of June 30, 2021 from December 31, 2020 primarily driven by redemptions of our senior unsecured debt and paydowns of our securitization debt obligations, partially offset by growth in deposits driven by increased consumer savings. Stockholders equity increased by $4.4 billion to $64.6 billion as of June 30, 2021 from December 31, 2020 primarily due to our net income of $6.9 billion, partially offset by the repurchase of shares of our common stock. The following is a discussion of material changes in the major components of our assets and liabilities during the first six months of 2021. Period-end balance sheet amounts may vary from average balance sheet amounts due to liquidity and balance sheet management activities that are intended to support the adequacy of capital while managing our liquidity requirements, our customers and our market risk exposure in accordance with our risk appetite. Investment Securities Our investment securities portfolio consists of the following: U.S. government-sponsored enterprise or agency ( Agency ) and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities ( RMBS ), Agency commercial mortgage-backed securities ( CMBS ), U.S. Treasury securities and other securities. Agency securities include Government National Mortgage Association ( Ginnie Mae ) guaranteed securities, Federal National Mortgage Association ( Fannie Mae ) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( Freddie Mac ) issued securities. The carrying value of our investments in Agency and U.S. Treasury securities represented 96% of our total investment securities portfolio as of both June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio increased by $1.3 billion to $101.8 billion as of June 30, 2021 from December 31, 2020, primarily driven by net purchases, partially offset by the increase in interest rates. See Note 2 Investment Securities for more information. Table 6 presents the amortized cost and fair value for the major security types in our available for sale securities portfolio as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

We provide additional information on the composition of our loan portfolio and credit quality in MD&A Credit Risk Profile, MD&A Consolidated Results of Operations and Note 3 Loans. Funding Sources Our primary source of funding comes from deposits, as they are a stable and relatively low cost source of funding. In addition to deposits, we raise funding through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, securitized debt obligations, federal funds purchased, securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, and Federal Home Loan Banks ( FHLB ) advances secured by certain portions of our loan and securities portfolios. Table 8 provides the composition of our primary sources of funding as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

Total deposits increased by $866 million to $306.3 billion as of June 30, 2021 from December 31, 2020 primarily driven by increased consumer savings, as well as commercial clients holding elevated levels of liquidity. Securitized debt obligations decreased by $1.9 billion to $10.6 billion as of June 30, 2021 from December 31, 2020 primarily driven by maturities and paydowns in our securitizations. Other debt decreased by $2.3 billion to $25.8 billion as of June 30, 2021 from December 31, 2020 prim arily driven by redemptions of our senior unsecured debt. We provide additional information on our funding sources in MD&A Liquidity Risk Profile and Note 7 Deposits and Borrowings. 18 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS In the ordinary course of business, we engage in certain activities that are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets, generally referred to as off-balance sheet arrangements. These activities typically involve transactions with unconsolidated variable interest entities ( VIEs ) as well as other arrangements, such as letters of credit, loan commitments and guarantees, to meet the financing needs of our customers and support their ongoing operations. We provide additional information regarding these types of activities in Note 5 Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations and Note 13 Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others. BUSINESS SEGMENT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE Our principal operations are organized for management reporting purposes into three major business segments, which are defined primarily based on the products and services provided or the types of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into or managed as a part of our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio, asset/liability management by our centralized Corporate Treasury group and calculation of our residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate that is not assessed to our primary business segments, are included in the Other category. The results of our individual businesses, which we report on a continuing operations basis, reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources. We may periodically change our business segments or reclassify business segment results based on modifications to our management reporting methodologies and changes in organizational alignment. Our business segment results are intended to reflect each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. We use an internal management and reporting process to derive our business segment results. Our internal management and reporting process employs various allocation methodologies, including funds transfer pricing, to assign certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses directly or indirectly attributable to each business segment. Total interest income and non-interest income are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported. The net interest income of each segment reflects the results of our funds transfer pricing process, which is primarily based on a matched funding concept that takes into consideration market interest rates. Our funds transfer pricing process provides a funds credit for sources of funds, such as deposits generated by our Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking businesses, and a charge for the use of funds by each segment. The allocation process is unique to each business segment and acquired business. We regularly assess the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, which may result in the implementation of refinements or changes in future periods. We provide additional information on the allocation methodologies used to derive our business segment results in Note 17 Business Segments and Revenue from Contracts with Customers in our 2020 Form 10-K. We refer to the business segment results derived from our internal management accounting and reporting process as our managed presentation, which differs in some cases from our reported results prepared based on U.S. GAAP. There is no comprehensive authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to U.S. GAAP; therefore, the managed presentation of our business segment results may not be comparable to similar information provided by other financial services companies. In addition, our individual business segment results should not be used as a substitute for comparable results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We summarize our business segment results for the second quarter and first six months of 2021 and 2020 and provide a comparative discussion of these results, as well as changes in our financial condition and credit performance metrics as of June 30, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020. We provide a reconciliation of our total business segment results to our reported consolidated results in Note 12 Business Segments and Revenue from Contracts with Customers. 19 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Business Segment Financial Performance Table 9 summarizes our business segment results, which we report based on revenue (loss) and income (loss) from continuing operations, for the second quarter and first six months of 2021 and 2020.

Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income increased by $408 million to $1.3 billion in the second quarter of 2021 and increased by $526 million to $2.3 billion in the first six months of 2021 primarily driven by higher net interchange fees due to an increase in purchase volume. Provision for Credit Losses: Provision for credit losses decreased by $3.6 billion to a benefit of $635 million in the second quarter of 2021 and decreased by $7.8 billion to a benefit of $1.1 billion in the first six months of 2021 resulting from allowance releases in the first and second quarters of 2021 due to continued strong credit performance and an improved economic outlook compared to allowance builds in the first and second quarters of 2020 driven by expectations of economic worsening at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense increased by $294 million to $2.3 billion in the second quarter of 2021 and increased by $221 million to $4.4 billion in the first six months of 2021 primarily driven by increased marketing spend. Loans Held for Investment: Period-end loans held for investment decreased by $5.9 billion to $101.0 billion as of June 30, 2021 from December 31, 2020 primarily due to higher customer payments and the transfer of a $2.6 billion international partnership portfolio to held for sale as of June 30, 2021, partially offset by higher purchase volume in Domestic Card. Average loans held for investment decreased by $9.1 billion to $99.7 billion in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020 and decreased by $15.7 billion to $100.1 billion in the first six months of 2021 compared to the first six months of 2020 primarily due to higher customer payments, partially offset by higher purchase volume in Domestic Card. Net Charge-Off and Delinquency Metrics: The net charge-off rate decreased by 217 basis points to 2.29% in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020 and decreased by 216 basis points to 2.41% in the first six months of 2021 compared to the first six months of 2020 primarily driven by strong credit performance in Domestic Card due to higher customer payments, partially offset by lower average loans held for investment. The 30+ day delinquency rate decreased by 70 basis points to 1.75% as of June 30, 2021 from December 31, 2020 due to seasonally lower delinquency inventories and strong credit performance in our domestic credit card loan portfolio. 22 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Domestic Card Business The Domestic Card business generated net income from continuing operations of $2.0 billion and $4.0 billion in the second quarter and first six months of 2021, respectively, compared to net loss of $605 million and $1.5 billion in the second quarter and first six months of 2020, respectively.

Net income for our Domestic Card business increased in the second quarter of 2021 and in the first six months of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020 and the first six months of 2020 primarily driven by: lower provision for credit losses resulting from allowance releases in the first and second quarters of 2021 due to continued strong credit performance and an improved economic outlook compared to allowance builds in the first and second quarters of 2020 driven by expectations of economic worsening at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic; and higher non-interest income primarily due to higher net interchange fees from an increase in purchase volume. These drivers were partially offset by: higher non-interest expense primarily driven by increased marketing spend; and lower net interest income primarily due to lower average outstanding balances. 24 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Consumer Banking Business The primary sources of revenue for our Consumer Banking business are net interest income from loans and deposits as well as service charges and customer-related fees.

Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income increased by $77 million to $257 million in the second quarter of 2021 and increased by $79 million to $497 million in the first six months of 2021 driven by higher activity in our capital markets business. Provision for Credit Losses: Provision for credit losses decreased by $646 million to a benefit of $219 million in the second quarter of 2021 and decreased by $1.7 billion to a benefit of $422 million in the first six months of 2021 resulting from allowance releases due to an improved economic outlook and improvement in our energy portfolio, compared to allowance builds in the first and second quarter of 2020 driven by expectations of economic worsening at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as credit deterioration in our energy loan portfolio. Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense has remained substantially flat at $417 million in the second quarter of 2021 and $836 million in the first six months of 2021. Loans Held for Investment: Period-end loans held for investment decreased by $2.0 billion to $73.8 billion as of June 30, 2021 from December 31, 2020 primarily driven by higher utilization of credit lines in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the transfer of $1.5 billion in loans to held for sale as of June 30, 2021. Average loans held for investment decreased by $5.7 billion to $74.1 billion in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020 and decreased by $4.0 billion to $74.1 billion in the first six months of 2021 compared to the first six months of 2020 driven by higher utilization of credit lines in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Loss from continuing operations increased by $178 million to a loss of $216 million in the first six months of 2021, primarily driven by the decrease in net interest income (loss) from a decline in market interest rates and reduced funding needs of our business segments, as well as a decrease in income tax benefit due to the relative impact of the tax credits, partially offset by lower legal reserve builds in non-interest expense. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make a number of judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses on the consolidated financial statements. Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We provide a summary of our significant accounting policies under Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our 2020 Form 10-K. We have identified the following accounting estimates as critical because they require significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Our critical accounting policies and estimates are as follows: Loan loss reserves Asset impairment Fair value of financial instruments Customer rewards reserve We evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and update them as necessary, based on changing conditions. There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates described in our December 31, 2020 Form 10-K under MD&A Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. 29 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents ACCOUNTING CHANGES AND DEVELOPMENTS Accounting Standards Issued but Not Adopted as of June 30, 2021 There were no relevant new accounting standards issued but not adopted as of June 30, 2021. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for information on the accounting standards we adopted in 2021. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The level and composition of our capital are determined by multiple factors, including our consolidated regulatory capital requirements as described in more detail below and internal risk-based capital assessments such as internal stress testing and economic capital. The level and composition of our capital may also be influenced by rating agency guidelines, subsidiary capital requirements, business environment, conditions in the financial markets and assessments of potential future losses due to adverse changes in our business and market environments. Capital Standards and Prompt Corrective Action The Company and the Banks are subject to the Basel III Capital Rules established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ( Federal Reserve ) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) respectively (the Basel III Capital Rules ). The Basel III Capital Rules implement certain capital requirements published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ( Basel Committee ), along with certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 ( Dodd-Frank Act ) and other capital provisions. Moreover, the Banks, as insured depository institutions, are subject to prompt corrective action ( PCA ) capital regulations. Basel III and United States Capital Rules Under the Basel III Capital Rules, we must maintain a minimum common equity Tier 1 ( CET1 ) capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, and a total capital ratio of 8.0%, in each case in relation to risk-weighted assets. In addition, we must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0% and a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3.0%. We are also subject to the capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer requirements, as described below. In October 2019, the Federal Reserve, OCC and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC, and collectively, the Federal Banking Agencies ) amended the Basel III Capital Rules to provide for tailored application of certain capital requirements across different categories of banking institutions (the Tailoring Rules ). These categories are determined primarily by an institution asset size, with adjustments to a more stringent category possible if the institution exceeds certain risk-based thresholds. As a bank holding company ( BHC ) with total consolidated assets of at least $250 billion that does not exceed any of the applicable risk-based thresholds, we are a Category III institution under the Tailoring Rules. Therefore, effective January 1, 2020, we are no longer subject to the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework and certain associated capital requirements, and we have elected to exclude certain elements of accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) from our regulatory capital as permitted by the Tailoring Rules. We remain subject to the countercyclical capital buffer requirement (which is currently set at 0%) and supplementary leverage ratio requirement, which were previously required only for Basel III Advanced Approaches institutions. Global systemically important banks ( G-SIBs ) that are based in the U.S. are subject to an additional CET1 capital requirement known as the G-SIB Surcharge. We are not a G-SIB based on the most recent available data and thus we are not subject to a G-SIB Surcharge. Stress Capital Buffer Rule The Basel III Capital Rules require banking institutions to maintain a capital conservation buffer, composed of CET1 capital, above the regulatory minimum ratios. The capital conservation buffer for BHCs was previously fixed at 2.5%. In March 2020, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule to implement the stress capital buffer requirement (the Stress Capital Buffer Rule ). The stress capital buffer requirement is institution-specific and replaces the fixed 2.5% capital conservation buffer for BHCs. Pursuant to the Stress Capital Buffer Rule, the Federal Reserve will use the results of its supervisory stress test to determine the size of a BHC stress capital buffer requirement. In particular, a BHC stress capital buffer requirement will equal, subject to a floor of 2.5%, the sum of (i) the difference between the BHC starting CET1 capital ratio and its lowest projected CET1 capital 30 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents ratio under the severely adverse scenario of the Federal Reserve supervisory stress test plus (ii) the ratio of the BHC projected four quarters of common stock dividends (for the fourth to seventh quarters of the planning horizon) to the projected risk-weighted assets for the quarter in which the BHC projected CET1 capital ratio reaches its minimum under the supervisory stress test. Under the Stress Capital Buffer Rule framework, the Company new standardized approach capital conservation buffer includes its stress capital buffer requirement (which will be recalibrated every year based on the Company supervisory stress test results), any G-SIB surcharge (which is not applicable to us) and the countercyclical capital buffer requirement (which is currently set at 0%). Any determination to increase the countercyclical capital buffer generally would be effective twelve months after the announcement of such an increase, unless the Federal Banking Agencies set an earlier effective date. Based on the Company 2020 supervisory stress testing results, the Company stress capital buffer requirement is 5.6% for the period from October 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021. Therefore, the Company minimum capital requirements plus the standardized approach capital conservation buffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios under the stress capital buffer framework are 10.1%, 11.6% and 13.6%, respectively, for the period from October 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021. Based on the Company 2021 supervisory stress testing results, the Company stress capital buffer requirement for the period beginning on October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022 is 2.5%. Therefore, the Company minimum capital requirements plus the standardized approach capital conservation buffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios under the stress capital buffer framework are 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5%, respectively, for the period from October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022. The Stress Capital Buffer Rule does not apply to the Banks. The capital conservation buffer for the Banks continues to be fixed at 2.5%. Accordingly, each Bank minimum capital requirements plus its capital conservation buffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios remain at 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5% respectively. If we fail to maintain our capital ratios above the minimum capital requirements plus the applicable buffer requirements, we will face increasingly strict automatic limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to certain executive officers. As of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, each of the Company and the Banks exceeded the minimum capital requirements and the buffer requirements applicable to them, and each of the Banks was well capitalized under PCA requirements. Market Risk Rule The Market Risk Rule supplements the Basel III Capital Rules by requiring institutions subject to the rule to adjust their risk-based capital ratios to reflect the market risk in their trading portfolios. The Market Risk Rule generally applies to institutions with aggregate trading assets and liabilities equal to 10% or more of total assets or $1 billion or more. As of June 30, 2021, the Company and CONA are subject to the Market Risk Rule. See MD&A Market Risk Profile below for additional information. CECL Transition Rule The Federal Banking Agencies adopted a final rule (the 2020 CECL Transition Rule ) that provides banking institutions an optional five-year transition period to phase in the impact of the current expected credit loss ( CECL ) standard on their regulatory capital (the 2020 CECL Transition Election ). Pursuant to the 2020 CECL Transition Rule, a banking institution may elect to delay the estimated impact of adopting CECL on its regulatory capital through December 31, 2021 and then phase in the estimated cumulative impact from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. For the day 2 ongoing impact of CECL during the initial two years, the Federal Banking Agencies use a uniform scaling factor of 25% as an approximation of the increase in the allowance under the CECL standard compared to the prior incurred loss methodology. Accordingly, from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021, electing banking institutions are permitted to add back to their regulatory capital an amount equal to the sum of the after-tax day 1 CECL adoption impact and 25% of the increase in the allowance since the adoption of the CECL standard. Beginning January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024, the after-tax day 1 CECL adoption impact and the cumulative day 2 ongoing impact will be phased in to regulatory capital at 25% per year. The following table summarizes the capital impact delay and phase in period on our regulatory capital from years 2020 to 2025. 31 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Capital Impact Delayed Phase In Period 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 Day 1 CECL adoption impact Capital impact delayed to 2022 25% Phased In 50% Phased In 75% Phased In Fully Phased In Cumulative day 2 ongoing impact 25% scaling factor as an approximation of the increase in allowance under CECL We adopted the CECL standard (for accounting purposes) as of January 1, 2020, and made the 2020 CECL Transition Election (for regulatory capital purposes) in the first quarter of 2020. Therefore, the applicable amounts presented in this Report reflect such election.

Capital Planning and Regulatory Stress Testing On June 24, 2021, the Federal Reserve released the results of its supervisory stress tests for the 2021 cycle. Based on the results, all participating BHCs, including the Company, remained above their risk-based minimum capital requirements in the hypothetical stress scenario. Accordingly, as laid out previously by the Federal Reserve, the temporary capital distribution restrictions put in place in the third quarter of 2020 following the outbreak of COVID-19 ended for all participating BHCs, including the Company, after the second quarter of 2021. All participating BHCs, including the Company, remain subject to the normal capital distribution restrictions of the stress capital buffer framework. On January 25, 2021, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $7.5 billion of shares of our common stock. We repurchased approximately $1.7 billion of shares of our common stock during the second quarter of 2021 and $2.2 billion during the first six months of 2021, consistent with the Federal Reserve temporary capital distribution restrictions in place during the first six months of 2021. On July 28, 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a special dividend of $0.60 per share of common stock payable in the third quarter of 2021. In addition to the special dividend, the Board of Directors authorized an increase to our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.40 per share to $0.60 per share beginning with our dividend payable in the third quarter of 2021. For the description of the regulatory capital planning rules we are subject to, see MD&A Supervision and Regulation in this Report as well as Part I Item 1.

As a BHC, our ability to pay dividends is largely dependent upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries. The Banks are subject to regulatory restrictions that limit their ability to transfer funds to our BHC. As of June 30, 2021, funds available for dividend payments from COBNA and CONA were $2.1 billion and $1.5 billion , respectively. There can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends to stockholders. On January 25, 2021, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $7.5 billion of shares of our common stock. We repurchased approximately $1.7 billion of shares of our common stock during the second quarter of 2021 and $2.2 billion during the first six months of 2021, consistent with the Federal Reserve temporary capital distribution restrictions in place during the first six months of 2021. The timing and exact amount of any future common stock repurchases will depend on various factors, including regulatory approval, market conditions, opportunities for growth, our capital position and the amount of retained earnings. Our stock repurchase program does not include specific price targets, may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including utilizing Rule 10b5-1 programs, and may be suspended at any time.

Business Supervision and Regulation Dividends, Stock Repurchases and Transfers of Funds in our 2020 Form 10-K. 35 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents RISK MANAGEMENT Risk Management Framework Our Risk Management Framework (the Framework ) sets consistent expectations for risk management across the Company. It also sets expectations for our Three Lines of Defense model, which defines the roles, responsibilities and accountabilities for taking and managing risk across the Company. Accountability for overseeing an effective Framework resides with our Board of Directors either directly or through its committees. The First Line of Defense consists of any line of business or function that is accountable for risk taking and is responsible for: (i) engaging in activities designed to generate revenue or reduce expenses; (ii) providing operational support or servicing to any business function for the delivery of products or services to customers; or (iii) providing technology services in direct support of first line business areas. Each line of business or first line function is responsible for managing the risks associated with their activities, including identifying, assessing, measuring, monitoring, controlling and reporting the risks within its business activities, consistent with the risk framework. The Second Line of Defense consists of two types of functions: Independent Risk Management ( IRM ) and Support Functions. IRM oversees risk-taking activities and assesses risks and issues independent from the first line of defense. Support Functions are centers of specialized expertise (e.g., Human Resources, Accounting, Legal) that provide support services to the Company. The Third Line of Defense is comprised of the Internal Audit and Credit Review functions. The third line provides independent and objective assurance to senior management and to the Board of Directors that the first and second lines of defense have systems and governance processes which are well-designed and working as intended, and that the Framework is appropriate for our size, complexity and risk profile. Our Framework consists of the following nine elements: Governance and Accountability Strategy and Risk Alignment Risk Identification Assessment, Measurement and Response Monitoring and Testing Aggregation, Reporting and Escalation Capital and Liquidity Management (including Stress Testing) Risk Data and Enabling Technology Culture and Talent Management 36 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents We provide additional discussion of our risk management principles, roles and responsibilities, framework and risk appetite under MD&A Risk Management in our 2020 Form 10-K.

Trends in delinquency rates are the key credit quality indicator for our credit card and retail banking loan portfolios as changes in delinquency rates can provide an early warning of changes in potential future credit losses. The key indicator we monitor when assessing the credit quality and risk of our auto loan portfolio is borrower credit scores as they provide insight into borrower risk profiles, which give indications of potential future credit losses. The key credit quality indicator for our commercial loan portfolios is our internal risk ratings as we generally classify loans that have been delinquent for an extended period of time and other loans with significant risk of loss as nonperforming. In addition to these credit quality indicators, we also manage and monitor other credit quality metrics such as level of nonperforming loans and net charge-off rates. We underwrite most consumer loans using proprietary models, which typically include credit bureau data, such as borrower credit scores, application information and, where applicable, collateral and deal structure data. We continuously adjust our management of credit lines and collection strategies based on customer behavior and risk profile changes. We also use borrower credit scores for subprime classification, for competitive benchmarking and, in some cases, to drive product segmentation decisions. Table 22 provides details on the credit scores of our domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Table 22: Credit Score Distribution (Percentage of portfolio) June 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Domestic credit card Refreshed FICO scores: (1) Greater than 660 72 % 69 % 660 or below 28 31 Total 100 % 100 % Auto At origination FICO scores: (2) Greater than 660 48 % 46 % 621 - 660 20 20 620 or below 32 34 Total 100 % 100 % __________ (1) Percentages represent period-end loans held for investment in each credit score category. Domestic card credit scores generally represent FICO scores. These scores are obtained from one of the major credit bureaus at origination and are refreshed monthly thereafter. We approximate non-FICO credit scores to comparable FICO scores for consistency purposes. Balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 660 or below category. (2) Percentages represent period-end loans held for investment in each credit score category. Auto credit scores generally represent average FICO scores obtained from three credit bureaus at the time of application and are not refreshed thereafter. Balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 620 or below category. We present information in the section below on the credit performance of our loan portfolio, including the key metrics we use in tracking changes in the credit quality of our loan portfolio. See Note 3 Loans for additional credit quality information and see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for information on our accounting policies for delinquent and nonperforming loans, charge-offs and troubled debt restructurings ( TDRs ) for each of our loan categories. Delinquency Rates We consider the entire balance of an account to be delinquent if the minimum required payment is not received by the customer due date, measured at each balance sheet date. Our 30+ day delinquency metrics include all loans held for investment that are 30 or more days past due, whereas our 30+ day performing delinquency metrics include all loans held for investment that are 30 or more days past due but are currently classified as performing and accruing interest. The 30+ day delinquency and 30+ day performing delinquency metrics are the same for domestic credit card loans, as we continue to classify these loans as performing until the account is charged off, typically when the account is 180 days past due. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our 2020 Form 10-K for information on our policies for classifying loans as nonperforming for each of our loan categories. We provide additional information on our credit quality metrics in MD&A Business Segment Financial Performance. 42 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 23 presents our 30+ day performing delinquency rates and 30+ day delinquency rates of our portfolio of loans held for investment, by portfolio segment, as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

Nonperforming Loans and Nonperforming Assets Nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans, repossessed assets and other foreclosed assets. Nonperforming loans include loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our 2020 Form 10-K for information on our policies for classifying loans as nonperforming for each of our loan categories. Table 26 presents our nonperforming loans, by portfolio segment, and other nonperforming assets as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. We do not classify loans held for sale as nonperforming.

Interest income foregone related to nonperforming loans was $30 million and $35 million in the first six months of 2021 and 2020, respectively. Foregone interest income represents the amount of interest income in excess of recognized interest income that would have been recorded during the period for nonperforming loans as of the end of the period had the loans performed according to their contractual terms. (2) Nonperforming loan rates are calculated based on nonperforming loans for each category divided by period-end total loans held for investment for each respective category. (3) Excluding the impact of domestic credit card loans, nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans held for investment was 0.67% and 0.65% as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. (4) The denominators used in calculating nonperforming asset rates consist of total loans held for investment and other nonperforming assets. Net Charge-Offs Net charge-offs consist of the amortized cost basis, excluding accrued interest, of loans held for investment that we determine to be uncollectible, net of recovered amounts. We charge off loans as a reduction to the allowance for credit losses when we determine the loan is uncollectible and record subsequent recoveries of previously charged off amounts as increases to the allowance for credit losses. Uncollectible finance charges and fees are reversed through revenue and certain fraud losses are recorded in other non-interest expense. Generally, costs to recover charged off loans are recorded as collection expenses as incurred and included in our consolidated statements of income as a component of other non-interest expense. Our charge-off policy for loans varies based on the loan type. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our 2020 Form 10-K for information on our charge-off policy for each of our loan categories. Table 27 presents our net charge-off amounts and rates, by portfolio segment, in the second quarter and first six months of 2021 and 2020.

Guidance issued by the Federal Banking Agencies and contained in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act ) provides banking organizations with TDR relief for loan modifications to current borrowers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of enrollments in our COVID-19 programs through June 30, 2021 would generally not have resulted in TDR classification under our existing policies as the concession granted was insignificant. We consider the impact of all loan modifications, including those classified as TDRs and those offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, when estimating the credit quality of our loan portfolio and establishing allowance levels. Table 28 presents our amortized cost of loans modified in TDRs as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, which excludes loan modifications that do not meet the definition of a TDR and loans that received relief under the guidance issued by the Federal Banking Agencies and contained in the CARES Act in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The effective interest rate in effect immediately prior to the loan modification is used as the effective interest rate for purposes of measuring impairment using the present value of expected cash flows. If the customer does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan agreement may revert to its original payment terms, generally resulting in any loan outstanding reflected in the appropriate delinquency category and charged off in accordance with our standard charge-off policy. In our Consumer Banking business, the majority of our loans modified in TDRs receive an extension, an interest rate reduction or principal reduction, or a combination of these concessions. In addition, TDRs also occur in connection with bankruptcy of the borrower. In certain bankruptcy discharges, the loan is written down to the collateral value and the charged off amount is reported as principal reduction. Impairment is determined using the present value of expected cash flows or a collateral evaluation for certain auto loans where the collateral value is lower than the amortized cost. In our Commercial Banking business, the majority of loans modified in TDRs receive an extension, with a portion of these loans receiving an interest rate reduction or a gross balance reduction. The impairment on modified commercial loans is generally determined based on the underlying collateral value. We provide additional information on modified loans accounted for as TDRs, including the performance of those loans 46 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents subsequent to modification, in Note 3 Loans. Allowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments Our allowance for credit losses represents management current estimate of expected credit losses over the contractual terms of our loans held for investment as of each balance sheet date. Expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off or expected to be charged off are recognized within the allowance. We also estimate expected credit losses related to unfunded lending commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable. The provision for losses on unfunded lending commitments is included in the provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of income and the related reserve for unfunded lending commitments is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We provide additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used in determining our allowance for credit losses in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our 2020 Form 10-K.

In addition to our cash and cash equivalents, we maintain reserves in the form of investment securities and certain loans that are either readily-marketable or pledgeable. Table 31 below presents the composition of our liquidity reserves as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Table 31: Liquidity Reserves (Dollars in millions) June 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Cash and cash equivalents $ 34,846 $ 40,509 Investment securities available for sale, at fair value 101,766 100,445 FHLB borrowing capacity secured by loans 8,403 10,162 Outstanding FHLB advances and letters of credit secured by loans (41) (72) Investment securities encumbered for Public Funds and others (8,016) (7,052) Total liquidity reserves $ 136,958 $ 143,992 Our liquidity reserves decreased by $7.0 billion to $137.0 billion as of June 30, 2021 from December 31, 2020 primarily driven by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents. See MD&A Risk Management in our 2020 Form 10-K for additional information on our management of liquidity risk. Liquidity Coverage Ratio We are subject to the liquidity coverage ratio ( LCR ) standard as implemented by the Federal Reserve and OCC (the LCR Rule ). The LCR Rule requires us to calculate our LCR daily. It also requires the Company to publicly disclose, on a quarterly basis, its LCR, certain related quantitative liquidity metrics, and a qualitative discussion of its LCR. Our average LCR during the second quarter of 2021 was 141%, which exceeded the LCR Rule requirement of 100%. The calculation and the underlying components are based on our interpretations, expectations and assumptions of relevant regulations, as well as interpretations provided by our regulators, and are subject to change based on changes to future regulations and interpretations. See Part I Item 1. Business Supervision and Regulation in our 2020 Form 10-K for additional information. Net Stable Funding Ratio In October 2020, the Federal Banking Agencies finalized a rule to implement the Net Stable Funding Ratio in the United States (the NSFR Rule ). The NSFR Rule requires the Company and each of the Banks to maintain an amount of available stable funding, which is a weighted measure of a company funding sources over a one-year time horizon, calculated by applying standardized weightings to equity and liabilities based on their expected stability, that is no less than the amount of required stable funding, which is calculated by applying standardized weightings to assets, derivatives exposures and certain other items based on their liquidity characteristics. As a Category III institution, the Company and the Banks are required to maintain available stable funding in an amount at least equal to 85% of its required stable funding. The NSFR Rule became effective on July 1, 2021 and applies to the Company and each of the Banks. The NSFR Rule includes a semi-annual disclosure requirement, with the first public disclosure required after June 30, 2023. Borrowing Capacity We maintain a shelf registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) so that we may periodically offer and sell an indeterminate aggregate amount of senior or subordinated debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock, purchase contracts, warrants and units. There is no limit under this shelf registration to the amount or number of such securities that we may offer and sell, subject to market conditions. In addition, we also maintain a shelf registration that allows us to periodically offer and sell up to $25 billion of securitized debt obligations from our credit card loan securitization trust and a shelf registration that allows us to periodically offer and sell up to $20 billion from our auto loan securitization trusts. 50 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents In addition to our issuance capacity under the shelf registration statements, we also have access to FHLB advances and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The ability to borrow utilizing these sources is based on membership status and the amount is dependent upon the Banks ability to post collateral. As of June 30, 2021, we pledged both loans and securities to the FHLB to secure a maximum borrowing capacity of $19.2 billion, of which $41 million was used. Our FHLB membership is supported by our investment in FHLB stock of $32 million and $30 million as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, which was determined in part based on our outstanding advances. As of June 30, 2021, we pledged loans to secure a borrowing capacity of $21.3 billion under the Federal Reserve Discount Window. Our membership with the Federal Reserve is supported by our investment in Federal Reserve stock, which totaled $1.3 billion as of both June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Funding Our primary source of funding comes from deposits, as they are a stable and relatively low cost source of funding. In addition to deposits, we raise funding through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes and securitized debt obligations, federal funds purchased, securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase and FHLB advances secured by certain portions of our loan and securities portfolios. A key objective in our use of these markets is to maintain access to a diversified mix of wholesale funding sources. See MD&A Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis Funding Sources Composition for additional information on our primary sources of funding.

We provide additional information on the 51 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents composition of deposits in MD&A Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis Funding Sources Composition and in Note 7 Deposits and Borrowings. Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt We access the capital markets to meet our funding needs through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, securitized debt obligations and federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. In addition, we may utilize short-term and long-term FHLB advances secured by certain of our investment securities, multifamily real estate loans and commercial real estate loans. Our short-term borrowings include those borrowings with an original contractual maturity of one year or less and do not include the current portion of long-term debt. The short-term borrowings, which consist of federal funds purchased, securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, increased by $177 million to $845 million as of June 30, 2021 from December 31, 2020 driven by an increase in repurchase agreements. Our long-term debt, which primarily consists of securitized debt obligations and senior and subordinated notes, decreased by $4.4 billion to $35.5 billion as of June 30, 2021 from December 31, 2020 primarily driven by redemptions of our senior unsecured debt and maturities and paydowns in our securitizations. We provide more information on our securitization activity in Note 5 Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations. The following table summarizes issuances of securitized debt obligations, senior and subordinated notes and their respective maturities or redemptions for the second quarter and first six months of 2021 and 2020. We did not have any such issuances for the second quarter and first six months of 2021.

MARKET RISK PROFILE Market risk is the risk of economic loss in the value of our financial instruments due to changes in market factors. Our primary market risk exposures include interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and commodity pricing risk. We are exposed to market risk primarily from the following operations and activities: Traditional banking activities of deposit gathering and lending; Asset/liability management activities including the management of investment securities, short-term and long-term borrowings and derivatives; Foreign operations in the U.K. and Canada within our Credit Card business; and Customer accommodation activities within our Commercial Banking business. We have enterprise-wide risk management policies and limits, approved by our Board of Directors, which govern our market risk management activities. Our objective is to manage our exposure to market risk in accordance with these policies and limits based on prevailing market conditions and long-term expectations. We provide additional information below about our primary sources of market risk, our market risk management strategies and the measures that we use to evaluate these exposures. 53 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk represents exposure to financial instruments whose values vary with the level or volatility of interest rates. We are exposed to interest rate risk primarily from the differences in the timing between the maturities or re-pricing of assets and liabilities. We manage our interest rate risk primarily by entering into interest rate swaps and other derivative instruments which could include caps, floors, options, futures and forward contracts. We use various industry standard market risk measurement techniques and analyses to measure, assess and manage the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and our economic value of equity and changes in foreign exchange rates on our non-dollar-denominated funding and non-dollar equity investments in foreign operations. Net Interest Income Sensitivity Our net interest income sensitivity measure estimates the impact on our projected 12-month baseline net interest income resulting from movements in interest rates. In addition to our existing assets and liabilities, we incorporate expected future business growth assumptions, such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, and plans for projected changes in our funding mix in our baseline forecast. In measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our projected net interest income, we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates detailed in Table 35 below. At the current level of interest rates, our net interest income is expected to increase in higher rate scenarios and decrease modestly in lower rate scenarios. Our current sensitivity to upward shocks has decreased as compared to December 31, 2020, mainly due to the increase in long-term interest rates. Economic Value of Equity Our economic value of equity sensitivity measure estimates the impact on the net present value of our assets and liabilities, including derivative exposures, resulting from movements in interest rates. Our economic value of equity sensitivity measure is calculated based on our existing assets and liabilities, including derivatives, and does not incorporate business growth assumptions or projected balance sheet changes. Key assumptions used in the calculation include projecting rate sensitive prepayments for mortgage securities, loans and other assets, term structure modeling of interest rates, discount spreads, and deposit volume and pricing assumptions. In measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our economic value of equity, we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates detailed in Table 35 below. Our current economic value of equity sensitivity profile demonstrates that our economic value of equity increasing in moderately higher interest rate scenarios (+50 and +100 bps), while decreasing in a lower interest rate scenario (-50 bps). Similar to the changes in net interest income sensitivity, our current economic value of equity sensitivity to upward shocks has also decreased as compared to December 31, 2020 mainly due to the increase in long term interest rates. Table 35 shows the estimated percentage impact on our projected baseline net interest income and economic value of equity calculated under the methodology described above as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. In instances where an interest rate scenario would result in a rate less than 0%, we assume a rate of 0% for that scenario. This assumption applies only to jurisdictions that do not have negative policy rates. In jurisdictions that have negative policy rates, we do not floor interest rates at 0%. 54 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 35: Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis June 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Estimated impact on projected baseline net interest income: +200 basis points 4.0 % 5.6 % +100 basis points 3.3 4.3 +50 basis points 1.9 2.4 50 basis points (1.3) (0.9) Estimated impact on economic value of equity: +200 basis points (0.2) 4.2 +100 basis points 2.8 6.0 +50 basis points 2.1 4.0 50 basis points (3.7) (7.0) In addition to these industry standard measures, we also consider the potential impact of alternative interest rate scenarios, such as stressed rate shocks as well as steepening and flattening yield curve scenarios in our internal interest rate risk management decisions. Limitations of Market Risk Measures The interest rate risk models that we use in deriving these measures incorporate contractual information, internally-developed assumptions and proprietary modeling methodologies, which project borrower and depositor behavior patterns in certain interest rate environments. Other market inputs, such as interest rates, market prices and interest rate volatility, are also critical components of our interest rate risk measures. We regularly evaluate, update and enhance these assumptions, models and analytical tools as we believe appropriate to reflect our best assessment of the market environment and the expected behavior patterns of our existing assets and liabilities. There are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates. The sensitivity analysis described above contemplates only certain movements in interest rates and is performed at a particular point in time based on the existing balance sheet and, in some cases, expected future business growth and funding mix assumptions. The strategic actions that management may take to manage our balance sheet may differ significantly from our projections, which could cause our actual earnings and economic value of equity sensitivities to differ substantially from the above sensitivity analysis. For further information on our interest rate exposures, see Note 8 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Foreign Exchange Risk Foreign exchange risk represents exposure to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in other currencies. We are exposed to foreign exchange risk primarily from the intercompany funding denominated in pound sterling ( GBP ) and the Canadian dollar ( CAD ) that we provide to our businesses in the U.K. and Canada and net equity investments in those businesses. We are also exposed to foreign exchange risk due to changes in the dollar-denominated value of future earnings and cash flows from our foreign operations and from our Euro ( EUR )-denominated borrowings. Our non-dollar denominated intercompany funding and EUR-denominated borrowings expose our earnings to foreign exchange transaction risk. We manage these transaction risks by using forward foreign currency derivatives and cross-currency swaps to hedge our exposures. We measure our foreign exchange transaction risk exposures by applying a 1% U.S. dollar appreciation shock against the value of the non-dollar denominated intercompany funding and EUR-denominated borrowings and their related hedges, which shows the impact to our earnings from foreign exchange risk. Our intercompany funding outstanding was 320 million GBP as of both June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, and 4.7 billion CAD and 5.3 billion CAD as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Our EUR-denominated borrowings outstanding were 1.3 billion EUR as of both June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 55 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Our non-dollar equity investments in foreign operations expose our balance sheet to translation risk in AOCI and our capital ratios. We manage our AOCI exposure by entering into foreign currency derivatives designated as net investment hedges. We measure these exposures by applying a 30% U.S. dollar appreciation shock, which we believe approximates a significant adverse shock over a one-year time horizon, against the value of the equity invested in our foreign operations net of related net investment hedges where applicable. Our gross equity exposures in our U.K. and Canadian operations were 1.7 billion GBP as of both June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, and 1.7 billion CAD and 1.5 billion CAD as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. As a result of our derivative management activities, we believe our net exposure to foreign exchange risk is minimal. Risk related to Customer Accommodation Derivatives We offer interest rate, commodity and foreign currency derivatives as an accommodation to our customers within our Commercial Banking business. We offset the majority of the market risk of these customer accommodation derivatives by entering into offsetting derivatives transactions with other counterparties. We use value-at-risk ( VaR ) as the primary method to measure the market risk in our customer accommodation derivative activities on a daily basis. VaR is a statistical risk measure used to estimate the potential loss from movements observed in the recent market environment. We employ a historical simulation approach using the most recent 500 business days and use a 99 percent confidence level and a holding period of one business day. As a result of offsetting our customer exposures with other counterparties, we believe that our net exposure to market risk in our customer accommodation derivatives is minimal. For further information on our risk related to customer accommodation derivatives, see Note 8 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) Transition On July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority ( FCA ), the regulator for the administration of LIBOR, announced that LIBOR would be transitioned as an interest rate benchmark and that it will no longer compel banks to contribute LIBOR data beyond December 31, 2021. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York established the Alternative Reference Rates Committee ( ARRC ), a group of private market participants and ex-officio members representing banking and financial sector regulators. The ARRC has recommended Secured Overnight Financing Rate ( SOFR ) as the preferred alternative rate for certain U.S. dollar derivative and cash instruments. While the ARRC has recommended SOFR as the replacement rate for LIBOR, some market participants have begun using alternate rates featuring a credit-sensitive element. We are continuing to evaluate the different LIBOR alternatives and how their progression will impact our transition efforts. On March 5, 2021, the ICE Benchmark Administration ( IBA ), the administrator of LIBOR, confirmed its intention to cease publication of the 1-week and 2-month USD LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on December 31, 2021, and the remaining USD LIBOR tenors (overnight; 1, 3, 6, and 12 months) immediately following the LIBOR publication on June 30, 2023. The continuation of USD LIBOR as a representative rate into mid-2023 will allow many legacy USD LIBOR contracts to mature prior to cessation. Following IBA announcement, the FCA formally announced the future permanent cessation and loss of representativeness of LIBOR benchmarks. We have exposures to LIBOR, including loans, derivative contracts, unsecured debt, securitizations, vendor agreements and other instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. To facilitate an orderly transition from LIBOR, we have established a company-wide, cross-functional initiative to oversee and manage our transition away from LIBOR and other Interbank Offered Rates ( IBORs ) to alternative reference rates. We have made progress on our transition efforts as we continue to insert LIBOR transition language ( fallback language ) in new and existing lending contracts as well as fallback language in derivatives contracts and agreements that adheres to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association ( ISDA ) fallback protocol. We also continue to focus our transition efforts on: monitoring market developments and industry practices related to SOFR and other LIBOR replacement indexes; originating loans and transacting in instruments indexed to SOFR and other LIBOR replacement rates; reviewing existing legal contracts and agreements and assessing fallback language impacts; monitoring and reducing our inventory of LIBOR exposures; 56 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents building internal operational readiness and risk management processes, including exposure reporting; implementing necessary updates to our infrastructure including systems, models, valuation tools and processes; and engaging with our clients, industry working groups, and regulators. For a further discussion of the various risks we face in connection with the expected replacement of LIBOR on our operations, see Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors Uncertainty regarding, and transition away from, LIBOR may adversely affect our business in our 2020 Form 10-K. SUPERVISION AND REGULATION Dividends and Stock Repurchases Update On June 24, 2021, the Federal Reserve released the results of its supervisory stress tests for the 2021 cycle. Based on the results, all participating BHCs remained above their risk-based minimum capital requirements in the hypothetical stress scenario. Accordingly, as laid out previously by the Federal Reserve, the temporary capital distribution restrictions put in place in the third quarter of 2020 following the outbreak of COVID-19 ended for all participating BHCs after the second quarter of 2021. All participating BHCs remain subject to the normal capital distribution restrictions of the stress capital buffer framework. Based on the Company 2021 supervisory stress testing results, the Company stress capital buffer requirement for the period beginning on October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022 is 2.5%. Therefore, the Company minimum capital requirements plus the standardized approach capital conservation buffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios under the stress capital buffer framework are 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5%, respectively, for the period from October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022. We provided additional information on our Supervision and Regulation in our 2020 Form 10-K under Part I Item 1.

Numerous factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in such forward-looking statements, including, among other things: the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health measures on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including the increased estimation and forecast uncertainty as a result of the pandemic on our estimates of lifetime expected credit losses in our loan portfolios required in computing our allowance for credit losses; general economic and business conditions in our local markets, including conditions affecting employment levels, interest rates, tariffs, collateral values, consumer income, creditworthiness and confidence, spending and savings that may affect consumer bankruptcies, defaults, charge-offs and deposit activity; an increase or decrease in credit losses, or increased delinquencies, including increases due to a worsening of general economic conditions in the credit environment, and the impact of inaccurate estimates or inadequate reserves; compliance with new and existing laws, regulations and regulatory expectations including the implementation of a regulatory reform agenda; our ability to manage adequate capital or liquidity levels, which could have a negative impact on our financial results and our ability to return capital to our stockholders; the extensive use, reliability, disruption, and accuracy of the models and data we rely on; increased costs, reductions in revenue, reputational damage, legal liability and business disruptions that can result from data protection or privacy incidents or the theft, loss or misuse of information, including as a result of a cyber-attack; developments, changes or actions relating to any litigation, governmental investigation or regulatory enforcement action or matter involving us; the amount and rate of deposit growth and changes in deposit costs; our ability to execute on our strategic and operational plans; our response to competitive pressures; our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by merchants increasing focus on the fees charged by credit card networks and by legislation and regulation impacting such fees; our success in integrating acquired businesses and loan portfolios, and our ability to realize anticipated benefits from announced transactions and strategic partnerships; 58 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents our ability to maintain a compliance, operational, technology and organizational infrastructure suitable for the nature of our business; the success of our marketing efforts in attracting and retaining customers; our risk management strategies; changes in the reputation of, or expectations regarding, the financial services industry or us with respect to practices, products or financial condition; increases or decreases in interest rates and uncertainty with respect to the interest rate environment, including the possibility of a prolonged low-interest rate environment or of negative interest rates uncertainty regarding, and transition away from, the London Interbank Offered Rate; our ability to attract, retain and motivate skilled employees; our assumptions or estimates in our financial statements; limitations on our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries; the soundness of other financial institutions and other third parties; and other risk factors identified from time to time in our public disclosures, including in the reports that we file with the SEC. We expect that the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will heighten the risks associated with many of these factors. 59 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents SUPPLEMENTAL TABLE Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures The following non-GAAP measures consist of TCE, tangible assets and metrics computed using these amounts, which include tangible book value per common share, return on average tangible assets, return on average TCE and TCE ratio. We consider these metrics to be key financial performance measures that management uses in assessing capital adequacy and the level of returns generated. While these non-GAAP measures are widely used by investors, analysts and bank regulatory agencies to assess the capital position of financial services companies, they may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. The following table presents reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the applicable amounts measured in accordance with GAAP.

Basis of Presentation and Use of Estimates The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ( U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and in the related disclosures. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. While management makes its best judgments, actual amounts or results could differ from these estimates. In the opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments have been included for a fair statement of this interim financial information. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements, and related notes thereto, included in Capital One Financial Corporation 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K ( 2020 Form 10-K ). 75 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Newly Adopted Accounting Standards During the Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 Standard Guidance Adoption Timing and Financial Statement Impacts Income Tax Accounting Simplification ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes Issued December 2019 Simplifies various aspects of the guidance on accounting for income taxes.

We discuss these risks and our credit quality indicator for each portfolio segment below. Credit Card Our credit card loan portfolio is highly diversified across millions of accounts and numerous geographies without significant individual exposure. We therefore generally manage credit risk based on portfolios with common risk characteristics. The risk in our credit card loan portfolio correlates to broad economic trends, such as unemployment rates and home values, as well as consumers financial condition, all of which can have a material effect on credit performance. The key indicator we assess in monitoring the credit quality and risk of our credit card loan portfolio is delinquency trends, including an analysis of loan migration between delinquency categories over time. The table below presents our credit card portfolio by delinquency status as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

Similar to our credit card loan portfolio, the risk in our consumer banking loan portfolio correlates to broad economic trends, such as unemployment rates, gross domestic product and home values, as well as consumers financial condition, all of which can have a material effect on credit performance. The key indicator we monitor when assessing the credit quality and risk of our auto loan portfolio is borrower credit scores as they measure the creditworthiness of borrowers. Delinquency trends are the key indicator we assess in monitoring the credit quality and risk of our retail banking loan portfolio.

Commercial Banking The key credit quality indicator for our commercial loan portfolios is our internal risk ratings. We assign internal risk ratings to loans based on relevant information about the ability of the borrowers to repay their debt. In determining the risk rating of a particular loan, some of the factors considered are the borrower current financial condition, historical and projected future credit performance, prospects for support from financially responsible guarantors, the estimated realizable value of any collateral and current economic trends. The scale based on our internal risk rating system is as follows: Noncriticized: Loans that have not been designated as criticized, frequently referred to as pass loans. Criticized performing: Loans in which the financial condition of the obligor is stressed, affecting earnings, cash flows or collateral values. The borrower currently has adequate capacity to meet near-term obligations; however, the stress, left unabated, may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects at some future date. Criticized nonperforming: Loans that are not adequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or the collateral pledged, if any. Loans classified as criticized nonperforming have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses, which jeopardize the full repayment of the debt. These loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain a credit loss if the deficiencies are not corrected and are generally placed on nonaccrual status. We use our internal risk rating system for regulatory reporting, determining the frequency of credit exposure reviews, and evaluating and determining the allowance for credit losses for commercial loans. Generally, loans that are designated as criticized performing and criticized nonperforming are reviewed quarterly by management to determine if they are appropriately classified/rated and whether any impairment exists. Noncriticized loans are also generally reviewed, at least annually, to determine the appropriate risk rating. In addition, we evaluate the risk rating during the renewal process of any loan or if a loan becomes past due. 84 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents The following table presents our commercial banking portfolio of loans held for investment by internal risk ratings as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

In adherence with the guidance, we assessed all loan modifications introduced to current borrowers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic through June 30, 2021, that would have been designated as TDRs under our existing policies, and followed guidance that any such eligible loan modifications made on a temporary and good faith basis are not considered TDRs. We consider the impact of all loan modifications, including those classified as TDRs and those offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, when estimating the credit quality of our loan portfolio and establishing allowance levels. For our Commercial Banking customers, enrollment in a customer assistance program is also considered in the assignment of an internal risk rating. Total recorded TDRs were $ 1.8 billion and $ 2.1 billion as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. TDRs classified as performing in our credit card and consumer banking loan portfolios totaled $ 1.2 billion and $ 1.3 billion as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. TDRs classified as performing in our commercial banking loan portfolio totaled $ 243 million and $ 442 million as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Commitments to lend additional funds on loans modified in TDRs totaled $ 173 million as of both June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Loans Modified in TDRs As part of our loan modification programs to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, we may provide multiple concessions to minimize our economic loss and improve long-term loan performance and collectability. The following tables present the major modification types, amortized cost amounts and financial effects of loans modified in TDRs during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020.

We also pledged loan collateral of $ 26.9 billion and $ 25.5 billion to secure our Federal Reserve Discount Window borrowing capacity of $ 21.3 billion and $ 20.0 billion as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. In addition to loans pledged, we have securitized a portion of our credit card and auto loan portfolios. See Note 5 Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations for additional information . Revolving Loans Converted to Term Loans For the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, we converted $ 38 million and $ 135 million of revolving loans to term loans, respectively, primarily in our domestic credit card and commercial banking loan portfolios. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, we converted $ 89 million and $ 249 million of revolving loans to term loans, respectively, primarily in our domestic credit card loan portfolio. 89 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents NOTE 4 ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND RESERVE FOR UNFUNDED LENDING COMMITMENTS Our allowance for credit losses represents management current estimate of expected credit losses over the contractual terms of our loans held for investment as of each balance sheet date. Expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off or expected to be charged off are recognized within the allowance. When developing an estimate of expected credit losses, we use both quantitative and qualitative methods in considering all available information relevant to assessing collectability. This may include internal information, external information or a combination of both relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Management will consider and may qualitatively adjust for conditions, changes and trends in loan portfolios that may not be captured in modeled results. These adjustments are referred to as qualitative factors and represent management judgment of the imprecision and risks inherent in the processes and assumptions used in establishing the allowance for credit losses. Significant judgment is applied in our estimation of lifetime credit losses. We have unfunded lending commitments in our Commercial Banking business that are not unconditionally cancellable by us and for which we estimate expected credit losses in establishing a reserve. This reserve is measured using the same measurement objectives as the allowance for loans held for investment. We build or release the reserve for unfunded lending commitments through the provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of income, and the related reserve for unfunded lending commitments is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our 2020 Form 10-K for further discussion of the methodology and policy for determining our allowance for credit losses for each of our loan portfolio segments, as well as information on our reserve for unfunded lending commitments. Allowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments Activity The table below summarizes changes in the allowance for credit losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments by portfolio segment for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. Our allowance for credit losses decreased by $ 3.2 billion to $ 12.3 billion as of June 30, 2021 from December 31, 2020, primarily driven by strong credit performance and an improved economic outlook. 90 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 4.1: Allowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments Activity Three Months Ended June 30, 2021 (Dollars in millions) Credit Card Consumer Banking Commercial Banking Total Allowance for credit losses: Balance as of March 31, 2021 $ 10,072 $ 2,498 $ 1,447 $ 14,017 Charge-offs ( 967 ) ( 260 ) ( 8 ) ( 1,235 ) Recoveries (1) 396 271 27 694 Net recoveries (charge-offs) ( 571 ) 11 19 ( 541 ) Provision (benefit) for credit losses ( 635 ) ( 306 ) ( 196 ) ( 1,137 ) Allowance build (release) for credit losses ( 1,206 ) ( 295 ) ( 177 ) ( 1,678 ) Other changes (2) 7 0 0 7 Balance as of June 30, 2021 8,873 2,203 1,270 12,346 Reserve for unfunded lending commitments: Balance as of March 31, 2021 0 0 187 187 Provision (benefit) for losses on unfunded lending commitments 0 0 ( 23 ) ( 23 ) Balance as of June 30, 2021 0 0 164 164 Combined allowance and reserve as of June 30, 2021 $ 8,873 $ 2,203 $ 1,434 $ 12,510 Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 (Dollars in millions) Credit Card Consumer Banking Commercial Banking Total Allowance for credit losses: Balance as of December 31, 2020 $ 11,191 $ 2,715 $ 1,658 $ 15,564 Charge-offs ( 1,960 ) ( 602 ) ( 27 ) ( 2,589 ) Recoveries (1) 756 522 30 1,308 Net recoveries (charge-offs) ( 1,204 ) ( 80 ) 3 ( 1,281 ) Provision (benefit) for credit losses ( 1,127 ) ( 432 ) ( 391 ) ( 1,950 ) Allowance build (release) for credit losses ( 2,331 ) ( 512 ) ( 388 ) ( 3,231 ) Other changes (2) 13 0 0 13 Balance as of June 30, 2021 8,873 2,203 1,270 12,346 Reserve for unfunded lending commitments: Balance as of December 31, 2020 0 0 195 195 Provision (benefit) for losses on unfunded lending commitments 0 0 ( 31 ) ( 31 ) Balance as of June 30, 2021 0 0 164 164 Combined allowance and reserve as of June 30, 2021 $ 8,873 $ 2,203 $ 1,434 $ 12,510 91 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Three Months Ended June 30, 2020 (Dollars in millions) Credit Card Consumer Banking Commercial Banking Total Allowance for credit losses: Balance as of March 31, 2020 $ 10,346 $ 2,154 $ 1,573 $ 14,073 Charge-offs ( 1,612 ) ( 416 ) ( 103 ) ( 2,131 ) Recoveries (1) 401 224 1 626 Net charge-offs ( 1,211 ) ( 192 ) ( 102 ) ( 1,505 ) Provision (benefit) for credit losses 2,944 876 432 4,252 Allowance build (release) for credit losses 1,733 684 330 2,747 Other changes (2) 12 0 0 12 Balance as of June 30, 2020 12,091 2,838 1,903 16,832 Reserve for unfunded lending commitments: Balance as of March 31, 2020 0 0 223 223 Provision (benefit) for losses on unfunded lending commitments 0 0 ( 5 ) ( 5 ) Balance as of June 30, 2020 0 0 218 218 Combined allowance and reserve as of June 30, 2020 $ 12,091 $ 2,838 $ 2,121 $ 17,050 Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 (Dollars in millions) Credit Card Consumer Banking Commercial Banking Total Allowance for credit losses: Balance as of December 31, 2019 $ 5,395 $ 1,038 $ 775 $ 7,208 Cumulative effects from adoption of the CECL standard 2,241 502 102 2,845 Finance charge and fee reserve reclassification (3) 462 0 0 462 Balance as of January 1, 2020 8,098 1,540 877 10,515 Charge-offs ( 3,461 ) ( 912 ) ( 215 ) ( 4,588 ) Recoveries (1) 814 474 4 1,292 Net charge-offs ( 2,647 ) ( 438 ) ( 211 ) ( 3,296 ) Provision (benefit) for credit losses 6,646 1,736 1,237 9,619 Allowance build (release) for credit losses 3,999 1,298 1,026 6,323 Other changes (2) ( 6 ) 0 0 ( 6 ) Balance as of June 30, 2020 12,091 2,838 1,903 16,832 Reserve for unfunded lending commitments: Balance as of December 31, 2019 0 5 130 135 Cumulative effects from adoption of the CECL standard 0 ( 5 ) 42 37 Balance as of January 1, 2020 0 0 172 172 Provision (benefit) for losses on unfunded lending commitments 0 0 46 46 Balance as of June 30, 2020 0 0 218 218 Combined allowance and reserve as of June 30, 2020 $ 12,091 $ 2,838 $ 2,121 $ 17,050 __________ (1) The amount and timing of recoveries are impacted by our collection strategies, which are based on customer behavior and risk profile and include direct customer communications, repossession of collateral, the periodic sale of charged off loans as well as additional strategies, such as litigation.

(3) Concurrent with our adoption of the CECL standard in the first quarter of 2020, we reclassified our finance charge and fee reserve to our allowance for credit losses, with a corresponding increase to credit card loans held for investment. 92 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Credit Card Partnership Loss Sharing Arrangements We have certain credit card partnership agreements that are presented within our consolidated financial statements on a net basis, in which our partner agrees to share a portion of the credit losses on the underlying loan portfolio. The expected reimbursements from these partners are netted against our allowance for credit losses. Our methodology for estimating reimbursements is consistent with the methodology we use to estimate the allowance for credit losses on our credit card loan receivables. These expected reimbursements result in reductions to net charge-offs and the provision for credit losses. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our 2020 Form 10-K for further discussion of our credit card partnership agreements. The table below summarizes the changes in the estimated reimbursements from these partners for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020.

Our primary involvement with VIEs is related to our securitization transactions in which we transfer assets to securitization trusts. We primarily securitize credit card and auto loans, which have provided a source of funding for us and enabled us to transfer a certain portion of the economic risk of the loans or related debt securities to third parties. The entity that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is referred to as the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the VIE. The majority of the VIEs in which we are involved have been consolidated in our financial statements. Summary of Consolidated and Unconsolidated VIEs The assets of our consolidated VIEs primarily consist of cash, loan receivables and the related allowance for credit losses, which we report on our consolidated balance sheets under restricted cash for securitization investors, loans held in consolidated trusts and allowance for credit losses, respectively. The assets of a particular VIE are the primary source of funds to settle its obligations. Creditors of these VIEs typically do not have recourse to our general credit. Liabilities primarily consist of debt securities issued by the VIEs, which we report under securitized debt obligations on our consolidated balance sheets. For unconsolidated VIEs, we present the carrying amount of assets and liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheets and our maximum exposure to loss. Our maximum exposure to loss is estimated based on the unlikely event that all of the assets in the VIEs become worthless and we are required to meet our maximum remaining funding obligations. The tables below present a summary of VIEs in which we had continuing involvement or held a significant variable interest, aggregated based on VIEs with similar characteristics as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. We separately present information for consolidated and unconsolidated VIEs. Table 5.1: Carrying Amount of Consolidated and Unconsolidated VIEs June 30, 2021 Consolidated Unconsolidated (Dollars in millions) Carrying Amount of Assets Carrying Amount of Liabilities Carrying Amount of Assets Carrying Amount of Liabilities Maximum Exposure to Loss Securitization-Related VIEs: (1) Credit card loan securitizations (2) $ 20,671 $ 9,115 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 Auto loan securitizations 1,768 1,509 0 0 0 Total securitization-related VIEs 22,439 10,624 0 0 0 Other VIEs: (3) Affordable housing entities 272 31 4,763 1,427 4,763 Entities that provide capital to low-income and rural communities 2,035 26 0 0 0 Other 0 0 411 0 411 Total other VIEs 2,307 57 5,174 1,427 5,174 Total VIEs $ 24,746 $ 10,681 $ 5,174 $ 1,427 $ 5,174 94 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents December 31, 2020 Consolidated Unconsolidated (Dollars in millions) Carrying Amount of Assets Carrying Amount of Liabilities Carrying Amount of Assets Carrying Amount of Liabilities Maximum Exposure to Loss Securitization-Related VIEs: (1) Credit card loan securitizations (2) $ 22,066 $ 10,338 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 Auto loan securitizations 2,360 2,055 0 0 0 Total securitization-related VIEs 24,426 12,393 0 0 0 Other VIEs: (3) Affordable housing entities 242 17 4,602 1,240 4,602 Entities that provide capital to low-income and rural communities 1,951 26 0 0 0 Other 0 0 436 0 436 Total other VIEs 2,193 43 5,038 1,240 5,038 Total VIEs $ 26,619 $ 12,436 $ 5,038 $ 1,240 $ 5,038 __________ (1) Excludes insignificant VIEs from previously exited businesses. (2) Represents the carrying amount of assets and liabilities owned by the VIE, which includes the seller interest and repurchased notes held by other related parties. (3) In certain investment structures, we consolidate a VIE which in turn holds as its primary asset an investment in an unconsolidated VIE. In these instances, we disclose the carrying amount of assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as unconsolidated VIEs to avoid duplicating our exposure, as the unconsolidated VIEs are generally the operating entities generating the exposure. The carrying amount of assets and liabilities included in the unconsolidated VIE columns above related to these investment structures were $ 2.2 billion of assets and $ 606 million of liabilities as of June 30, 2021, and $ 2.3 billion of assets and $ 596 million of liabilities as of December 31, 2020. Securitization-Related VIEs In a securitization transaction, assets are transferred to a trust, which generally meets the definition of a VIE. We engage in securitization activities as an issuer and an investor. Our primary securitization issuance activity includes credit card and auto securitizations, conducted through securitization trusts which we consolidate. Our continuing involvement in these securitization transactions mainly consists of acting as the primary servicer and holding certain retained interests. In our multifamily agency business, we originate multifamily commercial real estate loans and transfer them to Government-sponsored enterprise ( GSEs ) who may, in turn, securitize them. We retain the related mortgage servicing rights ( MSRs ) and service the transferred loans pursuant to the guidelines set forth by the GSEs. As an investor, we hold primarily RMBS, CMBS, and ABS in our investment securities portfolio, which represent variable interests in the respective securitization trusts from which those securities were issued. We do not consolidate the securitization trusts employed in these transactions as we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these securitization trusts. We exclude these VIEs from the tables within this note because we do not consider our continuing involvement with these VIEs to be significant as we either invest in securities issued by the VIE and were not involved in the design of the VIE or no transfers have occurred between the VIE and us. Our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with these VIEs is the carrying value of the MSRs and investment securities on our consolidated balance sheets as well as our contractual obligations under loss sharing arrangements. See Note 6 Goodwill and Intangible Assets for information related to our MSRs associated with these securitizations and Note 2 Investment Securities for more information on the securities held in our investment securities portfolio. In addition, where we have certain lending arrangements in the normal course of business with entities that could be VIEs, we have also excluded these VIEs from the tables presented in this note. See Note 3 Loans for additional information regarding our lending arrangements in the normal course of business. 95 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents The table below presents our continuing involvement in certain securitization-related VIEs as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Table 5.2: Continuing Involvement in Securitization-Related VIEs (Dollars in millions) Credit Card Auto June 30, 2021: Securities held by third-party investors $ 9,054 $ 1,507 Receivables in the trust 21,803 1,664 Cash balance of spread or reserve accounts 0 10 Retained interests Yes Yes Servicing retained Yes Yes December 31, 2020: Securities held by third-party investors $ 10,361 $ 2,053 Receivables in the trust 23,683 2,243 Cash balance of spread or reserve accounts 0 10 Retained interests Yes Yes Servicing retained Yes Yes Credit Card Securitizations We securitize a portion of our credit card loans which provides a source of funding for us. Credit card securitizations involve the transfer of credit card receivables to securitization trusts. These trusts then issue debt securities collateralized by the transferred receivables to third-party investors. We hold certain retained interests in our credit card securitizations and continue to service the receivables in these trusts. We consolidate these trusts because we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary as we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts, and the right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the trusts. Auto Securitizations Similar to our credit card securitizations, we securitize a portion of our auto loans which provides a source of funding for us. Auto securitization involves the transfer of auto loans to securitization trusts. These trusts then issue debt securities collateralized by the transferred loans to third-party investors. We hold certain retained interests and continue to service the loans in these trusts. We consolidate these trusts because we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary as we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts, and the right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the trusts. Other VIEs Affordable Housing Entities As part of our community reinvestment initiatives, we invest in private investment funds that make equity investments in multifamily affordable housing properties. We receive affordable housing tax credits for these investments. The activities of these entities are financed with a combination of invested equity capital and debt. We account for certain investments in qualified affordable housing projects using the proportional amortization method if certain criteria are met. The proportional amortization method amortizes the cost of the investment over the period in which the investor expects to receive tax credits and other tax benefits, and the resulting amortization is recognized as a component of income tax expense attributable to continuing operations. For the six months ended June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, we recognized amortization of $ 317 million and $ 285 million, respectively, and tax credits of $ 423 million and $ 622 million, respectively, associated with these investments within income tax provision or benefit. The carrying value of our equity investments in these qualified affordable housing projects was $ 4.6 billion and $ 4.5 billion as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. We are periodically required to provide additional financial or other support during the period of the investments. Our liability for these unfunded 96 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents commitments was $ 1.6 billion and $ 1.5 billion as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, and is largely expected to be paid from 2021 to 2023. For those investment funds considered to be VIEs, we are not required to consolidate them if we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of those entities. We record our interests in these unconsolidated VIEs in loans held for investment, other assets and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Our maximum exposure to these entities is limited to our variable interests in the entities which consisted of assets of approximately $ 4.8 billion and $ 4.6 billion as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The creditors of the VIEs have no recourse to our general credit and we do not provide additional financial or other support other than during the period that we are contractually required to provide it. The total assets of the unconsolidated VIE investment funds were approximately $ 11.6 billion and $ 11.0 billion as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Entities that Provide Capital to Low-Income and Rural Communities We hold variable interests in entities ( Investor Entities ) that invest in community development entities ( CDEs ) that provide debt financing to businesses and non-profit entities in low-income and rural communities. Variable interests in the CDEs held by the consolidated Investor Entities are also our variable interests. The activities of the Investor Entities are financed with a combination of invested equity capital and debt. The activities of the CDEs are financed solely with invested equity capital. We receive federal and state tax credits for these investments. We consolidate the VIEs in which we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE economic performance and where we have the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to the VIE. We consolidate other investments and CDEs that are not considered to be VIEs, but where we hold a controlling financial interest. The assets of the VIEs that we consolidated, which totaled approximately $ 2.0 billion as of both June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets in cash, loans held for investment, and other assets. The liabilities are reflected in other liabilities. The creditors of the VIEs have no recourse to our general credit. We have not provided additional financial or other support other than during the period that we are contractually required to provide it. Other We hold variable interests in other VIEs, including companies that promote renewable energy sources and other equity method investments. We were not required to consolidate these VIEs because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact their economic performance. Our maximum exposure to these VIEs is limited to the investments on our consolidated balance sheets of $ 411 million and $ 436 million as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The creditors of the other VIEs have no recourse to our general credit. We have not provided additional financial or other support other than during the period that we are contractually required to provide it. 97 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents NOTE 6 GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS The table below presents our goodwill, intangible assets and MSRs as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

We also use a variety of other funding sources including short-term borrowings, senior and subordinated notes, securitized debt obligations and other borrowings. Securitized debt obligations are presented separately on our consolidated balance sheets, as they represent obligations of consolidated securitization trusts, while federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, senior and subordinated notes and other borrowings, including FHLB advances, are included in other debt on our consolidated balance sheets. Our total short-term borrowings generally consist of federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. Our long-term debt consists of borrowings with an original contractual maturity of greater than one year. The following tables summarize the components of our deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The carrying value presented below for these borrowings includes unamortized debt premiums and discounts, net of debt issuance costs and fair value hedge accounting adjustments.

Our primary market risks stem from the impact on our earnings and economic value of equity due to changes in interest rates and, to a lesser extent, changes in foreign exchange rates. We manage our interest rate sensitivity by employing several techniques, which include changing the duration and re-pricing characteristics of various assets and liabilities by using interest rate derivatives. We also use foreign currency derivatives to limit our earnings and capital exposures to foreign exchange risk by hedging exposures denominated in foreign currencies. We primarily use interest rate and foreign currency swaps to hedge, but we may also use a variety of other derivative instruments, including caps, floors, options, futures and forward contracts, to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risks. We designate these risk management derivatives as either qualifying accounting hedges or free-standing derivatives. Qualifying accounting hedges are further designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges. Free-standing derivatives are economic hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting. We also offer interest rate, commodity, foreign currency derivatives and other contracts as an accommodation to our customers within our Commercial Banking business. We enter into these derivatives with our customers primarily to help them manage their interest rate risks, hedge their energy and other commodities exposures, and manage foreign currency fluctuations. We then enter into derivative contracts with counterparties to economically hedge substantially all of our subsequent exposures. See below for additional information on our use of derivatives and how we account for them: Fair Value Hedges: We designate derivatives as fair value hedges when they are used to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities, which fluctuate in value as a result of movements in interest rates. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are presented in the same line item in our consolidated statements of income as the earnings effect of the hedged items. Our fair value hedges primarily consist of interest rate swaps that are intended to modify our exposure to interest rate risk on various fixed-rate financial assets and liabilities. Cash Flow Hedges: We designate derivatives as cash flow hedges when they are used to manage our exposure to variability in cash flows related to forecasted transactions. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) . Those amounts are reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the forecasted transactions impact earnings and presented in the same line item in our consolidated statements of income as the earnings effect of the hedged items. Our cash flow hedges use interest rate swaps and floors that are intended to hedge the variability in interest receipts or interest payments on some of our variable-rate financial assets or liabilities. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our exposure to variability in cash flows related to intercompany borrowings denominated in foreign currencies. Net Investment Hedges: We use net investment hedges to manage the foreign currency exposure related to our net investments in foreign operations that have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in the fair value of net investment hedges are recorded in the translation adjustment component of AOCI, offsetting the translation gain or loss from those foreign operations. We execute net investment hedges using foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the translation exposure of the net investment in our foreign operations under the forward method. Free-Standing Derivatives: Our free-standing derivatives primarily consist of our customer accommodation derivatives and other economic hedges. The customer accommodation derivatives and the related offsetting contracts are mainly interest rate, commodity and foreign currency contracts. The other free-standing derivatives are primarily used to economically hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of our commercial mortgage loan origination and purchase commitments as well as other interests held. Changes in the fair value of free-standing derivatives are recorded in earnings as a component of other non-interest income. 100 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Derivatives Counterparty Credit Risk Counterparty Types Derivative instruments contain an element of credit risk that arises from the potential failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of the contract, including making payments due upon maturity of certain derivative instruments. We execute our derivative contracts primarily in over-the-counter ( OTC ) markets. We also execute interest rate and commodity futures in the exchange-traded derivative markets. Our OTC derivatives consist of both trades cleared through central counterparty clearinghouses ( CCPs ) and uncleared bilateral contracts. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange ( CME ), the Intercontinental Exchange ( ICE ) and the LCH Group ( LCH ) are our CCPs for our centrally cleared contracts. In our uncleared bilateral contracts, we enter into agreements directly with our derivative counterparties. Counterparty Credit Risk Management We manage the counterparty credit risk associated with derivative instruments by entering into legally enforceable master netting arrangements, where possible, and exchanging collateral with our counterparties, typically in the form of cash or high-quality liquid securities. The amount of collateral exchanged is dependent upon the fair value of the derivative instruments as well as the fair value of the pledged collateral and will vary over time as market variables change. When valuing collateral, an estimate of the variation in price and liquidity over time is subtracted in the form of a haircut to discount the value of the collateral pledged. Our exposure to derivative counterparty credit risk, at any point in time, is equal to the amount reported as a derivative asset on our balance sheet. The fair value of our derivatives is adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and any associated cash collateral received or pledged. See Table 8.3 for our net exposure associated with derivatives. The terms under which we collateralize our exposures differ between cleared exposures and uncleared bilateral exposures. CCPs : We clear eligible OTC derivatives with CCPs as part of our regulatory requirements. Futures commission merchants ( FCMs ) serve as the intermediary between CCPs and us. CCPs require that we post initial and variation margin through our FCMs to mitigate the risk of non-payment or default. Initial margin is required upfront by CCPs as collateral against potential losses on our cleared derivative contracts and variation margin is exchanged on a daily basis to account for mark-to-market changes in those derivative contracts. For CME, ICE and LCH-cleared OTC derivatives, we characterize variation margin cash payments as settlements. Our FCM agreements governing these derivative transactions include provisions that may require us to post additional collateral under certain circumstances. Bilateral Counterparties : We enter into legally enforceable master netting agreements and collateral agreements, where possible, with bilateral derivative counterparties to mitigate the risk of default. We review our collateral positions on a daily basis and exchange collateral with our counterparties in accordance with these agreements. These bilateral agreements typically provide the right to offset exposure with the same counterparty and require the party in a net liability position to post collateral. Agreements with certain bilateral counterparties require both parties to maintain collateral in the event the fair values of derivative instruments exceed established exposure thresholds. Certain of these bilateral agreements include provisions requiring that our debt maintain a credit rating of investment grade or above by each of the major credit rating agencies. In the event of a downgrade of our debt credit rating below investment grade, some of our counterparties would have the right to terminate their derivative contract and close out existing positions. Credit Risk Valuation Adjustments We record counterparty credit valuation adjustments ( CVAs ) on our derivative assets to reflect the credit quality of our counterparties. We consider collateral and legally enforceable master netting agreements that mitigate our credit exposure to each counterparty in determining CVAs, which may be adjusted due to changes in the fair values of the derivative contracts, collateral, and creditworthiness of the counterparty. We also record debit valuation adjustments ( DVAs ) to adjust the fair values of our derivative liabilities to reflect the impact of our own credit quality. 101 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Balance Sheet Presentation The following table summarizes the notional amounts and fair values of our derivative instruments as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, which are segregated by derivatives that are designated as accounting hedges and those that are not, and are further segregated by type of contract within those two categories. The total derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and any associated cash collateral received or pledged. Derivative assets and liabilities are included in other assets and other liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets, and their related gains or losses are included in operating activities as changes in other assets and other liabilities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

The amortized cost basis of this portfolio was $ 249 million, the amount of the designated hedged items was $ 225 million, and the cumulative basis adjustments associated with these hedges was $ 1 million as of June 30, 2021. We had no such hedging relationships as of December 31, 2020. (2) Carrying value represents amortized cost. Balance Sheet Offsetting of Financial Assets and Liabilities Derivative contracts and repurchase agreements that we execute bilaterally in the OTC market are generally governed by enforceable master netting arrangements where we generally have the right to offset exposure with the same counterparty. Either counterparty can generally request to net settle all contracts through a single payment upon default on, or termination of, any one contract. We elect to offset the derivative assets and liabilities under master netting arrangements for balance sheet presentation where a right of setoff exists. For derivative contracts entered into under master netting arrangements for which we have not been able to confirm the enforceability of the setoff rights, or those not subject to master netting arrangements, we do not offset our derivative positions for balance sheet presentation. The following table presents the gross and net fair values of our derivative assets, derivative liabilities, resale and repurchase agreements and the related offsetting amounts permitted under U.S. GAAP as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The table also includes cash and non-cash collateral received or pledged in accordance with such arrangements. The amount of collateral presented, however, is limited to the amount of the related net derivative fair values or outstanding balances; therefore, instances of over-collateralization are excluded. 103 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 8.3: Offsetting of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Gross Amounts Gross Amounts Offset in the Balance Sheet Net Amounts as Recognized Securities Collateral Held Under Master Netting Agreements Net Exposure (Dollars in millions) Financial Instruments Cash Collateral Received As of June 30, 2021 Derivative assets (1) $ 3,716 $ ( 441 ) $ ( 523 ) $ 2,752 $ 0 $ 2,752 As of December 31, 2020 Derivative assets (1) 3,415 ( 383 ) ( 765 ) 2,267 0 2,267 Gross Amounts Gross Amounts Offset in the Balance Sheet Net Amounts as Recognized Securities Collateral Pledged Under Master Netting Agreements Net Exposure (Dollars in millions) Financial Instruments Cash Collateral Pledged As of June 30, 2021 Derivative liabilities (1) $ 2,410 $ ( 441 ) $ ( 409 ) $ 1,560 $ 0 $ 1,560 Repurchase agreements (2) 845 0 0 845 ( 845 ) 0 As of December 31, 2020 Derivative liabilities (1) 1,518 ( 383 ) ( 356 ) 779 0 779 Repurchase agreements (2) 668 0 0 668 ( 668 ) 0 __________ (1) We received cash collateral from derivative counterparties totaling $ 574 million and $ 862 million as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.

ended June 30, 2020, respectively, related to basis adjustments on discontinued hedges. (2) Changes in fair values of cross-currency swaps attributable to changes in cross-currency basis spreads are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recorded in other comprehensive income. The initial value of the excluded component is recognized in earnings over the life of the swap under the amortization approach. (3) See Note 9 Stockholders Equity for the effects of cash flow and net investment hedges on AOCI and amounts reclassified to net income, net of tax. (4) We recognized a gain of $ 77 million and $ 162 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, and a loss of $ 299 million and a gain of $ 93 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively, on foreign exchange contracts reclassified from AOCI. These amounts were largely offset by the foreign currency transaction gains (losses) on our foreign currency denominated intercompany funding included in other non-interest income on our consolidated statements of income. In the next 12 months, we expect to reclassify into earnings net after-tax gains of $ 507 million recorded in AOCI as of June 30, 2021. These amounts will offset the cash flows associated with the hedged forecasted transactions. The maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions were hedged was approximately 6.7 years as of June 30, 2021. The amount we expect to reclassify into earnings may change as a result of changes in market conditions and ongoing actions taken as part of our overall risk management strategy. 108 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Free-Standing Derivatives The net impacts to our consolidated statements of income related to free-standing derivatives are presented below for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020.

F or the six months ended June 30, 2021, awards of 51 thousand shares were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because their inclusion would be anti-dil utive. In periods of net loss available to common stockholders, dilutive securities are excluded as their inclusion would have an anti-dilutive effect. Accordingly, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, awards of 362 thousand shares and options of 2.6 million shares with an exercise price ranging from $ 45.75 to $ 86.34 and awards of 956 thousand shares and options of 2.7 million shares with an exercise price ranging from $ 36.55 to $ 86.34 were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share , respectively. 114 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents NOTE 11 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT Fair value, also referred to as an exit price, is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The fair value accounting guidance provides a three-level fair value hierarchy for classifying financial instruments. This hierarchy is based on the markets in which the assets or liabilities trade and whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable. The fair value measurement of a financial asset or liability is assigned a level based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: Level 1: Valuation is based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Valuation is based on observable market-based inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3: Valuation is generated from techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. Valuation techniques include pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques. The accounting guidance for fair value measurements requires that we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in determining fair value. The accounting guidance provides for the irrevocable option to elect, on a contract-by-contract basis, to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value at inception of the contract and record any subsequent changes in fair value in earnings. The determination and classification of financial instruments in the fair value hierarchy is performed at the end of each reporting period. We consider all available information, including observable market data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs. For additional information on the valuation techniques used in estimating the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities on a recurring basis, see Note 16 Fair Value Measurement in our 2020 Form 10-K. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The following table displays our assets and liabilities measured on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

Level 3 Recurring Fair Val ue Rollforward The table below presents a reconciliation for all assets and liabilities measured and recognized at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. Generally, transfers into Level 3 were primarily driven by the usage of unobservable assumptions in the pricing of these financial instruments as evidenced by wider pricing variations among pricing vendors and transfers out of Level 3 were primarily driven by the usage of assumptions corroborated by market observable information as evidenced by tighter pricing among multiple pricing sources.

Significant Level 3 Fair Value Asset and Liability Inputs Generally, uncertainties in fair value measurements of financial instruments, such as changes in unobservable inputs, may have a significant impact on fair value. Certain of these unobservable inputs will, in isolation, have a directionally consistent impact on the fair value of the instrument for a given change in that input. Alternatively, the fair value of the instrument may move in an opposite direction for a given change in another input. In general, an increase in the discount rate, default rates, loss severity and credit spreads, in isolation, would result in a decrease in the fair value measurement. In addition, an increase in default rates would generally be accompanied by a decrease in recovery rates, slower prepayment rates and an increase in liquidity spreads. Techniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value Measurements The following table presents the significant unobservable inputs used to determine the fair values of our Level 3 financial instruments on a recurring basis. We utilize multiple vendor pricing services to obtain fair value for our securities. Several of our vendor pricing services are only able to provide unobservable input information for a limited number of securities due to software licensing restrictions. Other vendor pricing services are able to provide unobservable input information for all securities for which they provide a valuation. As a result, the unobservable input information for the securities available for sale presented below represents a composite summary of all information we are able to obtain. The unobservable input information for all other Level 3 financial instruments is based on the assumptions used in our internal valuation models. 118 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 11.3: Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements (Dollars in millions) Fair Value at June 30, 2021 Significant Valuation Techniques Significant Unobservable Inputs Range Weighted Average (1) Securities available for sale: RMBS $ 289 Discounted cash flows (vendor pricing) Yield Voluntary prepayment rate Default rate Loss severity 1 - 19 % 5 - 20 % 1 - 11 % 30 - 100 % 3 % 11 % 2 % 68 % CMBS 9 Discounted cash flows (vendor pricing) Yield 0 - 2 % 1 % Other assets: Retained interests in securitizations (2) 46 Discounted cash flows Life of receivables (months) Voluntary prepayment rate Discount rate Default rate Loss severity 33 - 40 9 - 15 % 2 - 11 % 2 - 4 % 55 - 151 % N/A Net derivative assets (liabilities) 19 Discounted cash flows Swap rates 1 - 2 % 1 % Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements (Dollars in millions) Fair Value at December 31, 2020 Significant Valuation Techniques Significant Unobservable Inputs Range Weighted Average (1) Securities available for sale: RMBS $ 328 Discounted cash flows (vendor pricing) Yield Voluntary prepayment rate Default rate Loss severity 2 - 12 % 8 - 15 % 0 - 11 % 30 - 100 % 3 % 10 % 2 % 73 % CMBS 111 Discounted cash flows (vendor pricing) Yield 1 - 3 % 2 % Other assets: Retained interests in securitizations (2) 55 Discounted cash flows Life of receivables (months) Voluntary prepayment rate Discount rate Default rate Loss severity 37 - 52 3 - 13 % 2 - 12 % 3 - 3 % 55 - 70 % N/A Net derivative assets (liabilities) 31 Discounted cash flows Swap rates 1 % 1 % __________ (1) Weighted averages are calculated by using the product of the input multiplied by the relative fair value of the instruments. (2) Due to the nature of the various mortgage securitization structures in which we have retained interests, it is not meaningful to present a consolidated weighted average for the significant unobservable inputs. 119 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis We are required to measure and recognize certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on the consolidated balance sheets. These assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (for example, from the application of lower of cost or fair value accounting or when we evaluate for impairment). The following table presents the carrying value of the assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and still held as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, and for which a nonrecurring fair value measurement was recorded during the six and twelve months then ended.

As of December 31, 2020, other assets included equity investments accounted for under the measurement alternative of $ 25 million, repossessed assets of $ 42 million and long-lived assets held for sale of $ 108 million. In the above table, loans held for investment are generally valued based in part on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral and the non-recoverable rate, which is considered to be a significant unobservable input. The non-recoverable rate ranged from 0 % to 100 %, with a weighted average of 23 %, and from 0 % to 89 %, with a weighted average of 14 %, as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The weighted average non-recoverable rate is calculated based on the estimated market value of the underlying collateral. The significant unobservable inputs and related quantitative information related to fair value of the other assets are not meaningful to disclose as they vary significantly across properties and collateral.

The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into or managed as a part of our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio, asset/liability management by our centralized Corporate Treasury group and residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate that is not assessed to our primary business segments, are included in the Other category. Basis of Presentation We report the results of each of our business segments on a continuing operations basis. The results of our individual businesses reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources. Business Segment Reporting Methodology The results of our business segments are intended to present each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. Our internal management and reporting process used to derive our segment results employs various allocation methodologies, including funds transfer pricing, to assign certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses directly or indirectly attributable to each business segment. Our funds transfer pricing process provides a funds credit for sources of funds, such as deposits generated by our Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking businesses, and a funds charge for the use of funds by each segment. Due to the integrated nature of our business segments, estimates and judgments have been made in allocating certain revenue and expense items. Transactions between segments are based on specific criteria or approximate third-party rates. We regularly assess the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, which may result in the implementation of refinements or changes in future periods. We provide additional information on the allocation methodologies used to derive our business segment results in Note 17 Business Segments and Revenue from Contracts with Customers in our 2020 Form 10-K. Segment Results and Reconciliation We may periodically change our business segments or reclassify business segment results based on modifications to our management reporting methodologies or changes in organizational alignment. The following table presents our business segment results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, selected balance sheet data as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, and a reconciliation of our total business segment results to our reported consolidated income from continuing operations, loans held for investment and deposits. 122 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 12.1: Segment Results and Reconciliation Three Months Ended June 30, 2021 (Dollars in millions) Credit Card Consumer Banking Commercial Banking (1) Other (1) Consolidated Total Net interest income (loss) $ 3,217 $ 2,101 $ 460 $ ( 35 ) $ 5,743 Non-interest income (loss) 1,253 144 257 ( 23 ) 1,631 Total net revenue (loss) (2) 4,470 2,245 717 ( 58 ) 7,374 Provision (benefit) for credit losses ( 635 ) ( 306 ) ( 219 ) 0 ( 1,160 ) Non-interest expense 2,263 1,123 417 163 3,966 Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes 2,842 1,428 519 ( 221 ) 4,568 Income tax provision (benefit) 672 337 123 ( 101 ) 1,031 Income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax $ 2,170 $ 1,091 $ 396 $ ( 120 ) $ 3,537 Loans held for investment $ 101,017 $ 74,759 $ 73,821 $ 0 $ 249,597 Deposits 0 251,155 42,973 12,180 306,308 Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 (Dollars in millions) Credit Card Consumer Banking Commercial Banking (1) Other (1) Consolidated Total Net interest income (loss) $ 6,589 $ 4,131 $ 980 $ ( 135 ) $ 11,565 Non-interest income (loss) 2,282 285 497 ( 142 ) 2,922 Total net revenue (loss) (2) 8,871 4,416 1,477 ( 277 ) 14,487 Provision (benefit) for credit losses ( 1,127 ) ( 432 ) ( 422 ) ( 2 ) ( 1,983 ) Non-interest expense 4,398 2,240 836 232 7,706 Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes 5,600 2,608 1,063 ( 507 ) 8,764 Income tax provision (benefit) 1,325 615 251 ( 291 ) 1,900 Income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax $ 4,275 $ 1,993 $ 812 $ ( 216 ) $ 6,864 Loans held for investment $ 101,017 $ 74,759 $ 73,821 $ 0 $ 249,597 Deposits 0 251,155 42,973 12,180 306,308 Three Months Ended June 30, 2020 (Dollars in millions) Credit Card Consumer Banking Commercial Banking (1) Other (1) Consolidated Total Net interest income (loss) $ 3,369 $ 1,665 $ 518 $ ( 92 ) $ 5,460 Non-interest income (loss) 845 97 180 ( 26 ) 1,096 Total net revenue (loss) (2) 4,214 1,762 698 ( 118 ) 6,556 Provision (benefit) for credit losses 2,944 876 427 ( 1 ) 4,246 Non-interest expense 1,969 1,036 425 340 3,770 Loss from continuing operations before income taxes ( 699 ) ( 150 ) ( 154 ) ( 457 ) ( 1,460 ) Income tax benefit ( 166 ) ( 36 ) ( 36 ) ( 305 ) ( 543 ) Loss from continuing operations, net of tax $ ( 533 ) $ ( 114 ) $ ( 118 ) $ ( 152 ) $ ( 917 ) Loans held for investment $ 107,310 $ 66,712 $ 77,490 $ 0 $ 251,512 Deposits 0 246,804 35,669 21,765 304,238 123 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 (Dollars in millions) Credit Card Consumer Banking Commercial Banking (1) Other (1) Consolidated Total Net interest income $ 7,071 $ 3,322 $ 1,009 $ 83 $ 11,485 Non-interest income (loss) 1,756 223 418 ( 77 ) 2,320 Total net revenue (2) 8,827 3,545 1,427 6 13,805 Provision for credit losses 6,646 1,736 1,283 4 9,669 Non-interest expense 4,177 2,027 837 458 7,499 Loss from continuing operations before income taxes ( 1,996 ) ( 218 ) ( 693 ) ( 456 ) ( 3,363 ) Income tax benefit ( 472 ) ( 52 ) ( 164 ) ( 418 ) ( 1,106 ) Loss from continuing operations, net of tax $ ( 1,524 ) $ ( 166 ) $ ( 529 ) $ ( 38 ) $ ( 2,257 ) Loans held for investment $ 107,310 $ 66,712 $ 77,490 $ 0 $ 251,512 Deposits 0 246,804 35,669 21,765 304,238 __________ (1) Some of our commercial investments generate tax-exempt income, tax credits or other tax benefits. Accordingly, we present our Commercial Banking revenue and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated using the federal statutory tax rate of 21% and state taxes where applicable, with offsetting reductions to the Other category. (2) Total net revenue was reduced by $ 175 million and $ 355 million in the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, and $ 318 million and $ 707 million in the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively, for credit card finance charges and fees charged off as uncollectible. Revenue from Contracts with Customers The majority of our revenue from contracts with customers consists of interchange fees, service charges and other customer-related fees, and other contract revenue. Interchange fees are primarily from our Credit Card business and are recognized upon settlement with the interchange networks, net of rewards earned by customers. Service charges and other customer-related fees within our Consumer Banking business are primarily related to fees earned on consumer deposit accounts for account maintenance and various transaction-based services such as overdrafts and Automated teller machine ( ATM ) usage. Service charges and other customer-related fees within our Commercial Banking business are mostly related to fees earned on treasury management and capital markets services. Other contract revenue in our Credit Card business consists primarily of revenue from our partnership arrangements. Other contract revenue in our Consumer Banking business consists primarily of revenue earned on certain marketing and promotional events from our auto dealers. Revenue from contracts with customers is included in non-interest income in our consolidated statements of income. The following table presents revenue from contracts with customers and a reconciliation to non-interest income by business segment for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020.

(2) Interchange fees are presented net of customer reward expenses . 125 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents NOTE 13 COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES, GUARANTEES AND OTHERS Commitments to Lend Our unfunded lending commitments primarily consist of credit card lines, loan commitments to customers of both our Commercial Banking and Consumer Banking businesses, as well as standby and commercial letters of credit. These commitments, other than credit card lines, are legally binding conditional agreements that have fixed expirations or termination dates and specified interest rates and purposes. The contractual amount of these commitments represents the maximum possible credit risk to us should the counterparty draw upon the commitment. We generally manage the potential risk of unfunded lending commitments by limiting the total amount of arrangements, monitoring the size and maturity structure of these portfolios and applying the same credit standards for all of our credit activities. For unused credit card lines, we have not experienced and do not anticipate that all of our customers will access their entire available line at any given point in time. Commitments to extend credit other than credit card lines generally require customers to maintain certain credit standards. Collateral requirements and loan-to-value ( LTV ) ratios are the same as those for funded transactions and are established based on management credit assessment of the customer. These commitments may expire without being drawn upon; therefore, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future funding requirements. We also issue letters of credit, such as financial standby, performance standby and commercial letters of credit, to meet the financing needs of our customers. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party in a borrowing arrangement. Commercial letters of credit are short-term commitments issued primarily to facilitate trade finance activities for customers and are generally collateralized by the goods being shipped to the customer. These collateral requirements are similar to those for funded transactions and are established based on management credit assessment of the customer. Management conducts regular reviews of all outstanding letters of credit and the results of these reviews are considered in assessing the adequacy of reserves for unfunded lending commitments. The following table presents the contractual amount and carrying value of our unfunded lending commitments as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The carrying value represents our reserve and deferred revenue on legally binding commitments. Table 13.1: Unfunded Lending Commitments Contractual Amount Carrying Value (Dollars in millions) June 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 June 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Credit card lines $ 354,098 $ 349,594 N/A N/A Other loan commitments (1) 38,922 35,836 $ 120 $ 144 Standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit (2) 1,290 1,302 27 32 Total unfunded lending commitments $ 394,310 $ 386,732 $ 147 $ 176 __________ (1) Includes $ 2.6 billion and $ 1.8 billion of advised lines of credit as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. (2) These financial guarantees have expiration dates that range from 2021 to 2023 as of June 30, 2021. Loss Sharing Agreements Within our Commercial Banking business, we originate multifamily commercial real estate loans with the intent to sell them to the GSEs. We enter into loss sharing agreements with the GSEs upon the sale of the loans. Beginning January 1, 2020, we elected the fair value option on new loss sharing agreements. Unrealized gains and losses are recorded in other non-interest income in our consolidated statements of income. For those loss sharing agreements entered into as of and prior to December 31, 2019, we amortize the liability recorded at inception into non-interest income as we are released from risk of payment under the loss sharing agreement and record our estimate of expected credit losses each period in provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of income. The liability recognized on our consolidated balance sheets for these loss sharing agreements was $ 93 million and $ 97 million as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. See Note 4 Allowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments for more information related to our credit card partnership loss sharing arrangements. 126 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Litigation In accordance with the current accounting standards for loss contingencies, we establish reserves for litigation-related matters that arise from the ordinary course of our business activities when it is probable that a loss associated with a claim or proceeding has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. None of the amounts we currently have recorded individually or in the aggregate are considered to be material to our financial condition. Litigation claims and proceedings of all types are subject to many uncertain factors that generally cannot be predicted with assurance. Below we provide a description of potentially material legal proceedings and claims. For some of the matters disclosed below, we are able to estimate reasonably possible losses above existing reserves, and for other disclosed matters, such an estimate is not possible at this time. For those matters below where an estimate is possible, management currently estimates the reasonably possible future losses beyond our reserves as of June 30, 2021 are approximately $ 250 million. Our reserve and reasonably possible loss estimates involve considerable judgment and reflect that there is still significant uncertainty regarding numerous factors that may impact the ultimate loss levels. Notwithstanding, our attempt to estimate a reasonably possible range of loss beyond our current accrual levels for some litigation matters based on current information, it is possible that actual future losses will exceed both the current accrual level and the range of reasonably possible losses disclosed here. Given the inherent uncertainties involved in these matters, especially those involving governmental agencies, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters, there is significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability we may incur from these litigation matters and an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period. Interchange In 2005, a putative class of retail merchants filed antitrust lawsuits against MasterCard and Visa and several issuing banks, including Capital One, seeking both injunctive relief and monetary damages for an alleged conspiracy by defendants to fix the level of interchange fees. Other merchants have asserted similar claims in separate lawsuits, and while these separate cases did not name any issuing banks, Visa, MasterCard and issuers, including Capital One, have entered settlement and judgment sharing agreements allocating the liabilities of any judgment or settlement arising from all interchange-related cases. The lawsuits were consolidated before the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York for certain purposes and were settled in 2012. The class settlement, however, was invalidated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in June 2016, and the suit was bifurcated into separate class actions seeking injunctive and monetary relief, respectively. In addition, numerous merchant groups opted out of the 2012 settlement and have pursued their own claims. The claims by the injunctive relief class have not been resolved, but the settlement of $ 5.5 billion for the monetary damages class received final approval from the trial court, and has been appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Visa and MasterCard have also settled a number of the opt-out cases, which required non-material payments from issuing banks, including Capital One. Visa created a litigation escrow account following its initial public offering of stock in 2008 that funds settlements for its member banks, and any settlements related to MasterCard-allocated losses have either already been paid or are reflected in our reserves. Cybersecurity Incident On July 29, 2019, we announced that on March 22 and 23, 2019 an outside individual gained unauthorized access to our systems. This individual obtained certain types of personal information relating to people who had applied for our credit card products and to our credit card customers (the Cybersecurity Incident ). As a result of the Cybersecurity Incident, we are subject to numerous legal proceedings and other inquiries and could be the subject of additional proceedings and inquiries in the future. Consumer class actions . We were named as a defendant in approximately 74 putative consumer class action cases ( 61 in U.S. federal courts and 13 in Canadian courts) alleging harm from the Cybersecurity Incident and seeking various remedies, including monetary and injunctive relief. The lawsuits allege breach of contract, negligence, violations of various privacy laws and a variety of other legal causes of action. The U.S. consumer class actions have been consolidated for pretrial proceedings before a multi-district litigation ( MDL ) panel in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Alexandria Division, where the remaining 29 consumer class actions are currently pending. In the third quarter of 2020, the MDL court denied in part and granted in part Capital One motion to dismiss and permitted pretrial discovery to continue. 127 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Securities class action . The Company and certain officers have also been named as defendants in a putative class action pending in the MDL alleging violations of certain federal securities laws in connection with statements and alleged omissions in securities filings relating to our information security standards and practices. The complaint seeks certification of a class of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired Capital One securities from July 23, 2015 to July 29, 2019, as well as unspecified monetary damages, costs and other relief. Governmental inquiries . We have received inquiries and requests for information relating to the Cybersecurity Incident from Congress, federal regulators, relevant Canadian regulators, the Department of Justice, and the offices of approximately fourteen state Attorneys General. We are cooperating with these offices and responding to their inquiries. In August 2020, we entered into consent orders with the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) resulting from regulatory reviews of the Cybersecurity Incident and relating to ongoing enhancements of our cybersecurity and operational risk management processes. We paid an $ 80 million penalty to the U.S. Treasury as part of the OCC agreement. The Federal Reserve agreement did not contain a monetary penalty. Taxi Medallion Finance Investigations Beginning in 2019, we have received subpoenas from the New York Attorney General office and from the U.S. Attorney Office for the Southern District of New York, Civil and Criminal Divisions, relating to investigations of the taxi medallion finance industry we exited beginning in 2015. The subpoenas seek, among other things, information regarding our lending counterparties and practices. We are cooperating with these investigations. U.K. PPI Litigation In the U.K., we previously sold payment protection insurance ( PPI ). For several years leading up to the claims submission deadline of August 29, 2019 (as set by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority), we received customer complaints and regulatory claims relating to PPI. As of the first quarter of 2021, COEP has materially resolved the PPI complaints and regulatory claims received prior to the deadline. Some of the claimants in the U.K. PPI regulatory claims process have subsequently initiated legal proceedings, seeking additional redress. We are responding to these proceedings as we receive them. Other Pending and Threatened Litigation In addition, we are commonly subject to various pending and threatened legal actions relating to the conduct of our normal business activities. In the opinion of management, the ultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising out of all such other pending or threatened legal actions is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial position or our results of operations. 128 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk For a discussion of the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, see MD&A Market Risk Profile. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Overview We are required under applicable laws and regulations to maintain controls and procedures, which include disclosure controls and procedures as well as internal control over financial reporting, as further described below. (a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures refer to controls and other procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our financial reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding our required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and we must apply judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ), our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of June 30, 2021, the end of the period covered by this Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2021, at a reasonable level of assurance, in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting information required to be disclosed within the time periods specified by the SEC rules and forms. (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We regularly review our disclosure controls and procedures and make changes intended to ensure the quality of our financial reporting. There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred in the second quarter of 2021 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company internal control over financial reporting. 129 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.
