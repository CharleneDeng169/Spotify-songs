(Unaudited) 1. Basis of Presentation These consolidated financial statements are unaudited; however, in the opinion of management, these statements reflect all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the periods reported. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature unless disclosed otherwise. These consolidated financial statements, including notes, have been prepared in accordance with the applicable rules of the SEC and do not include all of the information and disclosures required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The results of operations for the third quarter and first nine months of 2021 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. 2. Accounting Standards No accounting standards were adopted in the third quarter or first nine months of 2021 that had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 3. Income (loss) and Dividends per Common Share Basic income (loss) per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted income (loss) per share assumes exercise of stock options in all periods, provided the effect is not antidilutive. The per share calculations below exclude 4 million of stock options for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 6 million of stock options for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 that were antidilutive.

Revenues The majority of our revenues are derived from the sale of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas under spot and term agreements with our customers in the United States and Equatorial Guinea. As of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, receivables from contracts with customers, included in receivables, less reserves were $ 900 million and $ 572 million, respectively. The following tables present our revenues from contracts with customers disaggregated by product type and geographic areas for the three and nine months ended September 30: 8 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) United States Three Months Ended September 30, 2021 (In millions) Eagle Ford Bakken Oklahoma Northern Delaware Other U.S. Total Crude oil and condensate $ 391 $ 425 $ 74 $ 75 $ 19 $ 984 Natural gas liquids 50 63 53 12 5 183 Natural gas 38 29 62 12 3 144 Other 2 62 64 Revenues from contracts with customers $ 481 $ 517 $ 189 $ 99 $ 89 $ 1,375 Three Months Ended September 30, 2020 (In millions) Eagle Ford Bakken Oklahoma Northern Delaware Other U.S. Total Crude oil and condensate $ 190 $ 230 $ 65 $ 53 $ 14 $ 552 Natural gas liquids 22 15 28 7 1 73 Natural gas 18 9 33 6 3 69 Other 1 27 28 Revenues from contracts with customers $ 231 $ 254 $ 126 $ 66 $ 45 $ 722 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 (In millions) Eagle Ford Bakken Oklahoma Northern Delaware Other U.S. Total Crude oil and condensate $ 1,003 $ 1,208 $ 206 $ 229 $ 65 $ 2,711 Natural gas liquids 109 152 127 32 10 430 Natural gas 114 71 212 42 11 450 Other 6 99 105 Revenues from contracts with customers $ 1,232 $ 1,431 $ 545 $ 303 $ 185 $ 3,696 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 (In millions) Eagle Ford Bakken Oklahoma Northern Delaware Other U.S. Total Crude oil and condensate $ 639 $ 707 $ 181 $ 160 $ 54 $ 1,741 Natural gas liquids 53 28 62 14 4 161 Natural gas 62 22 86 13 7 190 Other 4 58 62 Revenues from contracts with customers $ 758 $ 757 $ 329 $ 187 $ 123 $ 2,154 International (E.G.)

Segment Information We have two reportable operating segments. Both of these segments are organized and managed based upon geographic location and the nature of the products and services offered. United States ( U.S. ) explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas in the United States International ( Int l ) explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas outside of the United States as well as produces and markets products manufactured from natural gas, such as LNG and methanol, in Equatorial Guinea ( E.G. ) Segment income represents income that excludes certain items not allocated to our operating segments, net of income taxes. A portion of our corporate and operations general and administrative support costs are not allocated to the operating segments. These unallocated costs primarily consist of employment costs (including pension effects), professional services, facilities and other costs associated with corporate and operations support activities. Additionally, items which affect comparability such as: gains or losses on dispositions, impairments of proved and certain unproved properties, goodwill, and equity method investments, unrealized gains or losses on commodity and interest rate derivative instruments, effects of pension settlements and curtailments or other items (as determined by the chief operating decision maker ( CODM )) are not allocated to operating segments.

Income Taxes Effective Tax Rate The effective income tax rate is influenced by a variety of factors including the geographic and functional sources of income and the relative magnitude of these sources of income. The difference between the total provision and the sum of the amounts allocated to segments is reported in the Not Allocated to Segments column of the tables in Note 5 . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, our effective income tax rates were as follows: Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Effective income tax rate 2 % ( 2 ) % 7 % 1 % Our effective income tax rate was different from our U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 as a result of the income mix of our U.S. and E.G. operations, including the income mix within E.G. between equity method investees and subsidiaries. At September 30, 2021, we have a full valuation allowance on net federal deferred tax assets in the U.S., which results in no federal deferred tax expense or benefit on current year U.S. activity. We intend to continue a full valuation allowance on these deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of the allowance. However, if current commodity prices are sustained and absent any additional objective negative evidence, we expect it is reasonably possible that sufficient positive evidence will exist within the next 12 months to adjust our current valuation allowance position. Exact timing and amount of the adjustment to the valuation allowance is unknown as this time. 7. Credit Losses The majority of our receivables are from purchasers of commodities or joint interest owners in properties we operate, both of which are recorded at estimated or invoiced amounts and do not bear interest. The majority of these receivables have payment terms of 30 days or less. At the end of each reporting period, we assess the collectability of our receivables and estimate the expected credit losses using historical data, current market conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions and other data as deemed appropriate. Changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts balance were as follows: (In millions) September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Beginning balance as of January 1 $ 22 $ 11 Cumulative-effect adjustment 12 Current period provision (a) 1 22 Current period write offs ( 1 ) ( 13 ) Recoveries of amounts previously reserved ( 3 ) ( 10 ) Ending balance $ 19 $ 22 (a) As of December 31, 2020, the current period provision consisted of $ 10 million in joint interest receivables and $ 12 million in trade receivables. 8. Inventories Crude oil and natural gas are recorded at weighted average cost and carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Supplies and other items consist principally of tubular goods and equipment which are valued at weighted average cost and reviewed periodically for obsolescence or impairment when market conditions indicate. (In millions) September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Crude oil and natural gas $ 13 $ 10 Supplies and other items 64 66 Inventories $ 77 $ 76 14 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 9. Property, Plant and Equipment (In millions) September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 United States $ 14,317 $ 15,156 International 364 414 Corporate 53 68 Net property, plant and equipment $ 14,734 $ 15,638 As of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, we had $ 125 million and $ 98 million , respectively, of e xploratory well costs capitalized greater than one year related to suspended wells. Management believes these wells exhibit sufficient quantities of hydrocarbons to justify potential development. The vast majority of the suspended wells require completion activities and installation of infrastructure in order to classify the reserves as proved. During the third quarter of 2021, we recorded $ 12 million of dry well costs associated with drilled and uncompleted exploratory wells, primarily in the Permian. 10. Impairments The following table summarizes impairment charges of proved properties, goodwill and equity method investments and their corresponding fair values. Three Months Ended September 30, 2021 2020 (In millions) Fair Value Impairment Fair Value Impairment Long-lived assets held for use $ $ 5 $ $ 1 Asset retirement costs of long-lived assets 8 Equity method investment $ $ $ 23 $ 18 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 2020 (In millions) Fair Value Impairment Fair Value Impairment Long-lived assets held for use $ $ 30 $ $ 3 Asset retirement costs of long-lived assets 30 Goodwill 95 Equity method investment $ $ $ 119 $ 170 2021 During the second quarter of 2021, we recorded an impairment expense of $ 24 million associated with two central facilities located in Eagle Ford. Decommissioning activities commenced during the second quarter, which included the re-routing of existing wells. During the third quarter of 2021, we recorded an impairment expense of $ 5 million associated with our interests in outside operated conventional assets located in New Mexico. During the nine months ended September 30, 2021, we also recognized an incremental $ 30 million of impairment expense associated with an increase in the estimated future decommissioning costs of certain non-producing wells, pipelines and production facilities for previously divested offshore assets located in the Gulf of Mexico. In a prior reporting period, we recorded a $ 7 million liability in our consolidated balance sheet associated with these assets, thereby increasing the total recognized asset retirement obligation to $ 37 million as of September 30, 2021. See Note 11 and Note 23 for further information. The combined effects of these items were recorded within the Impairments line item within our consolidated statements of income. 2020 Impairments for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 include charges recognized for our equity method investments of $ 170 million. During the second and third quarters of 2020, the continuation of the depressed commodity prices, along with a reduction of our long-term price forecasts of a gas index in which one of our equity method investees transacts, caused us to perform a review of one of our equity method investments. Our review concluded that a loss of our investment value in one of our equity method investees was other than temporary and we recorded impairments of $ 152 15 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) million in the second quarter of 2020 and an additional $ 18 million in the third quarter of 2020. The impairments of our equity method investments were recognized in income (loss) from equity method investments in our consolidated statements of income. Additionally, the impairments caused us to incur a basis differential between the net book value of our investment and the amount of our underlying share of equity in the investee net assets. This differential is being accreted into income over the remaining useful life of the investee primary assets. Impairments for the first nine months of 2020 also included $ 95 million of goodwill impairment in the International reporting unit. See Note 13 for further information . 11. Asset Retirement Obligations Asset retirement obligations primarily consist of estimated costs to remove, dismantle and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations. Changes in asset retirement obligations were as follows: September 30, (In millions) 2021 2020 Beginning balance as of January 1 $ 254 $ 255 Incurred liabilities, including acquisitions 9 3 Settled liabilities, including dispositions ( 3 ) ( 11 ) Accretion expense (included in depreciation, depletion and amortization) 9 9 Revisions of estimates 40 ( 8 ) Ending balance as of September 30, total $ 309 $ 248 Ending balance as of September 30, short-term $ 23 $ 12 In the first nine months of 2021, we had revisions of estimates totaling $ 37 million related to anticipated costs for decommissioning certain wells, pipelines and production facilities for previously divested offshore non-producing long-lived assets located in the Gulf of Mexico. As of September 30, 2021, $ 14 million of these Gulf of Mexico related revisions of estimates were classified as short-term. See Note 23 for further information. Of the $ 37 million, approximately $ 30 million was recognized as impairment expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2021. See Note 10 for further information. 12. Leases Lessee Balance sheet information related to right-of-use ( ROU ) assets and lease liabilities was as follows: (In millions) Balance Sheet Location: September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 ROU assets: Operating leases Other noncurrent assets $ 74 $ 133 Finance leases Other noncurrent assets 35 Total ROU assets $ 109 $ 133 Lease liabilities: Current liabilities Operating leases Other current liabilities $ 44 $ 70 Finance leases Other current liabilities 5 Noncurrent liabilities Operating leases Deferred credits and other liabilities 34 67 Finance leases Deferred credits and other liabilities 30 Total Lease liabilities $ 113 $ 137 16 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Operating Leases We enter into various lease agreements to support our operations including drilling rigs, well fracturing equipment, compressors, buildings, aircraft, vessels, vehicles and miscellaneous field equipment. We primarily act as a lessee in these transactions and the majority of our existing leases are classified as either short-term or long-term operating leases. Finance Leases In 2018, we signed an agreement with an owner/lessor to construct and lease a new build-to-suit office building in Houston, Texas . As of September 30, 2021, we estimate that project costs total approximately $ 302 million, including land acquisition and construction costs. The initial lease term is five years and commenced in late September 2021 after the new Houston office was ready for occupancy. In the third quarter of 2021, we recorded a $ 32 million ROU asset and corresponding lease liability associated with the building, which was classified as a finance lease. At the end of the initial lease term, we can negotiate to extend the lease term for an additional five years , subject to the approval of the participants; purchase the property subject to certain terms and conditions; or remarket the property to an unrelated third party. The lease contains a residual value guarantee of 100 % of the total acquisition and construction costs. The weighted-average remaining lease term is five years and the discount rate is 2.25 %. Lessor Our wholly owned subsidiary, Marathon E.G. Production Limited, is a lessor for residential housing in E.G., which is occupied by EGHoldings, a related party equity method investee see Note 22 . The lease was classified as an operating lease and expires in 2024, with a lessee option to extend through 2034. Lease payments are fixed for the entire duration of the agreement at approximately $ 6 million per year. Our lease income is reported in other income in our consolidated statements of income for all periods presented. The undiscounted cash flows to be received under this lease agreement are summarized below. (In millions) Operating Lease Future Cash Receipts 2021 $ 2 2022 6 2023 6 2024 6 2025 6 Thereafter 56 Total undiscounted cash flows $ 82 13. Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or between annual tests when events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill may have been reduced below its carrying value. During the first quarter of 2020, a global pandemic caused a substantial deterioration in the worldwide demand of hydrocarbons. The commensurate decline in our market capitalization indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the International reporting unit was less than its carrying value. We estimated the fair value of our International reporting unit using a combination of market and income approaches. The market approach referenced observable inputs specific to us and our industry, such as the price of our common equity, our enterprise value and valuation multiples of us and peers from the investor analyst community. The income approach utilized discounted cash flows, which were based on forecasted assumptions. These valuation methodologies represent Level 3 fair value measurements. Based on the results, we concluded our goodwill was fully impaired, and recorded an impairment of $ 95 million in the consolidated statements of income for the first quarter of 2020. This represented the entirety of our goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet. 14. Derivatives For further information regarding the fair value measurement of derivative instruments, see Note 15 . All of our commodity derivatives are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements under which we report net amounts. 17 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) The following tables present the gross fair values of derivative instruments and the reported net amounts along with where they appear on the consolidated balance sheets.

These derivatives consist of three-way collars, two-way collars, fixed price swaps and NYMEX roll basis swaps. Three-way collars consist of a sold call (ceiling), a purchased put (floor) and a sold put. The ceiling price is the maximum we will receive for the contract volumes; the floor is the minimum price we will receive, unless the market price falls below the sold put strike price. In this case, we receive the NYMEX WTI price plus the difference between the floor and the sold put price. Two-way collars only consist of a sold call (ceiling) and a purchased put (floor). 18 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) The following table sets forth outstanding derivative contracts as of September 30, 2021, and the weighted average prices for those contracts: 2021 2022 Fourth Quarter First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Crude Oil NYMEX WTI Three-Way Collars Volume (Bbls/day) 40,000 30,000 30,000 10,000 10,000 Weighted average price per Bbl: Ceiling $ 78.05 $ 89.12 $ 89.12 $ 88.44 $ 88.44 Floor $ 50.00 $ 50.00 $ 50.00 $ 50.00 $ 50.00 Sold put $ 40.00 $ 40.00 $ 40.00 $ 40.00 $ 40.00 NYMEX WTI Two-Way Collars Volume (Bbls/day) 40,000 Weighted average price per Bbl: Ceiling $ 58.92 $ $ $ $ Floor $ 39.25 $ $ $ $ NYMEX Roll Basis Swaps Volume (Bbls/day) 40,000 45,000 45,000 45,000 45,000 Weighted average price per Bbl $ 1.15 $ 0.56 $ 0.56 $ 0.56 $ 0.56 Natural Gas Henry Hub ( HH ) Two-Way Collars Volume (MMBtu/day) 200,000 Weighted average price per MMBtu: Ceiling $ 3.05 $ $ $ $ Floor $ 2.50 $ $ $ $ HH Three-Way Collars Volume (MMBtu/day) 50,000 Weighted average price per MMBtu: Ceiling $ $ 5.14 $ $ $ Floor $ $ 3.60 $ $ $ Sold Put $ $ 2.60 $ $ $ HH Fixed Price Swaps Volume (MMBtu/day) 50,000 Weighted average price per MMBtu $ 2.88 $ $ $ $ NGL Fixed Price Ethane Swaps (a) Volume (Bbls/day) 5,000 Weighted average price per Bbl $ 10.92 $ $ $ $ Fixed Price Propane Swaps (b) Volume (Bbls/day) 5,000 Weighted average price per Bbl $ 23.19 $ $ $ $ (a) The fixed price ethane swap is priced at OPIS Mont Belvieu Purity Ethane.

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (In millions) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Unrealized gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net $ 27 $ ( 36 ) $ ( 130 ) $ 39 Realized gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net (a) $ ( 106 ) $ 35 $ ( 268 ) $ 92 (a) During the third quarter and first nine months of 2021, net cash paid for settled derivative positions was $ 108 million and $ 203 million, respectively. During the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, net cash settled derivative positions was $ 15 million paid and $ 76 million received, respectively. Interest Rate Swaps During 2020, we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps to hedge the variations in cash flows related to fluctuations in the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) benchmark interest rate related to forecasted interest payments of a future d ebt issuance in 2022. Each respective derivative contract can be tied to an anticipated underlying dollar notional amount. During the third quarter of 2020, we de-designated these forward starting interest rate swaps previously designated as cash flow hedges. In the first quarter of 2021, the net deferred loss of $ 2 million in accumulated other comprehensive income related to these de-designated forward starting interest rate swaps was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings as an adjustment to net interest, as we fully redeemed the remainder of our outstanding 2022 notes in April 2021. We recorded a $ 5 million mark-to-market gain and a $ 24 million mark-to-market gain within net interest to reflect the change in value of these interest rate swaps during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively. During 2020, we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $ 350 million to hedge variations in cash flows arising from fluctuations in the LIBOR benchmark interest rate related to forecasted interest payments of a future debt issuance in 2025. The expected proceeds of the future debt issuance were intended to refinance the $ 900 million 3.85 % Senior Notes due 2025 ( 2025 Notes ). During the second quarter of 2021, we de-designated these forward starting interest rate swaps previously designated as cash flow hedges because we no longer planned to refinance the 2025 Notes. In the second quarter of 2021, we reclassified the $ 31 million cumulative gain related to these hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings as an adjustment to net interest. In September 2021, we fully redeemed these 2025 Notes. See Note 16 for further details. We recorded a $ 3 million mark-to-market gain and a $ 34 million mark-to-market gain within net interest to reflect the change in value of these interest rate swaps during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. In addition, during the second quarter of 2021, we de-designated $ 25 million of the $ 320 million Houston office cash flow hedges (discussed further in the Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow Hedges section below), as the construction cost budget estimate was reduced. The $ 1 million loss of these de-designated cash flow hedges as of June 30, 2021 was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings as an adjustment to net interest. The mark-to-market activity within net interest to reflect the change in value of these interest rate swaps during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 was immaterial. The following table presents, by maturity date, information about our de-designated forward starting interest rate swap agreements, including the rate. We have the discretion to liquidate the positions should we choose.

Although lease commencement began in September 2021, our first cash lease payment will be February 2022 and the first settlement date for the interest rate swap will be in January 2022. During the second quarter of 2021, we de-designated $ 25 million of these hedges as the construction cost budget estimate associated with the project was reduced. The last swap will mature in September 2026. As of September 30, 2021, we expect to reclassify $ 3 million from accumulated other comprehensive income into the income statement over the next twelve months. See Note 12 for further details regarding the lease of the new Houston office. The following table presents, by maturity date, information about our interest rate swap agreements, including the weighted average LIBOR-based, fixed rate.

See Note 14 . Commodity derivatives include three-way collars, two-way collars, fixed price swaps, basis swaps and NYMEX roll basis swaps. These instruments are measured at fair value using either a Black-Scholes or a modified Black-Scholes Model. For 21 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) swaps, inputs to the models include only commodity prices and interest rates and are categorized as Level 1 because all assumptions and inputs are observable in active markets throughout the term of the instruments. For three-way collars and two-way collars, inputs to the models include commodity prices and implied volatility and are categorized as Level 2 because predominantly all assumptions and inputs are observable in active markets throughout the term of the instruments. The forward starting interest rate swaps are measured at fair value with a market approach using actionable broker quotes, which are Level 2 inputs. See Note 14 for detail on the forward starting interest rate swaps. Fair Value Estimates Goodwill See Note 13 for detail information relating to goodwill. Fair Values Nonrecurring See Note 10 for detail on our fair values related to impairments. Fair Values Financial Instruments Our current assets and liabilities include financial instruments, the most significant of which are receivables, the current portion of our long-term debt and payables. We believe the carrying values of our receivables and payables approximate fair value. Our fair value assessment incorporates a variety of considerations, including (1) the short-term duration of the instruments, (2) our credit rating and (3) our historical incurrence of and expected future insignificant bad debt expense, which includes an evaluation of counterparty credit risk. The following table summarizes financial instruments, excluding receivables, payables and derivative financial instruments, and their reported fair values by individual balance sheet line item at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 (In millions) Fair Value Carrying Amount Fair Value Carrying Amount Financial assets Current assets $ 13 $ 12 $ 4 $ 4 Other noncurrent assets 12 27 24 37 Total financial assets $ 25 $ 39 $ 28 $ 41 Financial liabilities Current liabilities $ 95 $ 128 $ 72 $ 103 Long-term debt, including current portion (a) 4,729 4,033 6,077 5,431 Deferred credits and other liabilities 51 50 82 76 Total financial liabilities $ 4,875 $ 4,211 $ 6,231 $ 5,610 (a) Excludes debt issuance costs. Fair values of our financial assets included in other noncurrent assets, and of our financial liabilities included in other current liabilities and deferred credits and other liabilities, are measured using an income approach and most inputs are internally generated, which results in a Level 3 classification. Estimated future cash flows are discounted using a rate deemed appropriate to obtain the fair value. All of our long-term debt instruments are publicly traded. A market approach, based upon quotes from major financial institutions, which are Level 2 inputs, is used to measure the fair value of our debt. 16. Debt Revolving Credit Facility On June 21, 2021, we executed the sixth amendment to our unsecured revolving credit facility ( Credit Facility ). The primary changes resulting from this amendment are (i) increasing the size of the Credit Facility from $ 3.0 billion to $ 3.1 billion, (ii) extending the maturity of the commitments of certain consenting lenders from May 28, 2023 to June 21, 2024 (with the remaining commitment of a single non-consenting lender to mature on May 28, 2023, at which time the size of the Credit Facility will be reduced to $ 3.0 billion) and (iii) including certain other provisions and revisions, including provisions to 22 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) provide for the eventual replacement of LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate. As of September 30, 2021, we had no borrowings against our Credit Facility. The Credit Facility includes a covenant requiring our total debt to total capitalization ratio not to exceed 65 % as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. In the event of a default, the lenders holding more than half of the commitments may terminate the commitments under the Credit Facility and require the immediate repayment of all outstanding borrowings and the cash collateralization of all outstanding letters of credit under the Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2021, we were in compliance with this covenant with a ratio of 20 %. Debt Redemption On March 30, 2021, we sent an irrevocable notice of redemption to the trustee to fully redeem our outstanding $ 500 million 2.8 % Senior Notes due 2022 ( 2022 Notes ). The 2022 Notes were redeemed on April 29, 2021 and as a result of the settlement, we incurred $ 19 million in costs related to a make-whole provision premium and the write off of unamortized discount and issuance costs. On August 4, 2021, we sent an irrevocable notice of redemption to the trustee to fully redeem our outstanding $ 900 million 3.85 % Senior Notes due 2025 ( 2025 Notes ). The 2025 Notes were redeemed on September 7, 2021 and as a result of the redemption, we incurred $ 102 million in costs related to the make-whole provision premium and the write off of unamortized discount and issuance costs. Long-term debt At September 30, 2021, we had $ 4.0 billion of total long-term debt outstanding. We currently intend to retire our outstanding long-term debt as it matures. Refer to our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a listing of our long-term debt maturities. 17. Stockholders Equity No share repurchases were made under our share repurchases program during the nine months ended September 30, 2021. We did repurchase $ 10 million of shares during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 related to our tax withholding obligation associated with the vesting of employee restricted stock awards. The total remaining share repurchase authorization was $ 1.3 billion at September 30, 2021. Purchases under the program are made at our discretion and may be in either open market transactions, including block purchases, or in privately negotiated transactions using cash on hand, cash generated from operations, or proceeds from potential asset sales. This program may be changed based upon our financial condition or changes in market conditions and is subject to termination prior to completion. Subsequent to the quarter, we resumed our share repurchase program and repurchased approximately $ 200 million of shares of our common stock through November 3, 2021. Effective November 3, 2021, our Board of Directors increased our remaining share repurchase program authorization from $ 1.1 billion to $ 2.5 billion. 23 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 18. Incentive Based Compensation Stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units The following table presents a summary of activity for the first nine months of 2021: Stock Options Restricted Stock & Units Number of Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price Number of Shares & Units Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Outstanding at December 31, 2020 6,014,255 $ 21.00 7,851,754 $ 11.72 Granted $ 2,306,479 $ 11.21 Exercised/Vested ( 384,889 ) $ 7.34 ( 2,992,724 ) $ 12.78 Canceled (a) ( 1,137,109 ) $ 23.10 ( 1,037,911 ) $ 11.78 Outstanding at September 30, 2021 4,492,257 $ 21.64 6,127,598 $ 11.00 (a) Included in canceled are forfeitures related to workforce reductions. Stock-based performance unit awards During the first nine months of 2021, we granted 307,473 stock-based performance units to eligible officers, which are settled in shares. The grant date fair value per unit was $ 18.07 , as calculated using a Monte Carlo valuation model. At the grant date, each unit represents the value of one share of our common stock. These units are settled in shares, and the number of shares of our common stock to be paid is based on the vesting percentage, which can be from zero to 200 % based on performance achieved during the performance period and as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors ( Compensation Committee ). The performance goals are tied to our total shareholder return ( TSR ) as compared to TSR for a group including peer companies, the S&P Energy Index and the S&P 500 Index, which is determined by the Compensation Committee. Also, dividend equivalents accrue during the performance period and would be paid in cash following the end of the performance period based on the amount of dividends credited on shares of our common stock over the performance period multiplied by the number of units that vest. During the first nine months of 2021, we introduced a new type of stock-based performance unit award under the Marathon Oil Corporation 2019 Incentive Compensation Plan and granted 307,473 units to eligible officers, which are settled in cash. At the grant date for these new stock-based performance units, each unit represents the value of one share of our common stock. The benefit amount to be paid is based on the product of (i) the number of units granted, (ii) the vesting percentage, and (iii) the average daily closing price of our common stock during the final 30 calendar days ending on the last trading day of the performance period, subject to the banking feature described below. The vesting percentage can range from zero to 200 %, which is based on performance achieved over a two-year performance period. The performance metric is a predetermined amount of cumulative free cash flow, as defined by the award agreement, generated by the Company over the performance period. The units have a banking feature whereby the stock price valuation and vesting percentage are fixed at no less than 50 %, and then again at 100 %, if achieved during the performance period. Once those milestones are reached, the vesting percentage will not fall below those banked percentage amounts even if cumulative free cash flow subsequently declines during the performance period, subject to the Compensation Committee discretion as described below. The third quarter fair value per unit was $ 27.52 , as calculated by multiplying the estimated vesting percentage by our common stock closing stock price on September 30, 2021. Also, dividend equivalents accrue during the performance period and would be paid in cash following the end of the performance period based on the amount of dividends credited on shares of our common stock over the performance period multiplied by the number of units that vest. As set forth in the award agreement terms, the Compensation Committee retains discretion to reduce the vesting percentage and any bank values and determine free cash flow achievement for these awards. 24 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 19.

Payables to related parties at September 30, 2021 were $ 6 million, with the majority related to EGHoldings and $ 13 million at December 31, 2020, with the majority related to Alba Plant LLC. 23. Commitments and Contingencies In the second quarter of 2019, Marathon E.G. Production Limited ( MEGPL ), a consolidated and wholly owned subsidiary, signed a series of agreements to process third-party Alen Unit gas through existing infrastructure located in Punta Europa, E.G. Our equity method investee, Alba Plant LLC, is also a party to some of the agreements. These agreements require (subject to certain limitations) MEGPL to indemnify the owners of the Alen Unit against injury to Alba Plant LLC personnel and damage to or loss of Alba Plant LLC automobiles, as well as third party claims caused by Alba Plant LLC and certain environmental liabilities arising from certain hydrocarbons in the custody of Alba Plant LLC. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate this obligation as we do not have any history of prior indemnification claims or environmental discharge or contamination. Therefore, we have not recorded a liability with respect to these indemnities since the amount of potential future payments under these indemnification clauses is not determinable. The agreements to process the third-party Alen Unit gas required the execution of third-party guarantees by Marathon Oil Corporation in favor of the Alen Unit owners. Two separate guarantees were executed during the second quarter of 2020; one for a maximum of approximately $ 91 million pertaining to the payment obligations of Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A. and another for a maximum of $ 25 million pertaining to the payment obligations of Alba Plant LLC. Payment by us would be required if any of those entities fails to honor its payment obligations pursuant to the relevant agreements with the owners of the Alen Unit. Certain owners of the Alen Unit, or their affiliates, are also direct or indirect shareholders in Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A. and Alba Plant LLC. Each guarantee expires no later than December 31, 2027. We measured these guarantees at fair value using the net present value of premium payments we expect to receive from our investees. Our liability for these guarantees was approximately $ 4 million as of September 30, 2021, with a corresponding receivable from our investees. Each of Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A. and Equatorial Guinea LNG Train 1, S.A. provided us with a pledge of its receivables as recourse against any payments we may make under the guaranty of Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A. performance. Various groups, including the State of North Dakota and three Indian tribes represented by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, have been involved in a dispute regarding the ownership of certain lands underlying the Missouri River and Little Missouri River. As a result, as of September 30, 2021, we have a $ 126 million current liability in suspended royalty and working interest revenue, including interest, of which $ 115 million was included within accounts payable and $ 11 million related to accrued interest and was included within other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, we have a long-term receivable of $ 24 million for capital and expenses. In January 2020, we received a Notice of Violation from the EPA related to the Clean Air Act. The enforcement action will likely result in monetary sanctions yet-to-be specified and corrective actions, which may increase our development costs, operating costs or both. Given the uncertainty in matters such as these, we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of this matter at this time. However, we believe that any penalties, mitigation costs or corrective actions that may result from this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are a defendant in a number of legal and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business including, but not limited to, royalty claims, contract claims, tax disputes and environmental claims. While the ultimate 27 MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, we may also be subject to retained liabilities with respect to certain divested assets by operation of law. For example, recent historical declines in commodity prices created an environment where there is an increased risk that owners and/or operators of assets purchased from us may no longer be able to satisfy plugging or abandonment obligations that attach to those assets. In that event, due to operation of law, we may be required to assume plugging or abandonment obligations for those assets. Although we have established reserves for such liabilities, we could be required to accrue additional amounts in the future and these amounts could be material. For instance, as the result of the declaration of bankruptcy by a third party that is the indirect successor in title to certain offshore assets that we previously divested, in the first nine months of 2021 we increased our existing reserve to $ 37 million related to the anticipated cost to decommission certain wells, pipelines and production facilities. We no longer own these assets nor are they related to our current operations. Marathon Oil has been named in various lawsuits alleging royalty underpayments in our domestic operations, and plaintiffs in some of these lawsuits are seeking class certification. We intend to vigorously defend ourselves against such claims. Although we have accrued for potential liabilities associated with these lawsuits, those accruals are based on currently available information and involve elements of judgment and significant uncertainties. Accordingly, actual losses may exceed our accruals or we could be required to accrue additional amounts in the future and these amounts could be material. We have incurred and will continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately offset by the prices we receive for our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes. These laws generally provide for control of pollutants released into the environment and require responsible parties to undertake remediation of hazardous waste disposal sites. Penalties may be imposed for noncompliance. At September 30, 2021, accrued liabilities for remediation relating to environmental laws and regulations were not material. It is not presently possible to estimate the ultimate amount of all remediation cost that might be incurred or the penalties that may be imposed. 28 Item 2. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Overview Outlook Operations Market Conditions Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted Cash Flows Liquidity and Capital Resources Environmental Matters and Other Contingencies The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the preceding consolidated financial statements and notes in Item 1 . Executive Overview We are an independent exploration and production company based in Houston, Texas. Our strategy is to deliver competitive and improving corporate level returns by focusing our capital investment in our lower cost, higher margin U.S. resource plays (Eagle Ford in Texas, Bakken in North Dakota, STACK and SCOOP in Oklahoma and Northern Delaware in New Mexico). Our reinvestment rate and capital allocation framework prioritizes free cash flow generation across a wide range of commodity prices to make available significant cash flow for investor-friendly purposes, including return of capital to shareholders and balance sheet enhancement. Keeping our workforce safe, minimizing our environmental impact, strong corporate governance and protecting our balance sheet are foundational to the execution of our strategy. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we leveraged our emergency response protocols and business continuity plans to help manage our operations and workforce. Our workforce worked remotely for a significant period of time since the pandemic began. We implemented a process for a phased return of employees to the office last year and, during April 2021, the majority of our corporate workforce returned to the office. Working remotely did not significantly impact our ability to maintain operations, allowed our field offices to operate without any disruption and did not cause us to incur significant additional expenses. Key highlights include the following: Maintained focus on balance sheet and liquidity At the end of the third quarter 2021, we had approximately $3.6 billion of liquidity, comprised of an undrawn $3.1 billion revolving credit facility and $485 million in cash. We remain investment grade at all three primary rating agencies, with Moody and Fitch recently upgrading their rating outlooks to stable and positive, respectively. In the first nine months of 2021, we generated $2.1 billion of cash provided by operating activities, which substantially funded $1.4 billion of total debt redemption, $772 million of additions to property, plant and equipment and dividends of $94 million. We continued our capital discipline through the third quarter as we are within our full-year capital budget of $1.0 billion. Consistent with our strategy to enhance the balance sheet, in September 2021, we fully redeemed our outstanding $900 million 3.85% Senior Notes due 2025. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements and Liquidity and Capital Resources for further information. Financial and operational results In the third quarter of 2021, U.S. net sales volumes decreased by 5% to 281 mboed, including a 3% reduction in U.S. crude oil net sales volumes compared to the same quarter last year as a result of overall lower drilling and completion activities and natural decline. Our net income per share was $0.23 in the third quarter of 2021 as compared to a net loss per share of $0.40 in the 29 same period last year. Included in our financial results for the current quarter: Revenues from contracts with customers increased $677 million compared to the same quarter last year. We experienced significant increases in realized prices for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas. Net loss on commodity derivatives of $79 million, as compared to a net loss of $1 million in 2020. The increase in derivative losses were a direct result of higher commodity prices. Income from equity method investments of $86 million, an increase of $96 million from the same period in 2020. Our equity method investees realized higher prices in the current quarter whereas the same period in 2020 had lower realized prices and an impairment of $18 million. A loss on the early redemption of debt totaling $102 million, which primarily represents the premium payment for the early redemption. Compensation and ESG Highlights and Initiatives CEO and Board of Director total compensation reduced by approximately 25% with Board compensation mix shifted more toward equity and CEO mix further aligned with broader industry norms. Short-term incentive scorecard for compensation updated to focus on safety, environmental performance, capital efficiency, capital discipline/free cash flow generation and financial/balance sheet strength. Added a 2021 GHG emissions intensity target to short-term incentive scorecard. Adopted a medium-term goal for GHG emissions intensity reduction by 2025. Continued Board of Director refreshment with two Directors added during the first quarter of 2021, reflecting commitment to refreshment, independence, and diversity. Outlook Capital Budget In February 2021, we announced a 2021 capital budget of $1.0 billion, which is effectively a maintenance capital budget. Our maintenance-level capital budget has allowed us to keep total company oil production in 2021 consistent with our fourth quarter 2020 exit rate. Our 2021 capital budget is consistent with our capital allocation framework that prioritizes corporate returns and free cash flow generation over production growth and we expect that strategy to drive our 2022 capital budget. The 2021 capital budget is weighted towards the four U.S. resource plays with approximately 90% allocated to the Eagle Ford and Bakken. Operations The following table presents a summary of our sales volumes for each of our segments. Refer to Results of Operations for a price-volume analysis for each of the segments. Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, Net Sales Volumes 2021 2020 Increase (Decrease) 2021 2020 Increase (Decrease) United States (mboed) 281 297 (5) % 280 314 (11) % International (mboed) 61 71 (14) % 64 79 (19) % Total (mboed) 342 368 (7) % 344 393 (12) % United States Net sales volumes in the segment were lower in the third quarter of 2021 and the first nine months of 2021 as compared to their respective 2020 periods due to lower capital investment, timing of wells to sales, natural decline and midstream downtime. The decrease in capital investment is a direct result of the demand contraction, beginning in 2020, related to the global pandemic. We continue to expect that our planned pace of drilling and completions activity during the remainder of the year will enable us to meet our 2021 production guidance as noted in the preceding Outlook section. The following tables provide additional details regarding net sales volumes, sales mix and operational drilling activity for our significant operations within this segment: 30 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, Net Sales Volumes 2021 2020 Increase (Decrease) 2021 2020 Increase (Decrease) Equivalent Barrels (mboed) Eagle Ford 95 91 4 % 88 104 (15) % Bakken 103 98 5 % 107 103 4 % Oklahoma 55 73 (25) % 54 69 (22) % Northern Delaware 21 27 (22) % 24 29 (17) % Other United States 7 8 (13) % 7 9 (22) % Total United States 281 297 (5) % 280 314 (11) % Three Months Ended September 30, 2021 Sales Mix - U.S. Resource Plays Eagle Ford Bakken Oklahoma Northern Delaware Total Crude oil and condensate 64 % 65 % 21 % 54 % 55 % Natural gas liquids 19 % 22 % 34 % 22 % 23 % Natural gas 17 % 13 % 45 % 24 % 22 % Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, Drilling Activity - U.S. Resource Plays 2021 2020 2021 2020 Gross Operated Eagle Ford: Wells drilled to total depth 23 17 76 58 Wells brought to sales 29 9 99 67 Bakken: Wells drilled to total depth 16 6 55 41 Wells brought to sales 27 8 46 41 Oklahoma: Wells drilled to total depth 9 Wells brought to sales 4 4 13 Northern Delaware: Wells drilled to total depth 15 Wells brought to sales 3 1 3 13 31 International Net sales volumes were lower in the third quarter of 2021 and the first nine months of 2021 as compared to their respective 2020 periods primarily due to natural decline.

Commodity prices declined substantially in the first half of 2020 resulting from demand contraction related to the global pandemic and increased supply following the OPEC decision to increase production. A revised OPEC deal to reduce production was agreed in the early second quarter of 2020 and prices partially recovered through the end of the year. Beginning in December 2020 and continuing through the first nine months of 2021, commodity prices continued to increase due to rising oil demand as COVID-19 vaccination rates and global economic activity increased. Higher commodity prices were also supported by ongoing OPEC petroleum supply limitations and weather events in 2021 that disrupted production. We continue to expect commodity price volatility given the global dynamics of supply and demand that exist in the market. Refe r to Ite m 1A. Risk Factors in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion on how declines in commodity prices could impact us. 32 United States The following table presents our average price realizations and the related benchmarks for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas for the third quarter and first nine months of 2021 and 2020.

Crude oil and condensate Price realizations may differ from benchmarks due to the quality and location of the product. Natural gas liquids The majority of our sales volumes are sold at reference to Mont Belvieu prices. Natural gas A significant portion of our volumes are sold at bid-week prices, or first-of-month indices relative to our producing areas. International (E.G.) The following table presents our average price realizations and the related benchmark for crude oil for the third quarter and first nine months of 2021 and 2020.

Crude oil and condensate Alba field liquids production is primarily condensate. MEGPL and Marathon E.G. International Limited generally sell their share of condensate in relation to the Brent crude benchmark. Alba Plant LLC processes the rich hydrocarbon gas which is supplied by the Alba field under a fixed-price long term contract. Alba Plant LLC extracts NGLs and secondary condensate which is then sold by Alba Plant LLC at market prices, with our share of the revenue reflected in income from equity method investments on the consolidated statements of income. Alba Plant LLC delivers the processed dry natural gas to the Alba Unit Parties for distribution and sale to AMPCO and EG LNG. 33 Natural gas liquids Wet gas is sold to Alba Plant LLC at a fixed-price long term contract resulting in realized prices not tracking market price. Alba Plant LLC extracts and keeps NGLs, which are sold at market price, with our share of income from Alba Plant LLC being reflected in the income from equity method investments on the consolidated statements of income. Natural gas Dry natural gas, processed by Alba Plant LLC on behalf of the Alba Unit Parties is sold by the Alba field to EG LNG and AMPCO at fixed-price long term contracts resulting in realized prices not tracking market price. We derive additional value from the equity investment in our downstream gas processing units EG LNG and AMPCO. EG LNG sells LNG on a market-based long-term contract and AMPCO markets methanol at market prices.

We have multiple crude oil, natural gas and NGL derivative contracts that settle against various indices. We record commodity derivative gains/losses as the index pricing and forward curves change each period. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Income from equity method investments increased $96 million in third quarter of 2021 primarily due to higher price realizations coupled with an impairment of $18 million to an investment in an equity method investee in third quarter of 2020. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for more detail. Production expenses increased $2 million in the third quarter of 2021 versus the same period in 2020. Our U.S. and International segments production expense rate increased due to lower sales volumes from natural decline. The following table provides production expense and production expense rates (expense per boe) for each segment: 34 Three Months Ended September 30, ($ in millions; rate in $ per boe) 2021 2020 Increase (Decrease) 2021 2020 Increase (Decrease) Production Expense and Rate Expense Rate United States $ 119 $ 118 1 % $ 4.59 $ 4.32 6 % International $ 12 $ 11 9 % $ 2.17 $ 1.76 23 % Shipping, handling and other operating increased $36 million in the third quarter of 2021 versus the same period in 2020. As disclosed in our Form 10-K, certain of our processing arrangements with midstream entities are percentage-of-proceeds contracts. We classify the proceeds retained by the midstream companies as shipping and handling cost. The increase in shipping and handling costs of these percentage-of-proceeds contracts coincides with the increase in realized natural gas liquids prices. In addition, higher marketing costs contributed to the increase due to more volumes purchased for resale to satisfy transportation commitments. This was partially offset by higher legal expenses in third quarter of 2020. Exploration expenses include unproved property impairments, dry well costs, geological and geophysical and other costs. The increase in unproved property impairments were primarily driven by our decision not to drill certain leases related to resource exploration in the third quarter of 2021. The dry well costs includes the write-off of suspended costs associated with drilled and uncompleted wells primarily in Permian in the third quarter of 2021. The following table summarizes the components of exploration expenses: Three Months Ended September 30, (In millions) 2021 2020 Increase (Decrease) Exploration Expenses Unproved property impairments $ 48 $ 23 109 % Dry well costs 14 % Geological and geophysical 2 (100) % Other 1 2 (50) % Total exploration expenses $ 63 $ 27 133 % Depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased $32 million in the third quarter of 2021 primarily as a result of lower sales volumes. Our segments apply the units-of-production method to the majority of their assets, including capitalized asset retirement costs; therefore volumes have an impact on DD&A expense. The DD&A rate (expense per boe) is impacted by field-level changes in reserves, capitalized costs and sales volume mix between fields. The following table provides DD&A expense and DD&A expense rates for each segment: Three Months Ended September 30, ($ in millions; rate in $ per boe) 2021 2020 Increase (Decrease) 2021 2020 Increase (Decrease) DD&A Expense and Rate Expense Rate United States $ 499 $ 530 (6) % $ 19.29 $ 19.39 (1) % International $ 17 $ 19 (11) % $ 3.12 $ 2.89 8 % Impairments increased $12 million in the third quarter of 2021 primarily due to an $8 million impairment related to an increase in the estimated future decommissioning costs of certain non-producing wells, pipelines and production facilities and a $5 million impairment associated with our interests in outside operated conventional assets located in New Mexico. See Note 10 , Note 11 , and Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for more detail. Taxes other than income include production, severance and ad valorem taxes, primarily in the U.S., which tend to increase or decrease in relation to revenue and sales volumes. Taxes other than income increased $39 million primarily due to higher price realizations in the U.S. segment in the third quarter of 2021. General and administrative expenses increased $17 million in the third quarter of 2021 as a result of increases in accruals for variable employee compensation plans, commensurate with our improved financial performance. 35 Loss on early extinguishment of debt increased $102 million due to make-whole call provisions paid upon redemption of $900 million in senior unsecured notes in the third quarter of 2021. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail. Provision (benefit) for income taxes reflects an effective income tax rate of 2% in the third quarter of 2021, as compared to an effective income tax rate of (2)% in the same period in 2020. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion concerning the rate changes. Segment Income Segment income represents income that excludes certain items not allocated to our operating segments, net of income taxes. A portion of our corporate and operations general and administrative support costs are not allocated to the operating segments. These unallocated costs primarily consist of employment costs (including pension effects), professional services, facilities and other costs associated with corporate and operations support activities. Additionally, items which affect comparability such as: gains or losses on dispositions, impairments of proved and certain unproved properties, goodwill and equity method investments, unrealized gains or losses on commodity and interest rate derivative instruments, effects of pension settlements and curtailments or other items (as determined by the CODM) are not allocated to operating segments. The following table reconciles segment income (loss) to net income (loss): Three Months Ended September 30, (In millions) 2021 2020 United States $ 305 $ (135) International 93 8 Segment income (loss) 398 (127) Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes (214) (190) Net income (loss) $ 184 $ (317) United States segment income (loss) in the third quarter of 2021 was $305 million of income versus a $135 million loss for the same period in 2020. The increase in income was primarily due to higher price realizations and lower DD&A expenses. These favorable changes were partially offset by higher realized losses on commodity derivatives, production taxes and shipping and handling in the third quarter of 2021. International segment income (loss) in the third quarter of 2021 was $93 million of income versus $8 million of income for the same period in 2020, primarily due to higher price realizations that yielded positive effects on both consolidated operations and our equity method investees in the third quarter of 2021. Results of Operations Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 vs. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 Revenues from contracts with customers are presented by segment in the table below: Nine Months Ended September 30, (In millions) 2021 2020 Revenues from contracts with customers United States $ 3,696 $ 2,154 International 173 121 Segment revenues from contracts with customers $ 3,869 $ 2,275 Below is a price/volume analysis for each segment. Refer to Operations and Market Conditions for additional detail related to our net sales volumes and average price realizations. 36 Increase (Decrease) Related to (In millions) Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 Price Realizations Net Sales Volumes Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 United States Price/Volume Analysis Crude oil and condensate $ 1,741 $ 1,216 $ (246) $ 2,711 Natural gas liquids 161 272 (3) 430 Natural gas 190 283 (23) 450 Other sales 62 105 Total $ 2,154 $ 3,696 International Price/Volume Analysis Crude oil and condensate $ 96 $ 75 $ (20) $ 151 Natural gas liquids 3 (1) 2 Natural gas 22 (4) 18 Other sales 2 Total $ 121 $ 173 Net gain (loss) on commodity derivatives in the first nine months of 2021 was a loss of $398 million, compared to a net gain of $131 million for the same period in 2020. We have multiple crude oil, natural gas and NGL derivative contracts that settle against various indices. We record commodity derivative gains/losses as the index pricing and forward curves change each period. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Income (loss) from equity method investments increased $353 million for the first nine months of 2021. We recognized impairments of $170 million related to an investment in an equity method investee in the first nine months of 2020. Additionally, we experienced higher price realizations in the first nine months of 2021. Production expenses for the first nine months of 2021 decreased by $40 million compared to the same period in 2020, primarily as a result of the U.S. segment lower operational costs and continued cost management, specifically staffing and contract labor. The following table provides production expense and production expense rates for each segment: Nine Months Ended September 30, ($ in millions; rate in $ per boe) 2021 2020 Increase (Decrease) 2021 2020 Increase (Decrease) Production Expense and Rate Expense Rate United States $ 343 $ 375 (9) % $ 4.49 $ 4.36 3 % International $ 35 $ 43 (19) % $ 2.00 $ 2.00 % Shipping, handling and other operating expenses increased $106 million in the first nine months of 2021 from the comparable 2020 period. As disclosed in our Form 10-K, certain of our processing arrangements with midstream entities are percentage-of-proceeds contracts. We classify the proceeds retained by the midstream companies as shipping and handling cost. The increase in shipping and handling costs of these percentage-of-proceeds contracts coincides with the increase in realized natural gas liquids prices. In addition, higher marketing costs contributed to the increase due to more volumes purchased for resale to satisfy transportation commitments. This was partially offset by higher legal expenses in the first nine months of 2020. Exploration expenses include unproved property impairments, dry well costs, geological and geophysical and other costs. The increase in unproved property impairments were primarily driven by our decision not to drill certain leases related to resource exploration in the third quarter of 2021. The dry well costs include the write-off of suspended costs associated with drilled and uncompleted wells primarily in Permian in the third quarter of 2021. 37 The following table summarizes the components of exploration expenses: Nine Months Ended September 30, (In millions) 2021 2020 Increase (Decrease) Exploration Expenses Unproved property impairments $ 85 $ 62 37 % Dry well costs 16 1 1,500 % Geological and geophysical 3 6 (50) % Other 5 12 (58) % Total exploration expenses $ 109 $ 81 35 % Depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased $245 million in the first nine months of 2021 from the comparable 2020 period, primarily as a result of lower sales volumes in our U.S. and International segments. Our segments apply the units-of-production method to the majority of their assets, including capitalized asset retirement costs; therefore volumes have an impact on DD&A expense. The DD&A rate (expense per boe) is impacted by field-level changes in reserves, capitalized costs and sales volume mix between fields. The following table provides DD&A expense and DD&A expense rates for each segment: Nine Months Ended September 30, ($ in millions; rate in $ per boe) 2021 2020 Increase (Decrease) 2021 2020 Increase (Decrease) DD&A Expense and Rate Expense Rate United States $ 1,477 $ 1,716 (14) % $ 19.33 $ 19.91 (3) % International $ 54 $ 62 (13) % $ 3.10 $ 2.87 8 % Impairments decreased $38 million in the first nine months of 2021. In 2020, we impaired goodwill for $95 million related to our International reporting unit in the first quarter of 2020. Impairments in 2021 consisted of a $30 million impairment related to an increase in the estimated future decommissioning costs of certain non-producing wells, pipelines and production facilities for previously divested offshore assets located in the Gulf of Mexico and a $24 million impairment as we decommissioned certain Eagle Ford central facilities. See Note 10 , Note 11 , and Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the impairments in further detail. Taxes other than income include production, severance and ad valorem taxes, primarily in the U.S., which tend to increase or decrease in relation to revenue and sales volumes. Taxes other than income increased $91 million primarily due to higher price realizations in the U.S. segment in the first nine months of 2021. Net interest and other decreased $66 million in the first nine months of 2021 versus the same period in 2020, primarily as a result of $57 million mark-to-market gains on forward starting interest rate swaps in the first nine months of 2021. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail discussion of the interest rate swaps in the consolidated financial statements. General and administrative expenses increased $10 million in the first nine months of 2021 versus the same period in 2020, primarily as a result of a $13 million expense associated with the termination of an aircraft lease agreement during the first quarter of 2021. Loss on early extinguishment of debt increased $121 million due to make-whole call provisions paid upon redemption of our $500 million 2022 Notes in the second quarter of 2021 and our $900 million 2025 Notes in the third quarter of 2021. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail. Provision (benefit) for income taxes reflects an effective income tax rate of 7% in the first nine months of 2021, as compared to an effective income tax rate of 1% in the same period in 2020. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion concerning the rate changes. 38 Segment Income Segment income represents income that excludes certain items not allocated to our operating segments, net of income taxes. A portion of our corporate and operations general and administrative support costs are not allocated to the operating segments. These unallocated costs primarily consist of employment costs (including pension effects), professional services, facilities and other costs associated with corporate and operations support activities. Additionally, items which affect comparability such as: gains or losses on dispositions, impairments of proved and certain unproved properties, goodwill and equity method investments, unrealized gains or losses on commodity and interest rate derivative instruments, effects of pension settlements and curtailments or other items (as determined by the CODM) are not allocated to operating segments. The following table reconciles segment income (loss) to net income (loss): Nine Months Ended September 30, (In millions) 2021 2020 United States $ 724 $ (520) International 211 1 Segment income (loss) 935 (519) Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes (638) (594) Net income (loss) $ 297 $ (1,113) United States segment income (loss) for the first nine months of 2021 was $724 million of income versus a $520 million loss for the same period in 2020. This increase was primarily due to higher price realizations and lower DD&A expenses. These favorable changes were partially offset by lower sales volumes, realized losses on commodity derivatives (as compared to realized gains in the prior period), higher shipping and handling costs and production taxes in the first nine months of 2021. International segment income (loss) for the first nine months of 2021 was $211 million of income versus $1 million of income for the same period in 2020, primarily due to higher price realizations in E.G. in the first nine months of 2021. Critical Accounting Estimates There have been no material changes or developments in the evaluation of the accounting estimates and the underlying assumptions or methodologies pertaining to our Critical Accounting Estimates disclosed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. 39 Cash Flows Commodity prices are the most significant factor impacting our revenues, profitability, operating cash flows, the amount of capital we invest in our business, principal debt repayments, payment of dividends and funding of share repurchases. As commodity prices increased during the first nine months of 2021, we generated positive cash flow from operations. We continue to expect volatility in commodity prices and that could impact how much cash flow from operations we generate. The following table presents sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents: Nine Months Ended September 30, (In millions) 2021 2020 Sources of cash and cash equivalents Operating activities $ 2,093 $ 1,055 Borrowings 400 Disposal of assets, net of cash transferred to the buyer 29 9 Other 15 7 Total sources of cash and cash equivalents $ 2,137 $ 1,471 Uses of cash and cash equivalents Additions to property, plant and equipment $ (772) $ (1,090) Additions to other assets 15 Debt repayment (1,400) Debt extinguishment costs (117) Purchases of common stock (10) (92) Dividends paid (94) (40) Other (1) (3) Total uses of cash and cash equivalents $ (2,394) $ (1,210) Cash flows generated from operating activities in the first nine months of 2021 were 98% higher compared to the same period in 2020, primarily as a result of higher realized commodity prices. These were partially offset by net realized losses on commodity derivatives (compared to realized gains in the prior period), lower production volumes, and increased working capital usage. The following table shows capital expenditures by segment and reconciles to additions to property, plant and equipment as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows: Nine Months Ended September 30, (In millions) 2021 2020 United States $ 770 $ 874 International 4 Corporate 7 10 Total capital expenditures 781 884 Change in capital expenditure accrual (9) 206 Total use of cash and cash equivalents for property, plant and equipment $ 772 $ 1,090 The decline in our capital expenditures for the U.S. segment in the first nine months of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 was caused by lower drilling and completions activities across all four of our resource plays. Liquidity and Capital Resources Available Liquidity Our main sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, internally generated cash flow from operations, sales of non-core assets, capital market transactions and our revolving Credit Facility. At September 30, 2021, we had approximately $3.6 billion of liquidity consisting of $485 million in cash and cash equivalents and $3.1 billion available under our revolving Credit Facility. 40 Our working capital requirements are supported by our cash and cash equivalents and our Credit Facility. We may draw on our revolving Credit Facility to meet short-term cash requirements or issue debt or equity securities through the shelf registration statement discussed below as part of our longer-term liquidity and capital management program. Because of the alternatives available to us as discussed above, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity are adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements including our capital spending programs, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities, dividends and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies. General economic conditions, commodity prices, and financial, business and other factors, including the global pandemic, could affect our operations and our ability to access the capital markets. We continue to be rated investment grade at all three primary credit rating agencies. A downgrade in our credit ratings could increase our future cost of financing or limit our ability to access capital and could result in additional credit support requirements. We do not have any triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an event of default in the case of a downgrade of our credit ratings. See Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for a discussion of how a downgrade in our credit ratings could affect us. On October 27, 2021, our Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.06 per share payable December 10, 2021 to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 17, 2021. Capital Resources Credit Arrangements and Borrowings In June 2021, we executed the sixth amendment to our unsecured Credit Facility. The primary changes resulting from this amendment are (i) increasing the size of the Credit Facility from $3.0 billion to $3.1 billion, (ii) extending the maturity of the commitments of certain consenting lenders from May 2023 to June 2024 (with the remaining commitment of a single non-consenting lender to mature on May 28, 2023, at which time the size of the Credit Facility will be reduced to $3.0 billion) and (iii) including certain other provisions and revisions, including provisions to provide for the eventual replacement of LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. At September 30, 2021, we had no borrowings against our Credit Facility and $4.0 billion of total long-term debt outstanding. In April 2021, we fully redeemed our outstanding $500 million 2.8% Senior Notes due 2022 and the redemption reduced annual cash interest expense by $14 million. As a result of the redemption, we incurred $19 million in costs related to a make-whole provision premium and the write off of unamortized discount and issuance costs in the second quarter of 2021. In September 2021, we fully redeemed our outstanding $900 million 3.85% 2025 Notes and the redemption reduced annual cash interest expense by approximately $35 million. As a result of the redemption, we incurred $102 million in costs related to a make-whole provision premium and the write off of unamortized discount and issuance costs in the third quarter of 2021. Our next significant long-term debt maturity is in the amount of $1.0 billion due 2027. Refer to our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a listing of our long-term debt maturities. In 2018, we signed an agreement with an owner/lessor to construct and lease a new build-to-suit office building in Houston, Texas. The lease commenced in September 2021, and as of September 30, 2021, we estimate that project costs total approximately $302 million, including land acquisition and construction costs. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Shelf Registration We have a universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer for purposes of SEC rules, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities. Debt-To-Capital Ratio The Credit Facility includes a covenant requiring that our total debt to total capitalization ratio not exceed 65% as of the last day of the fiscal quarter. Our ratio was 20% and 26% at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 41 Capital Requirements Share Repurchase Program No share repurchases were made under our share repurchases program during the nine months ended September 30, 2021. We did repurchase $10 million of shares during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 related to our tax withholding obligation associated with the vesting of employee restricted stock awards. Subsequent to the quarter, we resumed our share repurchase program and repurchased approximately $200 million of shares of our common stock through November 3, 2021. Effective November 3, 2021, our Board of Directors increased our remaining share repurchase program authorization from $1.1 billion to $2.5 billion. Contractual Cash Obligations As of September 30, 2021, material decreases to our contractual cash obligations compared to December 31, 2020 include the redemption of our $500 million 2.8% Senior Notes due 2022 and $900 million 3.85% Senior Notes due 2025. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Additionally, we had a material increase to our contractual cash obligations compared to December 31, 2020 associated with the increased guaranteed residual value of our Houston office building. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Other than the items set forth above, there are no additional material changes to our consolidated cash obligations to make future payments under existing contracts, as disclosed in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Environmental Matters and Other Contingencies We have incurred and will continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately offset by the prices we receive for our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes. These laws generally provide for control of pollutants released into the environment and require responsible parties to undertake remediation of hazardous waste disposal sites. Penalties may be imposed for noncompliance. Other than the items set forth in Part II - Item 1. Legal Proceedings , there have been no significant changes to the environmental, health and safety matters under Item 1. Business or Item 3. Legal Proceedings in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of other contingencies. 42 Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ). All statements, other than statements of historical fact, including without limitation statements regarding our future performance, business strategy, reserve estimates, asset quality, production guidance, drilling plans, capital plans, future debt retirement, cost and expense estimates, asset acquisitions and dispositions, tax allowances, future financial position and other plans and objectives for future cash flow from operations, are forward-looking statements. Words such as anticipate, believe, continue, could, estimate, expect, forecast, future, guidance, intend, may, outlook, plan, positioned, project, seek, should, target, will, would or similar words may be used to identify forward-looking statements; however, the absence of these words does not mean that the statements are not forward-looking. While we believe our assumptions concerning future events are reasonable, a number of factors could cause results to differ materially from those projected, including, but not limited to: conditions in the oil and gas industry, including supply and demand levels for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas and the resulting impact on price; changes in expected reserve or production levels; changes in political and economic conditions in the U.S. and E.G., including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and inflation rates; actions taken by the members of OPEC and Russia affecting the production and pricing of crude oil; and other global and domestic political, economic or diplomatic developments; risks related to our hedging activities; voluntary and involuntary volume curtailments; delays or cancellations of certain drilling activities ; liability or corrective actions resulting from litigation or other proceedings and investigations; capital available for exploration and development; the inability of any party to satisfy closing conditions or delays in execution with respect to our asset acquisitions and dispositions; drilling and operating risks; lack of, or disruption in, access to storage capacity, pipelines or other transportation methods; well production timing; availability of drilling rigs, materials and labor, including the costs associated therewith; difficulty in obtaining necessary approvals and permits; non-performance by third parties of their contractual or legal obligations, including due to bankruptcy; changes in our credit ratings; hazards such as weather conditions, a health pandemic (including COVID-19), acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response thereto; shortages of key personnel, including employees, contractors and subcontractors; security threats, including cybersecurity threats and disruptions to our business and operations from breaches of our information technology systems, or breaches of the information technology systems, facilities and infrastructure of third parties with which we transact business ; changes in safety, health, environmental, tax and other regulations or requirements or initiatives including those addressing the impact of global climate change, air emissions or water management; other geological, operating and economic considerations; and the risk factors, forward-looking statements and challenges and uncertainties described in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC.
