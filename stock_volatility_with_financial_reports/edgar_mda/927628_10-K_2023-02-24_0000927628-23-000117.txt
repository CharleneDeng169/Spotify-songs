Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A ) This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based upon management current expectations and are subject to significant uncertainties and changes in circumstances. Please review Part I Item 1.Business Forward-Looking Statements for more information on the forward-looking statements in this Report. All statements that address operating performance, events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future are forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from those included in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to, those described in Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Report. Unless otherwise specified, references to notes to our consolidated financial statements refer to the notes to our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022 included in this Report. Management monitors a variety of key indicators to evaluate our business results and financial condition. The following MD&A is intended to provide the reader with an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition, including capital and liquidity management, by focusing on changes from year to year in certain key measures used by management to evaluate performance, such as profitability, growth and credit quality metrics. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 and accompanying notes. MD&A is organized in the following sections: Executive Summary Capital Management Consolidated Results of Operations Risk Management Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis Credit Risk Profile Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Liquidity Risk Profile Business Segment Financial Performance Market Risk Profile Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Supplemental Tables Accounting Changes and Developments Glossary and Acronyms 44 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Selected Financial Data The following table presents selected consolidated financial data and performance metrics for the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. We also provide selected key metrics we use in evaluating our performance, including certain metrics that are computed using non-GAAP measures. We consider these metrics to be key financial measures that management uses in assessing our operating performance, capital adequacy and the level of returns generated. We believe these non-GAAP metrics provide useful insight to investors and users of our financial information as they provide an alternate measurement of our performance and assist in assessing our capital adequacy and the level of return generated. These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as a substitute for reported results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP measures that may be presented by other companies.

In comparison, we reported net income of $12.4 billion ($26.94 per diluted common share) on total net revenue of $30.4 billion for 2021 and net income of $2.7 billion ($5.18 per diluted common share) on total net revenue of $28.5 billion for 2020. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio as calculated under the Basel III standardized approach was 12.5% and 13.1% as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. See Capital Management for additional information. In January 2022, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $5.0 billion of shares of our common stock. In Apr il 2022, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $5.0 billion of shares of our common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased $4.8 billion of shares of our common stock. See MD&A Capital Management Dividend Policy and Stock Purchases for additional information. Below are additional highlights of our performance in 2022. These highlights are based on a comparison between the results of 2022 and 2021, except as otherwise noted. The changes in our financial condition and credit performance are generally based on our financial condition and credit performance as of December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021. We provide a more detailed discussion of our financial performance in the sections following this Executive Summary. Discussions of our performance for 2021 compared to 2020 can be found in Part II Item 7. MD&A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. Total Company Performance Earnings: Our net income decreased by $5.0 billion to $7.4 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily driven by: Higher provision for credit losses primarily driven by a net allowance build across all of our segments due to credit normalization, a modestly worse economic outlook and loan growth, compared to a net allowance release across all of our segments in 2021. Higher non-interest expense primarily driven by increased marketing spend, as well as continued investment in technology. These drivers were partially offset by: Higher net interest income and net interest margin primarily driven by higher average loan balances in our credit card loan portfolio relative to the movement of other interest-earning assets. Higher non-interest income primarily driven by higher net interchange fees due to an increase in purchase volume. Loans Held for Investment: Period-end loans held for investment increased by $35.0 billion to $312.3 billion as of December 31, 2022 from December 31, 2021 primarily driven by growth across all of our segments, including $23.0 billion in Credit Card. Average loans held for investment increased by $39.5 billion to $292.2 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily driven by growth across all of our segments, including $17.7 billion in Credit Card. Net Charge-Off and Delinquency Metrics: Our net charge-off rate increased by 48 basis points ( bps ) to 1.36% in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily driven by continued credit normalization in our consumer businesses. Our 30+ day delinquency rate increased by 80 bps to 3.21% as of December 31, 2022 from December 31, 2021 primarily driven by continued credit normalization. 48 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Allowance for Credit Losses: Our allowance for credit losses increased by $1.8 billion to $13.2 billion and our allowance coverage ratio increased by 12 bps to 4.24% as of December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The section below provides a comparative discussion of our consolidated financial performance for 2022 and 2021. We provide a discussion of our business segment results in the following section, Business Segment Financial Performance. This section should be read together with our Executive Summary, where we discuss trends and other factors that we expect will affect our future results of operations. Net Interest Income Net interest income represents the difference between interest income, including certain fees, earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense incurred on our interest-bearing liabilities. Our interest-earning assets include loans, investment securities and other interest-earning assets, while our interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing deposits, securitized debt obligations, senior and subordinated notes, other borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. Generally, we include in interest income any past due fees, net of reversals, on loans that we deem collectible. Our net interest margin, based on our consolidated results, represents the difference between the yield on our interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities, including the notional impact of non-interest-bearing funding. We expect net interest income and our net interest margin to fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 49 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 1 below presents the average outstanding balance, interest income earned, interest expense incurred and average yield for 2022, 2021 and 2020 for each major category of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Nonperforming loans are included in the average loan balances below.

Interest income does not include any allocations, such as funds transfer pricing. Average yield is calculated using whole dollar values for average balances and interest income/expense. (2) Past due fees, net of reversals, included in interest income totaled approximately $1.9 billion in 2022, $1.4 billion in 2021 and $1.3 billion in 2020. (3) Some of our commercial investments generate tax-exempt income, tax credits or other tax benefits. Accordingly, we present our Commercial Banking revenue and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated using the federal statutory tax rate of 21% and state taxes where applicable, with offsetting reductions to the Other category. Taxable-equivalent adjustments included in the interest income and yield computations for our commercial loans totaled approximately $74 million in both 2022 and 2021, and $81 million in 2020, with corresponding reductions to the Other category. 50 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents (4) Interest income/expense in the Other category represents the impact of hedge accounting on our loan portfolios and the offsetting reduction of the taxable-equivalent adjustments of our commercial loans as described above. ** Not meaningful. Net interest income increased by $2.9 billion to $27.1 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily driven by higher average loan balances in our credit card loan portfolio. Net interest margin increased by 46 basis points to 6.67% in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily driven by growth in our credit card loan portfolio relative to the movement in other interest-earning assets, partially offset by higher rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Table 2 displays the change in our net interest income between periods and the extent to which the variance is attributable to: changes in the volume of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities; or changes in the interest rates related to these assets and liabilities.

The portion of interest income or interest expense attributable to both volume and rate is allocated proportionately when the calculation results in a positive value. When the portion of interest income or interest expense attributable to both volume and rate results in a negative value, the total amount is allocated to volume or rate, depending on which amount is positive. (2) Some of our commercial investments generate tax-exempt income, tax credits or other tax benefits. Accordingly, we present our Commercial Banking revenue and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated using the federal statutory tax rate of 21% and state taxes where applicable, with offsetting reductions to the Other category. (3) Interest income/expense in the Other category represents the impact of hedge accounting on our loan portfolios and the offsetting reduction of the taxable-equivalent adjustments of our commercial loans as described above. 51 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Non-Interest Income Table 3 displays the components of non-interest income for 2022, 2021 and 2020. Table 3: Non-Interest Income Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Interchange fees, net $ 4,606 $ 3,860 $ 3,017 Service charges and other customer-related fees 1,625 1,578 1,243 Other non-interest income: (1) Mortgage banking revenue 193 235 249 Treasury and other investment income 51 151 701 Other (2) 661 440 400 Total other non-interest income 905 826 1,350 Total non-interest income $ 7,136 $ 6,264 $ 5,610 ________ (1) Includes a loss of $78 million and gains of $69 million and $45 million on deferred compensation plan investments for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These amounts have corresponding offsets in non-interest expense. (2) Primarily consists of revenue from Capital One Shopping, our credit card partnership agreements and gains or losses on loan sales. In 2022, the gain on sale of card partnership loan portfolios was $192 million. Non-interest income increased by $872 million to $7.1 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily driven by higher net interchange fees due to an increase in purchase volume in our Credit Card business. Provision for Credit Losses Our provision for credit losses in each period is driven by net charge-offs, changes to the allowance for credit losses and changes to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. We recorded a provision for credit losses of $5.8 billion in 2022, $(1.9) billion in 2021 and $10.3 billion in 2020 . Our provision for credit losses increased by $7.8 billion to $5.8 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily driven by a net allowance build across all of our segments due to credit normalization, a modestly worse economic outlook and loan growth, compared to a net allowance release across all of our segments in 2021. We provide additional information on the provision for credit losses and changes in the allowance for credit losses within Credit Risk Profile and Part II Item 8.

These amounts have corresponding offsets from investments in other non-interest income. Non-interest expense increased by $2.6 billion to $19.2 billion in the year ended 2022 compared to 2021, primarily driven by increased marketing spend and increased salaries and associate benefits due to increased employee headcount and continued investment in technology. Income Taxes We recorded an income tax provision of $1.9 billion (20.3% effective income tax rate), $3.4 billion (21.6% effective income tax rate), and $486 million (15.2% effective income tax rate) in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations varies between periods due, in part, to the impact of changes in pre-tax income and changes in tax credits, tax-exempt income and non-deductible expenses relative to our pre-tax earnings. Our effective income tax rate in 2022 decreased by 1.3% compared to 2021. We recorded discrete tax benefits of $71 million in 2022, $66 million in 2021 and $22 million in 2020.

Total liabilities increased by $31.3 billion to $402.7 billion as of December 31, 2022 from December 31, 2021 primarily driven by deposit growth. Stockholders equity decreased by $8.4 billion to $52.6 billion as of December 31, 2022 from December 31, 2021 primarily driven by a decrease in AOCI due to a decline in the fair value of our investment securities portfolio and our common stock repurchases, partially offset by net income of $7.4 billion. The following is a discussion of material changes in the major components of our assets and liabilities during 2022. Period-end balance sheet amounts may vary from average balance sheet amounts due to liquidity and balance sheet management activities that are intended to support the adequacy of capital while managing our liquidity requirements, our customers and our market risk exposure in accordance with our risk appetite. Investment Securities Our investment securities portfolio consists of the following: U.S. government-sponsored enterprise or agency ( Agency ) and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities ( RMBS ), agency commercial mortgage-backed securities ( CMBS ), U.S. Treasury securities and other securities. Agency securities include Government National Mortgage Association ( Ginnie Mae ) guaranteed securities, Federal National Mortgage Association ( Fannie Mae ) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( Freddie Mac ) issued securities. The carrying value of our investments in Agency and U.S. Treasury securities represented 97% and 96% of our total investment securities portfolio as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio decreased by $18.3 billion to $76.9 billion as of December 31, 2022 from December 31, 2021, driven by increases in interest rates and credit spreads, lower reinvestment rates of principal paydowns, and sales. See Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 2 Investment Securities for more information. Loans Held for Investment Total loans held for investment consists of both unsecuritized loans and loans held in our consolidated trusts. Table 5 summarizes, by portfolio segment, the carrying value of our loans held for investment, the allowance for credit losses and net loan balance as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

We provide additional information on the composition of our loan portfolio and credit quality in Credit Risk Profile, Consolidated Results of Operations and Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 3 Loans. Funding Sources Our primary source of funding comes from deposits, as they are a stable and relatively low cost source of funding. In addition to deposits, we raise funding through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, securitized debt obligations, federal funds 54 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents purchased, securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, and FHLB advances secured by certain portions of our loan and securities portfolios. Table 6 provides the composition of our primary sources of funding as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Total deposits increased by $22.0 billion to $333.0 billion as of December 31, 2022 from December 31, 2021 primarily driven by our national banking strategy and issuances of brokered deposits. Securitized debt obligations increased by $2.0 billion to $17.0 billion as of December 31, 2022 from December 31, 2021 primarily driven by net issuances in our auto and credit card securitization programs. Other debt increased by $3.7 billion to $31.7 billion as of December 31, 2022 from December 31, 2021 primarily driven by net issuances of senior debt. We provide additional information on our funding sources in Liquidity Risk Profile and Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 8 Deposits and Borrowings. Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent decreases or increases in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of future reversals of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management judgment that these future deductions are more likely than not to be realized. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of expected taxable income from all sources, including taxable income in carryback years, reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates. We use our historical experience and our short and long-range business forecasts to make these estimates. Deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities and valuation allowances, were approximately $7.7 billion as of December 31, 2022, an increase of $4.0 billion from December 31, 2021. The increase in our net deferred tax assets was primarily driven by the decrease in fair value of our available for sale securities and derivatives, as well as the increase in allowance for credit losses in 2022. We recorded valuation allowances of $446 million and $355 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. If changes in circumstances lead us to change our judgment about our ability to realize deferred tax assets in future years, we will adjust our valuation allowances in the period that our change in judgment occurs and record a corresponding increase or charge to income. We provide additional information on income taxes in Consolidated Results of Operations and Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 15 Income Taxes. 55 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS In the ordinary course of business, we engage in certain activities that are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets, generally referred to as off-balance sheet arrangements. These activities typically involve transactions with unconsolidated variable interest entities ( VIEs ) as well as other arrangements, such as letters of credit, loan commitments and guarantees, to meet the financing needs of our customers and support their ongoing operations. We provide additional information regarding these types of activities in Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 5 Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations and Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 18 Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others. BUSINESS SEGMENT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE Our principal operations are organized for management reporting purposes into three major business segments, which are defined primarily based on the products and services provided or the types of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into or managed as a part of our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio, asset/liability management and oversight of our funds transfer pricing process, are centralized in our Corporate Treasury group. Our residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate that is not assessed to our primary business segments is included in the Other category. The results of our individual businesses, which we report on a continuing operations basis, reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources. We may periodically change our business segments or reclassify business segment results based on modifications to our management reporting methodologies and changes in organizational alignment. Our business segment results are intended to reflect each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. We use an internal management and reporting process to derive our business segment results. Our internal management and reporting process employs various allocation methodologies, including funds transfer pricing, to assign certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses directly or indirectly attributable to each business segment. Total interest income and non-interest income are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported. The net interest income of each segment reflects the results of our funds transfer pricing process, which is primarily based on a matched funding concept that takes into consideration market interest rates. Our funds transfer pricing process is managed by our centralized Corporate Treasury group and provides a funds credit for sources of funds, such as deposits generated by our Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking businesses, and a charge for the use of funds by each segment. The allocation is unique to each business segment and acquired business and is based on the composition of assets and liabilities. The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet products. Periodically, the methodology and assumptions utilized in the funds transfer pricing process are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other factors, which may impact the allocation of net interest income to the business segments. We regularly assess the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, which may result in the implementation of refinements or changes in future periods. We refer to the business segment results derived from our internal management accounting and reporting process as our managed presentation, which differs in some cases from our reported results prepared based on U.S. GAAP. There is no comprehensive authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to U.S. GAAP; therefore, the managed presentation of our business segment results may not be comparable to similar information provided by other financial services companies. In addition, our individual business segment results should not be used as a substitute for comparable results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We summarize our business segment results for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 and provide a comparative discussion of these results for 2022 and 2021, as well as changes in our financial condition and credit performance metrics as of December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021.

Accordingly, we present our Commercial Banking revenue and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated using the federal statutory tax rate of 21% and state taxes where applicable, with offsetting reductions to the Other category. Credit Card Business The primary sources of revenue for our Credit Card business are net interest income, net interchange income and fees collected from customers. Expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating costs and marketing expenses. Our Credit Card business generated net income from continuing operations of $4.9 billion, $7.8 billion and $1.4 billion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 57 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 8 summarizes the financial results of our Credit Card business and displays selected key metrics for the periods indicated.

Key factors affecting the results of our Credit Card business for 2022 compared to 2021, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between December 31, 2022 and 2021 include the following: Net Interest Income: Net interest income increased by $2.5 billion to $16.6 billion in 2022 primarily driven by higher average loan balances. Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income increased by $965 million to $5.8 billion in 2022 primarily driven by higher net interchange fees due to an increase in purchase volume. Provision for Credit Losses: Provision for credit losses increased by $5.2 billion to $4.3 billion in 2022 primarily driven by a net allowance build due to credit normalization, a modestly worse economic outlook and loan growth, compared to a net allowance release in 2021. 58 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense increased by $2.0 billion to $11.6 billion in 2022 primarily driven by increased marketing spend, as well as continued investment in technology.

Net Charge-Off and Delinquency Metrics: The net charge-off rate increased by 63 basis points to 2.53% in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily driven by continued credit normalization. The 30+ day delinquency rate increased by 117 basis points to 3.46% as of December 31, 2022 from December 31, 2021 primarily driven by continued credit normalization. Domestic Card Business The Domestic Card business generated net income from continuing operations of $4.7 billion, $7.3 billion and $1.2 billion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Domestic Card business accounted for greater than 90% of total net revenue of our Credit Card business.

Because our Domestic Card business accounts for the substantial majority of our Credit Card business, the key factors driving the results are similar to the key factors affecting our total Credit Card business. Net income for our Domestic Card business decreased in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily driven by: Higher provision for credit losses primarily driven by a net allowance build due to credit normalization, a modestly worse economic outlook and loan growth, compared to a net allowance release in 2021. Higher non-interest expense primarily driven by increased marketing spend, as well as continued investment in technology. These drivers were partially offset by: Higher net interest income primarily driven by higher average loan balances. Higher non-interest income primarily driven by higher net interchange fees due to an increase in purchase volume. Consumer Banking Business The primary sources of revenue for our Consumer Banking business are net interest income from loans and deposits. Expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating costs and marketing expenses. Our Consumer Banking business generated net income from continuing operations of $2.3 billion, $3.7 billion and $1.4 billion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 60 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 9 summarizes the financial results of our Consumer Banking business and displays selected key metrics for the periods indicated.

Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income decreased by $85 million to $469 million in 2022 primarily driven by changes to our customer overdraft and non-sufficient funds policies in our retail banking business. Provision for Credit Losses: Provision for credit losses increased by $1.7 billion to $1.2 billion in 2022 primarily driven by a net allowance build due to credit normalization, a modestly worse economic outlook and loan growth, compared to a net allowance release in 2021. Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense increased by $601 million to $5.3 billion in 2022 primarily driven by continued investment in technology and increased marketing spend in our retail banking business. Loans Held for Investment: Period-end loans held for investment increased by $2.3 billion to $79.9 billion as of December 31, 2022 from December 31, 2021 and average loans held for investment increased by $6.6 billion to $80.4 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily driven by growth in our auto loan portfolio. Deposits: Period-end deposits increased by $14.2 billion at $270.6 billion as of December 31, 2022 from December 31, 2021 primarily driven by our national banking strategy. Net Charge-Off and Delinquency Metrics: The net charge-off rate increased by 69 basis points to 1.06% in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily driven by continued credit normalization in our auto loan portfolio. The 30+ day delinquency rate increased by 152 basis points to 6.18% as of December 31, 2022 from December 31, 2021 primarily driven by continued credit normalization in our auto loan portfolio. Commercial Banking Business The primary sources of revenue for our Commercial Banking business are net interest income from loans and deposits and non-interest income earned from products and services provided to our clients such as advisory services, capital markets and treasury management. Because our Commercial Banking business has loans and investments that generate tax-exempt income, tax credits or other tax benefits, we present the revenues on a taxable-equivalent basis. Expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses and operating costs. Our Commercial Banking business generated net income from continuing operations of $843 million, $1.5 billion and $65 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 62 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 10 summarizes the financial results of our Commercial Banking business and displays selected key metrics for the periods indicated.

Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income remained substantially flat at $1.1 billion in 2022. Provision for Credit Losses: Provision for credit losses increased by $934 million to $415 million in 2022 primarily driven by a net allowance build due to a modestly worse economic outlook and loan growth, compared to a net allowance release in 2021. Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense increased by $255 million to $2.1 billion in 2022 primarily driven by continued investment in growth and technology. Loans Held for Investment: Period-end loans held for investment increased by $9.8 billion to $94.7 billion as of December 31, 2022 from December 31, 2021 and average loans held for investment increased by $15.3 billion to $91.4 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily driven by growth across our loan portfolio. Deposits: Period-end deposits decreased by $4.0 billion to $40.8 billion as of December 31, 2022 from December 31, 2021 primarily driven by the transfer of deposits to our retail banking portfolio in the second quarter of 2022. Net Charge-Off and Nonperforming Metrics: The net charge-off rate increased by 8 basis points to 0.08% in 2022 primarily driven by isolated charge offs in our commercial and industrial loan portfolio. The nonperforming loan rate decreased by 8 basis points to 0.74% as of December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021 primarily driven by higher ending loan balances. Other Category Other includes unallocated amounts related to our centralized Corporate Treasury group activities, such as management of our corporate investment securities portfolio, asset/liability management and oversight of our funds transfer pricing process. Other also includes: unallocated corporate revenue and expenses that do not directly support the operations of the business segments or for which the business segments are not considered financially accountable in evaluating their performance, such as certain restructuring charges; offsets related to certain line-item reclassifications; residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate that is not assessed to our primary business segments; and foreign exchange-rate fluctuations on foreign currency-denominated balances. 64 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 11 summarizes the financial results of our Other category for the periods indicated.

Loss from continuing operations increased by $88 million to a loss of $660 million in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily driven by higher net interest losses due to higher funding costs driven by higher market interest rates, partially offset by insurance recoveries on previously incurred expenses in non-interest expense. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make a number of judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses on the consolidated financial statements. Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We provide a summary of our significant accounting policies under Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. We have identified the following accounting estimates as critical because they require significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Our critical accounting policies and estimates are as follows: Loan loss reserves Goodwill Fair value Customer rewards reserve We evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and update them as necessary, based on changing conditions. 65 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Loan Loss Reserves We maintain an allowance for credit losses that represents management current estimate of expected credit losses inherent in our credit card, consumer banking and commercial banking loans held for investment portfolios as of each balance sheet date. We also reserve for the uncollectible portion of finance charges and fees related to credit card loan receivables in the allowance for credit losses consistent with the methodology we use to estimate the allowance for credit losses on the principal portion of our credit card loan receivables. We also separately reserve for unfunded lending commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable. We build our allowance for credit losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments through the provision for credit losses, which is driven by charge-offs, changes in the allowance for credit losses and changes in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The allowance for credit losses was $13.2 billion as of December 31, 2022, compared to $11.4 billion as of December 31, 2021. Our allowance for credit losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments utilize models to derive a quantitative estimate of credit losses that is supplemented with additional qualitative considerations to capture risks and uncertainties not included in the quantitative result. Our estimate of expected credit losses, for all loan and unfunded lending commitments, includes a reasonable and supportable forecast period of one year and then reverts over a one-year period to historical losses at each relevant loss component of the estimate. We use externally produced consensus estimates as inputs for our forward-looking macroeconomic forecast and consider other forecasts and sources of uncertainty to develop the quantitative component. This quantitative result is then supplemented qualitatively by management for economic uncertainty, including the consideration of alternative macroeconomic scenarios, changes and trends in loan portfolios that may not be captured in the quantitative component. These adjustments represent management judgment of the imprecision and risks inherent in the processes and assumptions used in establishing the allowance for credit losses. We have an established process, using analytical tools and management judgment, to determine our allowance for credit losses. Significant management judgment is required to determine the relevant information and estimation methods used to arrive at our best estimate of lifetime credit losses. Establishing the allowance on a quarterly basis involves evaluating and forecasting both credit and macroeconomic variables. The macroeconomic forecast used to inform both quantitative and qualitative components of our allowance for credit losses estimate is sensitive to variables that may impact borrowers ability to pay, such as the U.S. Unemployment Rate, and the U.S. Real Gross Domestic Product ( U.S. Real GDP ) Rate assumptions. Our December 31, 2022 allowance assumes that the average unemployment rate gradually increases to approximately 5.0% by the fourth quarter of 2023 and annualized U.S. Real GDP decreases 0.3% in 2023. In addition to macroeconomic factors, many credit factors inform our allowance for credit losses, including, but not limited to, historical loss and recovery experience, recent trends in delinquencies and charge-offs, risk ratings, the impact of bankruptcy filings, the value of collateral underlying secured loans, account seasoning, changes in our credit evaluation, underwriting and collection management policies, seasonality, credit bureau scores, current general economic conditions, changes in the legal and regulatory environment and uncertainties in forecasting and modeling techniques used in estimating our allowance for credit losses. We have a governance framework supported by processes and controls intended to ensure that our estimate of the allowance for credit losses is appropriate. Our governance framework provides for oversight of methods, models, qualitative adjustments, process controls and results. At least quarterly, representatives from the Finance and Risk Management organizations review and assess our allowance methodologies, key assumptions and the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses. Groups independent of our estimation functions participate in the review and validation process. Tasks performed by these groups include periodic review of the rationale for and quantification of inputs requiring judgment as well as adjustments to results. We have a model policy, established by an independent Model Risk Office, which governs the validation of models and related supporting documentation to ensure the appropriate use of models for estimating credit losses. The Model Risk Office validates all models and requires ongoing monitoring of their performance. In addition to the allowance for credit losses, on a quarterly basis, we review and assess our estimate of expected losses related to unfunded lending commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable which are generally in our Commercial Banking business. The factors impacting our assessment generally align with those considered in our evaluation of the allowance for credit losses for the Commercial Banking business. The reserve for losses on unfunded lending commitments is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and changes to it are recorded through the provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of income. 66 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Although we examine a variety of externally available data, as well as our internal loan performance data, to determine our allowance for credit losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments, our estimation process is subject to risks and uncertainties, including a reliance on historical loss and trend information that may not be representative of current conditions and indicative of future performance as well as economic forecasts that may not align with actual future economic conditions. Accordingly, our actual credit loss experience may not be in line with our expectations. We provide additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used in determining our allowance for credit losses for each of our loan portfolio segments in Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. We provide information on the components of our allowance, disaggregated by operating segment, and changes in our allowance in Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 4 Allowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Goodwill totaled $14.8 billion as of both December 31, 2022 and 2021. We did not recognize any goodwill impairment in 2022 or 2021. See Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 6 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for additional information. We perform our goodwill impairment test annually on October 1 at a reporting unit level. We are also required to test goodwill for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate it is more-likely-than-not that an impairment may have occurred. An impairment of a reporting unit goodwill is determined based on the amount by which the reporting unit carrying value exceeds its fair value, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. We have four reporting units: Credit Card, Auto Finance, Other Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. For the purpose of our goodwill impairment testing, we calculate the carrying amount of a reporting unit using an allocated capital approach based on each reporting unit specific regulatory capital requirements, economic capital requirements and underlying risks. The carrying amount for a reporting unit is the sum of its respective capital requirements, goodwill and other intangibles balances. Known future capital needs, such as dividends, share buybacks or other strategic initiatives, are assumed distributed to equity holders in future periods and are not allocated to the reporting units or the Other category. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is a subjective process that requires the use of estimates and the exercise of significant judgment. We calculate the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow ( DCF ) calculation, a form of the income approach. This DCF calculation uses projected cash flows based on each reporting unit internal forecast and the perpetuity growth method to calculate terminal values. Our DCF calculation requires management to make estimates about future loan, deposit and revenue growth, as well as credit losses and capital rates. These cash flows and terminal values are then discounted using discount rates based on our external cost of capital with adjustments for the risk inherent in each reporting unit . Discount rates used for our reporting units ranged from 8.4% to 12.2%, and we applied a terminal year long-term growth rate of 3.7% to all reporting units. The reasonableness of our DCF calculation is a ssessed by reference to a market-based approach using comparable market multiples and recent market transactions where available. The results of the 2022 annual impairment test for the reporting units indicated that the estimated fair values of the Commercial Banking, Credit Card, Auto Finance, and Other Consumer Banking reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts by between 17% and 72%. Assumptions used in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit are judgmental and inherently uncertain. A change in the economic conditions of a reporting unit, such as declines in business performance as a result of industry or macroeconomic trends or changes in our strategy, adverse impacts to loan or deposit growth trends, decreases in revenue, increases in expenses, increases in credit losses, increases in capital requirements, deterioration of market conditions, declines in long-term growth expectations, adverse impacts of regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated cost of capital, including if these conditions are merely forecasted to occur in future periods, could cause the estimated fair values of our reporting units to decline in the future, and increase the risk of a goodwill impairment in a future period. We have a governance framework supported by processes and controls intended to ensure that the accounting and disclosure for goodwill is appropriate. Our governance framework provides for oversight of assumptions, forecast inputs, methods, process controls and results. 67 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Fair Value Fair value, also referred to as an exit price, is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The fair value accounting guidance provides a three-level fair value hierarchy for classifying financial instruments. This hierarchy is based on the markets in which the assets or liabilities trade and whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable. The fair value measurement of a financial asset or liability is assigned a level based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: Level 1: Valuation is based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Valuation is based on observable market-based inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3: Valuation is generated from techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. Valuation techniques include pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques. The degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted prices in active markets or observable market parameters. When quoted prices and observable data in active markets are not fully available, management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. Changes in market conditions, such as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities, may reduce the availability and reliability of quoted prices or observable data used to determine fair value. We have developed policies and procedures to determine when markets for our financial assets and liabilities are inactive if the level and volume of activity has declined significantly relative to normal conditions. If markets are determined to be inactive, it may be appropriate to adjust price quotes received. When significant adjustments are required to price quotes or inputs, it may be appropriate to utilize an estimate based primarily on unobservable inputs. Significant judgment may be required to determine whether certain financial instruments measured at fair value are classified as Level 2 or Level 3. In making this determination, we consider all available information that market participants use to measure the fair value of the financial instrument, including observable market data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs used. Based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category, judgments are made regarding the significance of the Level 3 inputs to the instruments fair value measurement in its entirety. If Level 3 inputs are considered significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3. The process for determining fair value using unobservable inputs is generally more subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and assumptions. We discuss changes in the valuation inputs and assumptions used in determining the fair value of our financial instruments, including the extent to which we have relied on significant unobservable inputs to estimate fair value and our process for corroborating these inputs, in Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 16 Fair Value Measurement. We have a governance framework and a number of key controls that are intended to ensure that our fair value measurements are appropriate and reliable. Our governance framework provides for independent oversight and segregation of duties. Our control processes include review and approval of new transaction types, price verification, and review of valuation judgments, methods, models, process controls and results. Groups independent of our trading and investing functions participate in the review and validation process. Tasks performed by these groups include periodic verification of fair value measurements to determine if assigned fair values are reasonable, including comparing prices from vendor pricing services to other available market information. Our Fair Value Committee ( FVC ), which includes representation from business areas, Risk Management and Finance, provides guidance and oversight to ensure an appropriate valuation control environment. The FVC regularly reviews and approves our fair valuations to ensure that our valuation practices are consistent with industry standards and adhere to regulatory and accounting guidance. 68 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents We have a model policy, established by an independent Model Risk Office, which governs the validation of models and related supporting documentation to ensure the appropriate use of models for pricing and fair value measurements. The Model Risk Office validates all models and requires ongoing monitoring of their performance. The fair value governance process is set up in a manner that allows the Chairperson of the FVC to escalate valuation disputes that cannot be resolved by the FVC to a more senior committee called the Valuations Advisory Committee ( VAC ) for resolution. The VAC is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and includes other members of senior manageme nt. . There were no disputes escalated to the VAC for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Customer Rewards Reserve We offer products, primarily credit cards, which include programs that allow members to earn rewards based on account activity that can be redeemed for cash (primarily in the form of statement credits), gift cards, travel, or covering eligible charges. The amount of rewards that a customer earns varies based on the terms and conditions of the rewards program and product. The majority of our rewards do not expire and there is no limit on the amount of rewards an eligible card member can earn. Customer rewards costs, which we generally record as an offset to interchange income, are driven by various factors such as card member purchase volume, the terms and conditions of the rewards program and rewards redemption cost. We establish a customer rewards reserve that reflects management judgment regarding rewards earned that are expected to be redeemed and the estimated redemption cost. We use financial models to estimate ultimate redemption rates of rewards earned to date by current card members based on historical redemption trends, current enrollee redemption behavior, card product type, year of program enrollment, enrollment tenure and card spend levels. Our current assumption is that the vast majority of all rewards earned will eventually be redeemed. We use the weighted-average redemption cost during the previous twelve months, adjusted as appropriate for recent changes in redemption costs, including changes related to the mix of rewards redeemed, to estimate future redemption costs. We continually evaluate our reserve and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns, changes to the terms and conditions of the rewards program and other factors. While the rewards liability is sensitive to changes in assumptions for redemption rates and costs and involves management judgment, we believe portfolio characteristics and historical performance are the best indication of future reward redemption behavior and are the primary basis for our estimate. We recognized customer rewards expense of $7.6 billion, $6.4 billion and $4.9 billion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our customer rewards reserve, which is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, totaled $6.8 billion and $6.2 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We have a governance framework supported by processes and controls that are intended to ensure that our rewards liability estimate is appropriate and reliable. Our governance framework provides for oversight of assumptions, inputs, methods, process controls and results. Additional controls are performed to ensure all underlying data used to derive the rewards liability is complete and accurate. ACCOUNTING CHANGES AND DEVELOPMENTS Accounting Standards Issued but Not Adopted as of December 31, 2022 Standard Guidance Adoption Timing and Financial Statement Impacts TDR and Vintage Disclosures ASU No. 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructuring and Vintage Disclosures Issued March 2022 The amendments in this update eliminate the accounting guidance for Troubled Debt Restructurings, while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The amendments also require public entities to disclose current-period gross charge offs by year of origination for loans held for investment. This ASU became effective for us on January 1, 2023. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2023 using the modified retrospective method. Adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 69 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The level and composition of our capital are determined by multiple factors, including our consolidated regulatory capital requirements as described in more detail below and internal risk-based capital assessments such as internal stress testing. The level and composition of our capital may also be influenced by rating agency guidelines, subsidiary capital requirements, business environment, conditions in the financial markets and assessments of potential future losses due to adverse changes in our business and market environments. Capital Standards and Prompt Corrective Action The Company and the Bank are subject to the Basel III Capital Rules. The Basel III Capital Rules implement certain capital requirements published by the Basel Committee, along with certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and other capital provisions. As a BHC with total consolidated assets of at least $250 billion but less than $700 billion and not exceeding any of the applicable risk-based thresholds, the Company is a Category III institution under the Basel III Capital Rules. The Bank, as a subsidiary of a Category III institution, is a Category III bank. Moreover, the Bank, as an insured depository institution, is subject to PCA capital regulations. Basel III and United States Capital Rules Under the Basel III Capital Rules, we must maintain a minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% and a total capital ratio of 8.0%, in each case in relation to risk-weighted assets. In addition, we must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0% and a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3.0%. We are also subject to the capital conservation buffer requirement and countercyclical capital buffer requirement as described below. Our capital and leverage ratios are calculated based on the Basel III standardized approach framework. We have elected to exclude certain elements of AOCI from our regulatory capital as permitted for a Category III institution. G-SIBs that are based in the U.S. are subject to an additional CET1 capital requirement known as the G-SIB Surcharge. We are not a G-SIB based on the most recent available data and thus we are not subject to a G-SIB Surcharge. Stress Capital Buffer Rule The Basel III Capital Rules require banking institutions to maintain a capital conservation buffer, composed of CET1 capital, above the regulatory minimum ratios. Under the Stress Capital Buffer Rule, the Company standardized approach capital conservation buffer includes its stress capital buffer requirement (as described below), any G-SIB Surcharge (which is not applicable to us) and the countercyclical capital buffer requirement (which is currently set at 0%). Any determination to increase the countercyclical capital buffer generally would be effective twelve months after the announcement of such an increase, unless the Federal Banking Agencies set an earlier effective date. The Company stress capital buffer requirement is recalibrated every year based on the Company supervisory stress test results. In particular, the Company stress capital buffer requirement equals, subject to a floor of 2.5%, the sum of (i) the difference between the Company starting CET1 capital ratio and its lowest projected CET1 capital ratio under the severely adverse scenario of the Federal Reserve supervisory stress test plus (ii) the ratio of the Company projected four quarters of common stock dividends (for the fourth to seventh quarters of the planning horizon) to the projected risk-weighted assets for the quarter in which the Company projected CET1 capital ratio reaches its minimum under the supervisory stress test. Based on the Company 2021 supervisory stress test results, the Company stress capital buffer requirement for the period beginning on October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022 was 2.5%. Therefore, the Company minimum capital requirements plus the standardized approach capital conservation buffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios under the stress capital buffer framework were 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5%, respectively, for the period from October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022. Based on the Company 2022 supervisory stress test results, the Company stress capital buffer requirement for the period beginning on October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023 is 3.1%. Therefore, the Company minimum capital requirements plus the standardized approach capital conservation buffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios under the 70 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents stress capital buffer framework are 7.6%, 9.1% and 11.1%, respectively, for the period from October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023 . The Stress Capital Buffer Rule does not apply to the Bank. The capital conservation buffer for the Bank continues to be fixed at 2.5%. Accordingly, the Bank minimum capital requirements plus its capital conservation buffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios are 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5% respectively. If the Company or the Bank fails to maintain its capital ratios above the minimum capital requirements plus the applicable capital conservation buffer requirements, it will face increasingly strict automatic limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to certain executive officers. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, the Company and the Bank each exceeded the minimum capital requirements and the capital conservation buffer requirements applicable to them, and the Company and the Bank were each well-capitalized. The well-capitalized standards applicable to the Company are established in the Federal Reserve regulations, and the well-capitalized standards applicable to the Bank are established in the OCC PCA capital requirements. Market Risk Rule The Market Risk Rule supplements the Basel III Capital Rules by requiring institutions subject to the rule to adjust their risk-based capital ratios to reflect the market risk in their trading book. The Market Risk Rule generally applies to institutions with aggregate trading assets and liabilities equal to 10% or more of total assets or $1 billion or more. As of December 31, 2022, the Company and CONA are subject to the Market Risk Rule. See Market Risk Profile below for additional information. CECL Transition Rule The Federal Banking Agencies adopted the CECL Transition Rule that provides banking institutions an optional five-year transition period to phase in the impact of the CECL standard on their regulatory capital, the CECL Transition Election. We adopted the CECL standard (for accounting purposes) as of January 1, 2020, and made the CECL Transition Election (for regulatory capital purposes) in the first quarter of 2020. Therefore, the applicable amounts presented in this Report reflect such election. Pursuant to the CECL Transition Rule, a banking institution could elect to delay the estimated impact of adopting CECL on its regulatory capital through December 31, 2021 and then phase in the estimated cumulative impact from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. For the day 2 ongoing impact of CECL during the initial two years, the Federal Banking Agencies used a uniform scaling factor of 25% as an approximation of the increase in the allowance under the CECL standard compared to the prior incurred loss methodology. Accordingly, from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021, electing banking institutions were permitted to add back to their regulatory capital an amount equal to the sum of the after-tax day 1 CECL adoption impact and 25% of the increase in the allowance since the adoption of the CECL standard. From January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024, the after-tax day 1 CECL adoption impact and the cumulative day 2 ongoing impact are being phased in to regulatory capital at 25% per year. The following table summarizes the capital impact delay and phase in period on our regulatory capital from years 2020 to 2025. Capital Impact Delayed Phase In Period 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 Day 1 CECL adoption impact Capital impact delayed to 2022 25% Phased In 50% Phased In 75% Phased In Fully Phased In Cumulative day 2 ongoing impact 25% scaling factor as an approximation of the increase in allowance under CECL As of December 31, 2021, we added back an aggregate amount of $2.4 billion to our regulatory capital pursuant to the CECL Transition Rule. Consistent with the rule, we phased in 25% of this amount, or $599 million, on January 1, 2022, leaving $1.8 billion to be phased in over 2023-2025. As of December 31, 2022, the Company CET1 capital ratio, reflecting the CECL Transition Rule, was 12.5% and would have been 12.0% excluding the impact of the CECL Transition Rule (or on a fully phased-in basis ).

As a BHC, our ability to pay dividends is largely dependent upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries. The Bank is subject to regulatory restrictions that limit its ability to transfer funds to our BHC. As of December 31, 2022, funds available for dividend payments from the Bank were $3.2 billion. There can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends to stockholders. In January 2022, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $5.0 billion of shares of our common stock. In Apr il 2022, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $5.0 billion of shares of our common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased $4.8 billion of shares of our common stock. The timing and exact amount of any future common stock repurchases will depend on various factors, including regulatory approval, market conditions, opportunities for growth, our capital position and the amount of retained earnings. The Board authorized stock repurchase program does not include specific price targets, may be executed through open market purchases, tender offers, or privately negotiated transactions, including utilizing Rule 10b5-1 programs, and may be suspended at any time.

It also sets expectations for our Three Lines of Defense model, which defines the roles, responsibilities and accountabilities for taking and managing risk across the Company. Accountability for overseeing an effective Framework resides with our Board of Directors either directly or through its committees. The Framework also sets expectations for our Three Lines of Defense model, which defines the roles, responsibilities and accountabilities for taking and managing risk across the Company. First Line Identifies and Owns Risk Second Line Advises & Challenges First Line Third Line Provides Independent Assurance Definition Business areas that are accountable for risk and responsible for: i) generating revenue or reducing expenses; ii) supporting the business to provide products or services to customers; or iii) providing technology services for the first line. Independent Risk Management ( IRM ) and Support Functions (e.g., Human Resources, Accounting, Legal) that provide support services to the Company. Internal Audit and Credit Review Key Responsibilities Identify, assess, measure, monitor, control, and report the risks associated with their business. Independent Risk Management (IRM): Independently oversees and assesses risk taking activities for the first line of defense. Support Functions: Centers of specialized expertise that provide support services to the enterprise. Provides independent and objective assurance to the Board of Directors and senior management that that systems and governance processes are designed and working as intended. 75 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Our Framework sets consistent expectations for risk management across the Company and consists of the following nine elements: Governance and Accountability Strategy and Risk Alignment Risk Identification Assessment, Measurement and Response Monitoring and Testing Aggregation, Reporting and Escalation Capital and Liquidity Management (including Stress Testing) Risk Data and Enabling Technology Culture and Talent Management Governance and Accountability This element of the Framework sets the foundation for the methods for governing risk taking and the interactions within and among our three lines of defense. We established a risk governance structure and accountabilities to effectively and consistently oversee the management of risks across the Company. Our Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and management establish the tone at the top regarding the culture of the Company, including management of risk. Management reinforces expectations at the various levels of the organization. Strategy and Risk Alignment Our strategy is informed by and aligned with risk appetite, from development to execution. The Chief Executive Officer develops the strategy with input from the first, second, and third lines of defense, as well as the Board of Directors. The strategic planning process considers relevant changes to the Company overall risk profile. Our Board of Directors approves a Risk Appetite Statement for the Company to set forth the high-level principles that govern risk taking at the Company. The Risk Appetite Statement defines the Board of Directors tolerance for certain risk outcomes at an enterprise level and enables senior management to manage and report within these boundaries. This Risk Appetite Statement is also supported by risk category specific risk appetite statements as well as metrics and, where appropriate, Board Limits and Board Notification Thresholds. Risk Identification The first line of defense and certain Support Functions identify new and emerging risks, including concentration of risk, across the relevant risk categories associated with their business activities and objectives, in consultation with IRM. Risk identification also must be informed by major changes in infrastructure or organization, introduction of new products and services, acquisitions of businesses, or substantial changes in the internal or external environment. IRM and certain Support Functions, where appropriate, provide effective challenge in the risk identification process. IRM is also responsible for identifying our material aggregate risks on an ongoing basis. 76 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Assessment, Measurement and Response Management assesses risks associated with our activities. Risks identified are assessed to understand the severity of each risk and likelihood of occurrence under both normal and stressful conditions. Risk severity is measured through modeling and other quantitative estimation approaches, as well as qualitative approaches, based on management judgment. As part of the risk assessment process, the first and second lines of defense also evaluate the effectiveness of the existing control environment and mitigation strategies. Management determines the appropriate risk response. Risks may be mitigated or accepted. Actions taken to respond to the risk include implementing new controls, enhancing existing controls, developing additional mitigation strategies to reduce the impact of the risk, and/or monitoring the risk. Monitoring and Testing Management periodically monitors risks to evaluate and measure how the risk is affecting our strategy and business objectives, in alignment with risk appetite, including established concentration risk limits. The scope and frequency of monitoring activities depends on the results of relevant risk assessments, as well as specific business risk operations and activities. The first line of defense is required to evaluate the effectiveness of risk management practices and controls through testing and other activities. IRM and Support Functions, as appropriate, assess the first line of defense evaluation of risk management, which may include conducting effective challenge, performing independent monitoring, or conducting risk or control validations. The third line of defense provides independent assurance for first and second line risk management practices and controls. Aggregation, Reporting and Escalation Risk aggregation supports strategic decision making and risk management practices through collectively reporting risks across different levels of the Company and providing a comprehensive view of performance against risk appetite. Capital One risk aggregation processes are designed to aggregate risk information from lower levels of the business hierarchy to high levels and to aggregate risk information to determine material risk themes. Material risks, new or emerging risks, aggregate risks, risk appetite metrics and other measures across all risk categories are reported to the appropriate governance forum no less than quarterly. Material risks are reported to the Board of Directors and senior management committees no less than quarterly. Capital and Liquidity Management (including Stress Testing) Our capital management processes are linked to its risk management practices, including the enterprise-wide identification, assessment and measurement of risks to ensure that all relevant risks are incorporated in the assessment of the Company's capital adequacy. We use identified risks to inform key aspects of the Company capital planning, including the development of stress scenarios, the assessment of the adequacy of post-stress capital levels, and the appropriateness of potential capital actions considering the Company capital objectives. We quantify capital needs through stress testing, regulatory capital, economic capital and assessments of market considerations. In assessing its capital adequacy, we identify how and where our material risks are accounted for within the capital planning process. Monitoring and escalation processes exist for key capital thresholds and metrics to continuously monitor capital adequacy. We manage liquidity risk by applying our Liquidity Adequacy Framework (the Liquidity Framework ). The Liquidity Framework uses internal and regulatory stress testing and the evaluation of other balance sheet metrics to confirm that we maintain a fortified balance sheet that is resilient to uncertainties that may arise as a consequence of systemic, idiosyncratic, or combined liquidity events. Risk Data and Enabling Technology Risk data and technology provides the basis for risk reporting and is used in decision making and to monitor and review changes to our risk profile. There is a core Governance, Risk Management and Compliance system which is used as the system of record for risks, controls, issues and events for our risk categories and supports the analysis, aggregation and reporting capabilities across the categories. 77 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Culture and Talent Management The Framework must be supported with the right culture, talent and skills to enable effective risk management across the Company. Every associate at the Company is responsible for risk management; however, associates with specific risk management skills and expertise within the first, second and third lines of defense are critical to execute appropriate risk management across the enterprise. Risk Categories We apply our Framework to protect the Company from the major categories of risk that we are exposed to through our business activities. Our seven major categories of risk are: Major Categories of Risk Compliance The risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from violations of laws, rules or regulations. Compliance risk can also arise from nonconformance with prescribed practices, internal policies and procedures, contractual obligations or ethical standards that reinforce those laws, rules or regulations Credit The risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from an obligor failure to meet the terms of any contract with the Company or otherwise perform as agreed Liquidity The risk that the Company will not be able to meet its future financial obligations as they come due, or invest in future asset growth because of an inability to obtain funds at a reasonable price within a reasonable time Market The risk that an institution earnings or the economic value of equity could be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates or other market factors Operational The risk of loss, capital impairment, adverse customer experience or reputational impact resulting from failure to comply with policies and procedures, failed internal processes or systems, or from external events Reputation The risk to market value, recruitment and retention of talented associates and maintenance of a loyal customer base due to the negative perceptions of our internal and external constituents regarding our business strategies and activities Strategic The risk of a material impact on current or anticipated earnings, capital, franchise or enterprise value arising from the Company competitive and market position and evolving forces in the industry that can affect that position; lack of responsiveness to these conditions; strategic decisions to change the Company scale, market position or operating model; or, failure to appropriately consider implementation risks inherent in the Company strategy We provide an overview of how we manage our seven major categories of risk below. Compliance Risk Management We recognize that compliance requirements for financial institutions are increasingly complex and that there are heightened expectations from our regulators and our customers. In response, we continuously evaluate the regulatory environment and proactively adjust our compliance program to fully address these expectations. Our Compliance Management Program establishes expectations for determining compliance requirements, assessing the risk of new product offerings, creating appropriate controls and training to address requirements, monitoring for control performance, and independently testing for adherence to compliance requirements. The program also establishes regular compliance reporting to senior business leaders, the executive committee and the Board of Directors. 78 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents The Chief Compliance Officer is responsible for establishing and overseeing our Compliance Management Program. Business areas incorporate compliance requirements and controls into their business policies, standards, processes and procedures. They regularly monitor and report on the efficacy of their compliance controls and our Compliance team periodically independently tests to validate the effectiveness of business controls. Credit Risk Management We recognize that we are exposed to cyclical changes in credit quality. Consequently, we try to ensure our credit portfolio is resilient to economic downturns. Our most important tool in this endeavor is sound underwriting. In unsecured consumer loan underwriting, we generally assume that loans will be subject to an environment in which losses are higher than those prevailing at the time of underwriting. In commercial underwriting, we generally require strong cash flow, collateral, covenants, and guarantees. In addition to sound underwriting, we continually monitor our portfolio and take steps to collect or work out distressed loans. The Chief Risk Officer, in conjunction with the Consumer and Commercial Chief Credit Officers, is responsible for establishing credit risk policies and procedures, including underwriting and hold guidelines and credit approval authority, and monitoring credit exposure and performance of our lending related transactions. Our Consumer and Commercial Chief Credit Officers are responsible for evaluating the risk implications of credit strategy and the oversight of credit for both the existing portfolio and any new credit investments. They also have formal approval authority for various types and levels of credit decisions, including individual commercial loan transactions. Division Presidents within each segment are responsible for managing the credit risk within their divisions and maintaining processes to control credit risk and comply with credit policies and guidelines. In addition, the Chief Risk Officer establishes policies, delegates approval authority and monitors performance for non-loan credit exposure entered into with financial counterparties or through the purchase of credit sensitive securities in our investment portfolio. Our credit policies establish standards in five areas: customer selection, underwriting, monitoring, remediation and portfolio management. The standards in each area provide a framework comprising specific objectives and control processes. These standards are supported by detailed policies and procedures for each component of the credit process. Starting with customer selection, our goal is to generally provide credit on terms that generate above hurdle returns. We use a number of quantitative and qualitative factors to manage credit risk, including setting credit risk limits and guidelines for each of our lines of business. We monitor performance relative to these guidelines and report results and any required mitigating actions to appropriate senior management committees and our Board of Directors. Liquidity Risk Management We manage liquidity risk by applying our Liquidity Adequacy Framework (the Liquidity Framework ). The Liquidity Framework uses internal and regulatory stress testing and the evaluation of other balance sheet metrics to confirm that we maintain a fortified balance sheet that is resilient to uncertainties that may arise as a consequence of systemic, idiosyncratic, or combined liquidity events. We continuously monitor market and economic conditions to evaluate emerging stress conditions and to develop appropriate action plans in accordance with our Contingency Funding Plan and our Recovery Plan, which include the Company policies, procedures and action plans for managing liquidity stress events. The Liquidity Framework enables us to manage our liquidity risk in accordance with regulatory requirements. Additionally, the Liquidity Framework establishes governing principles that apply to the management of liquidity risk. We use these principles to monitor, measure and report liquidity risk; to develop funding and investment strategies that enable us to maintain an adequate level of liquidity to support our businesses and satisfy regulatory requirements; and to protect us from a broad range of liquidity events should they arise. The Chief Risk Officer, in conjunction with the Chief Market and Liquidity Risk Officer, is responsible for the establishment of liquidity risk management policies and standards for governance and monitoring of liquidity risk at a corporate level. We assess liquidity strength by evaluating several different balance sheet metrics under severe stress scenarios to ensure we can withstand significant funding degradation through idiosyncratic, systemic and combined liquidity stress scenarios. Management reports liquidity metrics to appropriate senior management committees and to our Board of Directors no less than quarterly. We seek to mitigate liquidity risk strategically and tactically. From a strategic perspective, we have acquired and built deposit gathering businesses and actively monitor our funding concentration. From a tactical perspective, we have accumulated a sizable liquidity reserve comprised of cash and cash equivalents, high-quality, unencumbered securities and committed 79 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents collateralized credit lines. We also continue to maintain access to secured and unsecured debt markets through regular issuance. This combination of stable and diversified funding sources and our stockpile of liquidity reserves enable us to maintain confidence in our liquidity position. Market Risk Management The Chief Financial Officer and the Chief Risk Officer are responsible for the establishment of market risk management policies and standards for the governance and monitoring of market risk at a corporate level. Market risk is inherent from the financial instruments associated with our business operations and activities including loans, deposits, securities, short-term borrowings, long-term debt and derivatives. We manage market risk exposure, which is principally driven by balance sheet interest rate risk, centrally and establish quantitative risk limits to monitor and control our exposure. We recognize that interest rate and foreign exchange risk is present in our business due to the nature of our assets and liabilities. In addition to using industry accepted techniques to analyze and measure interest rate and foreign exchange risk, we perform sensitivity analysis to identify our risk exposures under a broad range of scenarios. Investment securities and derivatives are the main levers for the management of interest rate risk. In addition, we also use derivatives to manage our foreign exchange risk. The market risk positions for the Company and the Bank are calculated separately and in aggregate, and analyzed against pre-established limits. Results are reported to the Asset Liability Committee monthly and to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors no less than quarterly. Management is authorized to utilize financial instruments as outlined in our policy to actively manage market risk exposure. Operational Risk Management We recognize the criticality of managing operational risk on both a strategic and day-to-day basis and that there are heightened expectations from our regulators and our customers. We have implemented appropriate operational risk management policies, standards, processes and controls to enable the delivery of high quality and consistent customer experiences and to achieve business objectives in a controlled manner. The Chief Operational Risk Officer is responsible for establishing and overseeing our Operational Risk Management Program. The program establishes practices for assessing the operational risk profile and executing key control processes for operational risks. These risks include topics such as internal and external fraud, cyber and technology risk, data management, model risk, third party management, and business continuity. Operational Risk Management enforces these practices and delivers reporting of operational risk results to senior business leaders, the executive committee and the Board of Directors. Reputation Risk Management We recognize that reputation risk is of particular concern for financial institutions and, increasingly, technology companies, in the current environment. Areas of concern have expanded to include company policies, practices and values and, with the growing use of social and digital platforms, public corporations face a new level of scrutiny and channels for activism and advocacy. The heightened expectations of internal and external stakeholders have made corporate culture, values and conduct pressure points for individuals and advocates voicing concerns or seeking change. We manage both strategic and tactical reputation issues and build our relationships with government officials, media, community and consumer advocates, customers and other constituencies to help strengthen the reputations of both our Company and industry. Our actions include implementing pro-customer practices in our business and serving low to moderate income communities in our market area consistent with a quality bank and an innovative technology leader. The Executive Vice President of External Affairs is responsible for managing our overall reputation risk program. Day-to-day activities are controlled by the frameworks set forth in our Reputation Risk Management Policy and other risk management policies. Strategic Risk Management We monitor external market and industry developments to identify potential areas of strategic opportunity or risk. These inform the Company strategy, which is led by the Chief Executive Officer and other senior executives. The Chief Risk Officer identifies and assesses risks associated with the Company strategy across all risk categories and monitors these risks throughout the year. 80 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Our Strategic Risk Management Policy, processes and controls encompass an ongoing assessment of risks associated with corporate or line of business specific strategies. These risks are managed through periodic reviews, along with regular updates to senior management and the Board. CREDIT RISK PROFILE Our loan portfolio accounts for the substantial majority of our credit risk exposure. Our lending activities are governed under our credit policy and are subject to independent review and approval. Below we provide information about the composition of our loan portfolio, key concentrations and credit performance metrics. We also engage in certain non-lending activities that may give rise to ongoing credit and counterparty settlement risk, including purchasing securities for our investment securities portfolio, entering into derivative transactions to manage our market risk exposure and to accommodate customers, extending short-term advances on syndication activity including bridge financing transactions we have underwritten, depositing certain operational cash balances in other financial institutions, executing certain foreign exchange transactions and extending customer overdrafts.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 2 Investment Securities as well as credit risk related to derivative transactions in Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 9 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Primary Loan Products We provide a variety of lending products. Our primary loan products include credit cards, auto loans and commercial lending products. Credit cards: We originate both prime and subprime credit cards through a variety of channels. Our credit cards generally have variable interest rates. Credit card accounts are primarily underwritten using an automated underwriting system based on predictive models that we have developed. The underwriting criteria, which are customized for individual products and marketing programs, are established based on an analysis of the net present value of expected revenues, expenses and losses, subject to further analysis using a variety of stress conditions. Underwriting decisions are generally based on credit bureau information, including payment history, debt burden and credit scores, such as FICO scores, and on other factors, such as applicant income. We maintain a credit card securitization program and selectively sell charged-off credit card loans. Auto: We originate both prime and subprime auto loans through a network of auto dealers and direct marketing. Our auto loans generally have fixed interest rates and loan terms of 75 months or less, but can go up to 84 months. Loan size limits are customized by program and are generally less than $75,000. Similar to credit card accounts, the underwriting criteria are customized for individual products and marketing programs and based on analysis of net present value of expected revenues, expenses and losses, and are subject to maintaining resilience under a variety of stress conditions. Underwriting decisions are generally based on an applicant income, estimated net disposable income, and credit bureau information including FICO scores, along with collateral characteristics such as loan-to-value ( LTV ) ratio. We maintain an auto securitization program. Commercial: We offer a range of commercial lending products, including loans secured by commercial real estate and loans to middle market commercial and industrial companies. Our commercial loans may have a fixed or variable interest rate; however, the majority of our commercial loans have variable rates. Our underwriting standards require an analysis of the borrower financial condition and prospects, as well as an assessment of the industry in which the borrower operates. Where relevant, we evaluate and appraise underlying collateral and guarantees. We maintain underwriting guidelines and limits for major types of borrowers and loan products that specify, where applicable, guidelines for debt service coverage, leverage, LTV ratio and standard covenants and conditions. We assign a risk rating and establish a monitoring schedule for loans based on the risk profile of the borrower, industry segment, source of repayment, the underlying collateral and guarantees, if any, and current market conditions. Although we generally retain the commercial loans we underwrite, we may syndicate positions for risk mitigation purposes, including bridge financing transactions we have underwritten. In addition, we originate and service multifamily commercial real estate loans which are sold to government-sponsored enterprises. 81 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Portfolio and Geographic Composition of Loans Held for Investment Our loan portfolio consists of loans held for investment, including loans held in our consolidated trusts, and loans held for sale.

Industry classifications below are based on our interpretation of the North American Industry Classification System codes as they pertain to each individual loan.

Trends in delinquency rates are the key credit quality indicator for our credit card and retail banking loan portfolios as changes in delinquency rates can provide an early warning of changes in potential future credit losses. The key indicator we monitor when assessing the credit quality and risk of our auto loan portfolio is borrower credit scores as they provide insight into borrower risk profiles, which give indications of potential future credit losses. The key credit quality indicator for our commercial loan portfolios is our internal risk ratings as we generally classify loans that have been delinquent for an extended period of time and other loans with significant risk of loss as nonperforming. In addition to these credit quality indicators, we also manage and monitor other credit quality metrics such as level of nonperforming loans and net charge-off rates. We underwrite most consumer loans using proprietary models, which typically include credit bureau data, such as borrower credit scores, application information and, where applicable, collateral and deal structure data. We continuously adjust our management of credit lines and collection strategies based on customer behavior and risk profile changes. We also use borrower credit scores for subprime classification, for competitive benchmarking and, in some cases, to drive product segmentation decisions. Table 21 provides details on the credit scores of our domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Domestic Card credit scores generally represent FICO scores. These scores are obtained from one of the major credit bureaus at origination and are refreshed monthly thereafter. We approximate non-FICO credit scores to comparable FICO scores for consistency purposes. Balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 660 or below category. (2) Percentages represent period-end loans held for investment in each credit score category. Auto credit scores generally represent average FICO scores obtained from three credit bureaus at the time of application and are not refreshed thereafter. Balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 620 or below category. We present information in the section below on the credit performance of our loan portfolio, including the key metrics we use in tracking changes in the credit quality of our loan portfolio. See Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 3 Loans for additional credit quality information and see Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for information on our accounting policies for delinquent and nonperforming loans, charge-offs and troubled debt restructurings ( TDRs ) for each of our loan categories. Delinquency Rates We consider the entire balance of an account to be delinquent if the minimum required payment is not received by the customer due date, measured at each balance sheet date. Our 30+ day delinquency metrics include all loans held for investment that are 30 or more days past due, whereas our 30+ day performing delinquency metrics include all loans held for investment that are 30 or more days past due but are currently classified as performing and accruing interest. The 30+ day delinquency and 30+ day performing delinquency metrics are the same for domestic credit card loans, as we continue to classify these loans as performing until the account is charged off, typically when the account is 180 days past due. See Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for information on our policies for classifying loans as nonperforming for each of our loan categories.

Interest income foregone related to nonperforming loans was $83 million and $51 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Foregone interest income represents the amount of interest income in excess of recognized interest income that would have been recorded during the period for nonperforming loans as of the end of the period had the loans performed according to their contractual terms. (2) Nonperforming loan rates are calculated based on nonperforming loans for each category divided by period-end total loans held for investment for each respective category. 88 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents (3) Excluding the impact of domestic credit card loans, nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans held for investment was 0.74% and 0.65% as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. (4) The denominators used in calculating nonperforming asset rates consist of total loans held for investment and other nonperforming assets. Net Charge-Offs Net charge-offs consist of the amortized cost basis, excluding accrued interest, of loans held for investment that we determine to be uncollectible, net of recovered amounts. We charge off loans as a reduction to the allowance for credit losses when we determine the loan is uncollectible and record subsequent recoveries of previously charged off amounts as increases to the allowance for credit losses. Uncollectible finance charges and fees are reversed through revenue and certain fraud losses are recorded in other non-interest expense. Generally, costs to recover charged off loans are recorded as collection expenses as incurred and are included in our consolidated statements of income as a component of other non-interest expense. Our charge-off policy for loans varies based on the loan type. See Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for information on our charge-off policy for each of our loan categories. Table 26 presents our net charge-off amounts and rates, by portfolio segment, in 2022, 2021 and 2020.

Troubled Debt Restructurings As part of our loss mitigation efforts, we may provide short-term (one to twelve months) or long-term (greater than twelve months) modifications to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty to improve long-term collectability of the loan and to avoid the need for repossession or foreclosure of collateral. We consider the impact of all loan modifications, whether or not that modification is classified as a TDR, when estimating the credit quality of our loan portfolio and establishing allowance levels. For our Commercial Banking customers, loan modifications are also considered in the assignment of an internal risk rating. In our Credit Card business, the majority of our credit card loans modified as TDRs involve reducing the interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months. The effective interest rate on the loan immediately prior to the loan modification is used as the effective interest rate for purposes of measuring impairment using the present value of expected cash flows. 89 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents If the customer does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan agreement may revert to its original payment terms, generally resulting in any loan outstanding being reflected in the appropriate delinquency category and charged off in accordance with our standard charge-off policy. In our Consumer Banking business, the majority of our loans modified as TDRs receive an extension, an interest rate reduction, principal reduction, or a combination of these modifications. In addition, TDRs also occur in connection with bankruptcy of the borrower. In certain bankruptcy discharges, the loan is written down to the collateral value and the charged off amount is reported as principal reduction. Impairment is determined using the present value of expected cash flows or a collateral evaluation for certain auto loans where the collateral value is lower than the amortized cost. In our Commercial Banking business, the majority of loans modified as TDRs receive an extension, with a portion of these loans receiving an interest rate reduction or a gross balance reduction. The impairment on modified commercial loans is generally determined based on the underlying collateral value. As part of our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we offered programs to accommodate customer hardship across our lines of business beginning in the first quarter of 2020. Our COVID-19 programs were designed to be short-term accommodations so that we could provide our customers with prompt relief. Also in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, additional guidance was issued by the Federal Banking Agencies and contained in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ( CARES Act ) which provided banking organizations with TDR relief for loan modifications to certain qualifying borrowers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. While the majority of enrollments in our COVID-19 programs were short-term and would generally not have resulted in TDR classification under our existing policies, some of these modification would have been designated as TDRs without the relief provided by the additional guidance issued by the Federal Banking Agencies and contained in the CARES Act. Therefore, the expiry of the guidance in the CARES Act on January 1, 2022, along with our concurrent cessation in applying the additional guidance issued by the Federal Banking Agencies, drove an increase in reported TDRs for periods ending after December 31, 2021. Table 27 presents our amortized cost of loans modified in TDRs as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, which excludes loan modifications that do not meet the definition of a TDR.

Expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off or expected to be charged off are recognized within the allowance. We also estimate expected credit losses related to unfunded lending commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable. The provision for losses on unfunded lending commitments is included in the provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of income and the related reserve for unfunded lending commitments is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We provide additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used in determining our allowance for credit losses in Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Table 28 presents changes in our allowance for credit losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments for 2022 and 2021, and details by portfolio segment for the provision for credit losses, charge-offs and recoveries.

(2) Primarily represents foreign currency translation adjustments and the initial allowance for purchased credit-deteriorated loans. The initial allowance for purchased credit-deteriorated loans was $10 million and $6 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 91 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Allowance coverage ratios are calculated based on the allowance for credit losses for each specified portfolio segment divided by period-end loans held for investment within the specified loan category, as defined below. Table 29 presents the allowance coverage ratios as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Table 29: Allowance Coverage Ratios for Specified Loan Category December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 (Dollars in millions) Allowance for Credit Losses Amount (1) Allowance Coverage Ratio Allowance for Credit Losses Amount (1) Allowance Coverage Ratio Credit Card $ 9,545 $ 4,769 200.16 % $ 8,345 $ 2,624 318.08 % Consumer Banking 2,237 4,940 45.27 1,918 3,618 53.01 Commercial Banking 1,458 701 207.73 1,167 699 166.93 Total $ 13,240 312,331 4.24 $ 11,430 277,340 4.12 __________ (1) Represents period-end 30+ day delinquent loans for our credit card and consumer banking loan portfolios, nonperforming loans for our commercial banking loan portfolio and total loans held for investment for the total ratio. O ur allowance for credit losses increased by $1.8 billion to $13.2 billion as of December 31, 2022 compared to 2021 and our allowance coverage ratio increased by 12 basis points to 4.24% as of December 31, 2022 compared to 2021. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses divided by total nonperforming loans held for investment of $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, decreased by 54% to 985% as of December 31, 2022 from 1,039% as of December 31, 2021. Excluding the impact of the allowance for credit losses related to Domestic Card of $9.2 billion and $8.0 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, this ratio decreased by 12% to 303% as of December 31, 2022 from 315% as of December 31, 2021. The decrease in the ratio in both scenarios was driven by an increase in our nonperforming loans partially offset by an increase in our allowance for credit losses driven by credit normalization and loan growth. LIQUIDITY RISK PROFILE We have established liquidity practices that are intended to ensure that we have sufficient asset-based liquidity to cover our funding requirements and maintain adequate reserves to withstand the potential impact of deposit attrition or diminished liquidity in the funding markets. In addition to our cash and cash equivalents, we maintain reserves in the form of investment securities and certain loans that are either readily-marketable or pledgeable. Table 30 below presents the composition of our liquidity reserves as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Table 30: Liquidity Reserves (Dollars in millions) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Cash and cash equivalents $ 30,856 $ 21,746 Investment securities available for sale, at fair value 76,919 95,261 FHLB borrowing capacity secured by loans 6,436 7,109 Outstanding FHLB advances and letters of credit secured by loans and investment securities (51) (8) Other encumbrances of investment securities (7,583) (7,874) Total liquidity reserves $ 106,577 $ 116,234 Our liquidity reserves decreased by $9.7 billion to $106.6 billion as of December 31, 2022 from December 31, 2021 primarily due to a decline in our investment securities that more than offset an increase in cash and cash equivalents. In addition to these liquidity reserves, we maintain access to a diversified mix of funding sources as discussed in the Borrowing Capacity and Funding sections below. See Risk Management for additional information on our management of liquidity risk. 92 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Liquidity Coverage Ratio We are subject to the LCR Rule as implemented by the Federal Reserve and OCC. The LCR Rule requires each of the Company and the Bank to calculate its respective LCR daily. It also requires the Company to publicly disclose, on a quarterly basis, its LCR, certain related quantitative liquidity metrics, and a qualitative discussion of its LCR. Our average LCR during fourth quarter 2022 was 143% , which exceeded the LCR Rule requirement of 100%. The calculation and the underlying components are based on our interpretations, expectations and assumptions of relevant regulations, as well as interpretations provided by our regulators, and are subject to change based on changes to future regulations and interpretations. See Part I Item 1. Business Supervision and Regulation for additional information. Net Stable Funding Ratio The NSFR rule requires the Company and the Bank to maintain an amount of available stable funding, which is a weighted measure of a company funding sources over a one-year time horizon, calculated by applying standardized weightings to equity and liabilities based on their expected stability, that is no less than a specified percentage of its required stable funding, which is calculated by applying standardized weightings to assets, derivatives exposures and certain other items based on their liquidity characteristics. As a Category III institution, the Company and the Bank are each required to maintain available stable funding in an amount at least equal to 85% of its required stable funding. The NSFR rule includes a semi-annual public disclosure requirement, with the first disclosure due 45 days after the end of the second quarter of 2023 . The Company and the Bank exceeded the NSFR rule requirement as of December 31, 2022. Borrowing Capacity We maintain a shelf registration with the SEC so that we may periodically offer and sell an indeterminate aggregate amount of senior or subordinated debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock, purchase contracts, warrants and units. There is no limit under this shelf registration to the amount or number of such securities that we may offer and sell, subject to market conditions. In addition, we also maintain a shelf registration associated with our credit card securitization trust that allows us to periodically offer and sell up to $30 billion of securitized debt obligations and a shelf registration associated with our auto loan securitization trusts that allows us to periodically offer and sell up to $25 billion of securitized debt obligations. The registered amounts under these shelf registration statements are subject to continuing review and change in the future, including as part of the routine renewal process. In addition to our issuance capacity under the shelf registration statements, we also have access to FHLB advances, the Federal Reserve Discount Window and the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation general collateral financing repurchase agreement service. The ability to borrow utilizing these sources is based on membership status and the amount is dependent upon the Bank ability to post collateral. As of December 31, 2022, we pledged both loans and securities to the FHLB to secure a maximum borrowing capacity of $19.9 billion, of which $51 million was used. Our FHLB membership is supported by our investment in FHLB stock of $15 million and $32 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which was determined in part based on our outstanding advances. As of December 31, 2022, we pledged loans to secure a borrowing capacity of $19.7 billion under the Federal Reserve Discount Window. Our membership with the Federal Reserve is supported by our investment in Federal Reserve stock, which totaled $1.3 billion as of both December 31, 2022 and 2021. 93 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Deposits Table 31 provides a comparison of average balances, interest expense and average deposits interest rates for December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.

The FDIC limits the acceptance of brokered deposits to well-capitalized insured depository institutions and, with a waiver from the FDIC, to adequately-capitalized institutions. The Bank was well-capitalized, as defined under the federal banking regulatory guidelines, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. See Part I Item 1. Business Supervision and Regulation for additional information. We provide additional information on the composition of deposits in Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis Funding Sources Composition and in Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 8 Deposits and Borrowings. Funding Our primary source of funding comes from deposits, as they are a stable and relatively low cost source of funding. In addition to deposits, we raise funding through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes and securitized debt obligations, federal funds purchased, securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase and FHLB advances secured by certain portions of our loan and securities portfolios. A key objective in our use of these markets is to maintain access to a diversified mix of wholesale funding sources. See Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis Funding Sources Composition for additional information on our primary sources of funding. In the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments that affect our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. Our future cash outflows primarily relate to deposits, borrowings and operating leases. The actual timing and amounts of future cash payments may vary over time due to a number of factors, such as early debt redemptions and changes in deposit balances. 94 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, excluding intercompany balances, we held approximately $80.7 billion and $91.7 billion, respectively, of uninsured deposits primarily comprised of checking accounts and savings deposits. We estimate our uninsured amounts at the account level based on the same methodologies and assumptions used for our Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (FFIEC 031) filed with the Federal Banking Agencies. Table 32 presents, by contractual maturity, the amount of time deposits in excess of the FDIC insurance limit of $250,000 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Our funding and liquidity management activities factor into the expected maturities of these deposits.

In addition, we have access to short-term and long-term FHLB advances secured by certain investment securities, multifamily real estate loans and commercial real estate loans. Our short-term borrowings, which include those borrowings with an original contractual maturity of one year or less, consisting of federal funds purchased, securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase and short-term FHLB advances, and do not include the current portion of long-term debt, increased by $63 million to $883 million as of December 31, 2022 from December 31, 2021 driven by an increase in repurchase agreements. Our long-term funding, which primarily consists of securitized debt obligations and senior and subordinated notes, increased by $5.6 billion to $47.8 billion as of December 31, 2022 from December 31, 2021 primarily driven by net issuances of senior unsecured debt and net issuances in our auto and credit card securitization programs. We provide more information on our securitization activity in Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 5 Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations and on our borrowings in Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 8 Deposits and Borrowings.

Rating agencies assign their ratings based on numerous factors, including liquidity, capital adequacy, asset quality, quality of earnings and the probability of systemic support. Significant changes in these factors could result in different ratings. Table 34 provides a summary of the credit ratings for the senior unsecured long-term debt of Capital One Financial Corporation and CONA as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Table 34: Senior Unsecured Long-Term Debt Credit Ratings December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Capital One Financial Corporation CONA Capital One Financial Corporation CONA Moody Baa1 A3 Baa1 A3 S&P BBB BBB+ BBB BBB+ Fitch A- A A- A As of February 16, 2023, Moody Investors Service ( Moody ), Standard & Poor ( S&P ) and Fitch Ratings ( Fitch ) have our credit ratings on a stable outlook. Other Commitments Our primary involvement with leases is in the capacity as a lessee where we lease premises to support our business. The majority of our leases are operating leases of office space, retail bank branches and caf s. Our operating leases expire at various dates through 2071, although some have extension or termination options. As of both December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had $1.7 billion in aggregate operating lease liabilities, of which $259 million will be due in the following 12 months. We provide more information on our lease activity in Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 7 Premises, Equipment and Leases. We have purchase obligations that represent substantial agreements to purchase goods or receive services such as data management, media and other software and third-party services that are enforceable and legally binding and specify significant terms. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had $1.1 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, in aggregate purchase obligation liabilities. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, our total unfunded lending commitments were $409.3 billion and $414.5 billion, respectively, primarily consisting of credit card lines and loan commitments to customers of both our Commercial Banking and Consumer Banking businesses, as well as standby and commercial letters of credit. We generally manage the potential risk of unfunded lending commitments by limiting the total amount of arrangements, monitoring the size and maturity structure of these portfolios and applying the same credit standards for all of our credit activities. For additional information, refer to Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 18 Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others. We also enter into various contractual arrangements that may require future cash payments, including short-term obligations such as trade payables, commitments to fund certain equity investments, obligations for pension and post-retirement benefit plans, and representation and warranty reserves. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 5 Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations, Part II Item 8.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 18 Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others. 96 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents MARKET RISK PROFILE Our primary market risk exposures include interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and commodity pricing risk. We are exposed to market risk primarily from the following operations and activities: Traditional banking activities of deposit gathering and lending; Asset/liability management activities including the management of investment securities, short-term and long-term borrowings and derivatives; Foreign operations in the U.K. and Canada within our Credit Card business; and Customer accommodation activities within our Commercial Banking business. We have enterprise-wide risk management policies and limits, approved by our Board of Directors, which govern our market risk management activities. Our objective is to manage our exposure to market risk in accordance with these policies and limits based on prevailing market conditions and long-term expectations. We provide additional information below about our primary sources of market risk, our market risk management strategies and the measures that we use to evaluate these exposures. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk represents exposure to financial instruments whose values vary with the level or volatility of interest rates. We are exposed to interest rate risk primarily from the differences in the timing between the maturities or re-pricing of assets and liabilities. We manage our interest rate risk primarily by entering into interest rate swaps and other derivative instruments which could include caps, floors, options, futures and forward contracts. We use various industry standard market risk measurement techniques and analyses to measure, assess and manage the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and our economic value of equity and changes in foreign exchange rates on our non-dollar-denominated funding and non-dollar equity investments in foreign operations. Net Interest Income Sensitivity Our net interest income sensitivity measure estimates the impact on our projected 12-month baseline net interest income resulting from movements in interest rates. In addition to our existing assets and liabilities, we incorporate expected future business growth assumptions, such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, and plans for projected changes in our funding mix in our baseline forecast. In measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our projected net interest income, we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates detailed in Table 35 below. At the current level of interest rates, our net interest income is expected to increase in higher rate scenarios and decrease in lower rate scenarios. Our current sensitivity to upward shocks has decreased as compared to December 31, 2021, mainly due to the increase in market interest rates. Economic Value of Equity Sensitivity Our economic value of equity sensitivity measure estimates the impact on the net present value of our assets and liabilities, including derivative exposures, resulting from movements in interest rates. Our economic value of equity sensitivity measure is calculated based on our existing assets and liabilities, including derivatives, and does not incorporate business growth assumptions or projected balance sheet changes. Key assumptions used in the calculation include projecting rate sensitive prepayments for mortgage securities, loans and other assets, term structure modeling of interest rates, discount spreads, and deposit volume and pricing assumptions. In measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our economic value of equity, we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates detailed in Table 35 below. Our current economic value of equity sensitivity profile demonstrates that our economic value of equity decreases in higher interest rate scenarios and increases in most lower interest rate scenarios. Our current economic value of equity sensitivity to upward shocks in higher rate scenarios became more negative as compared to December 31, 2021, mainly due to the increase in long-term interest rates. 97 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 35 shows the estimated percentage impact on our projected baseline net interest income and economic value of equity calculated under the methodology described above as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. In instances where an interest rate scenario would result in a rate less than 0%, we assume a rate of 0% for that scenario. This assumption applies only to jurisdictions that do not have negative policy rates. In jurisdictions that have negative policy rates, we do not floor interest rates at 0%. Table 35: Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Estimated impact on projected baseline net interest income: +200 basis points 0.4 % 3.4 % +100 basis points 0.8 2.5 +50 basis points 0.4 1.5 50 basis points (0.7) (1.8) 100 basis points (1.3) N/A 200 basis points (2.6) N/A Estimated impact on economic value of equity: +200 basis points (4.3) (0.7) +100 basis points (1.5) 1.9 +50 basis points (0.7) 1.4 50 basis points 0.4 (2.6) 100 basis points 0.6 N/A 200 basis points (0.2) N/A In addition to these industry standard measures, we also consider the potential impact of alternative interest rate scenarios, such as stressed rate shocks as well as steepening and flattening yield curve scenarios in our internal interest rate risk management decisions. Limitations of Market Risk Measures The interest rate risk models that we use in deriving these measures incorporate contractual information, internally-developed assumptions and proprietary modeling methodologies, which project borrower and depositor behavior patterns in certain interest rate environments. Other market inputs, such as interest rates, market prices and interest rate volatility, are also critical components of our interest rate risk measures. We regularly evaluate, update and enhance these assumptions, models and analytical tools as we believe appropriate to reflect our best assessment of the market environment and the expected behavior patterns of our existing assets and liabilities. There are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates. The sensitivity analysis described above contemplates only certain movements in interest rates and is performed at a particular point in time based on our existing balance sheet and, in some cases, expected future business growth and funding mix assumptions. The strategic actions that management may take to manage our balance sheet may differ significantly from our projections, which could cause our actual earnings and economic value of equity sensitivities to differ substantially from the above sensitivity analysis. For further information on our interest rate exposures, see Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 9 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. 98 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Foreign Exchange Risk Foreign exchange risk represents exposure to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in other currencies. We are exposed to foreign exchange risk primarily from the intercompany funding denominated in pound sterling ( GBP ) and the Canadian dollar ( CAD ) that we provide to our businesses in the U.K. and Canada and net equity investments in those businesses. We are also exposed to foreign exchange risk due to changes in the dollar-denominated value of future earnings and cash flows from our foreign operations and from our Euro ( EUR )-denominated borrowings. Our non-dollar denominated intercompany funding and EUR-denominated borrowings expose our earnings to foreign exchange transaction risk. We manage these transaction risks by using forward foreign currency derivatives and cross-currency swaps to hedge our exposures. We measure our foreign exchange transaction risk exposures by applying a 1% U.S. dollar appreciation shock against the value of the non-dollar denominated intercompany funding and EUR-denominated borrowings and their related hedges, which shows the impact to our earnings from foreign exchange risk. Our nominal intercompany funding outstanding was 785 million GBP and 520 million GBP as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and 1.7 billion CAD and 5.0 billion CAD as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our nominal EUR-denominated borrowings outstanding were 1.3 billion EUR and 1.2 billion EUR as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our non-dollar equity investments in foreign operations expose our balance sheet to translation risk in AOCI and our capital ratios. We manage our AOCI exposure by entering into foreign currency derivatives designated as net investment hedges. We measure these exposures by applying a 30% U.S. dollar appreciation shock, which we believe approximates a significant adverse shock over a one-year time horizon, against the value of the equity invested in our foreign operations net of related net investment hedges where applicable. Our gross equity exposures in our U.K. and Canadian operations were 1.9 billion GBP and 1.8 billion GBP as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively and 2.2 billion CAD and 1.9 billion CAD as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As a result of our derivative management activities, we believe our net exposure to foreign exchange risk is minimal. Risk related to Customer Accommodation Derivatives We offer interest rate, commodity and foreign currency derivatives as an accommodation to our customers within our Commercial Banking business. We offset the majority of the market risk of these customer accommodation derivatives by entering into offsetting derivatives transactions with other counterparties. We use value-at-risk ( VaR ) as the primary method to measure the market risk in our customer accommodation derivative activities on a daily basis. VaR is a statistical risk measure used to estimate the potential loss from movements observed in the recent market environment. We employ a historical simulation approach using the most recent 500 business days and use a 99 percent confidence level and a holding period of one business day. As a result of offsetting our customer exposures with other counterparties, we believe that our net exposure to market risk in our customer accommodation derivatives is minimal. For further information on our risk related to customer accommodation derivatives, see Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 9 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. London Interbank Offered Rate Transition On July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority ( FCA ), the regulator for the administration of LIBOR, announced that LIBOR would be phased out as an interest rate benchmark and that it will no longer compel panel banks to contribute LIBOR data beyond December 31, 2021. On March 5, 2021, the ICE Benchmark Administration ( IBA ), the administrator of LIBOR, confirmed its intention to cease publication of the 1-week and 2-month U.S. dollar ( USD ) LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on December 31, 2021, and the remaining USD LIBOR tenors (overnight; 1, 3, 6, and 12 months) immediately following the LIBOR publication on June 30, 2023. The continuation of USD LIBOR as a representative rate into mid-2023 will allow many legacy USD LIBOR contracts to mature prior to cessation. Following IBA announcement, the FCA formally announced the future permanent cessation and loss of representativeness of LIBOR benchmarks. The Federal Banking Agencies issued further guidance that banking organizations should cease using USD LIBOR as a reference rate in new contracts as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021. Consistent with the Federal Banking Agencies guidance, we ceased entering into new contracts referencing USD LIBOR as a reference rate as of January 1, 2022, subject to certain permissible exceptions. On December 16, 2022, the Federal Reserve Board adopted the final rule that implemented the LIBOR Act. The LIBOR Act identified benchmark replacement rates based on SOFR for covered derivative transactions and cash transactions where a 99 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents practicable interest rate fallback method has not been established by June 30, 2023, including those in which a government-sponsored enterprise is a party. Our LIBOR transition effort remains focused on proactively transitioning exposures to an alternative rate or incorporating transition language ( fallback language ) to provide a contractual mechanism for transitioning upon the LIBOR cessation. Our fallback language aligns with the language recommended by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee ( ARRC ) in our lending contracts and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association ( ISDA ) in our derivative contracts and agreements to the greatest extent possible. Our enterprise LIBOR transition program team, which has been working on this effort since 2018 and includes senior management representatives from across the enterprise, provides monthly reporting to senior management and quarterly reporting to our Board of Directors. The information provided to senior management and the Board of Directors includes exposure reporting, updates on progress toward our goals to reduce our LIBOR exposure and relevant regulatory or industry developments. We continue to focus our LIBOR transition efforts on: monitoring established controls to prevent the origination of impermissible LIBOR indexed instruments working with impacted customers and counterparties to remediate remaining LIBOR contracts and our central counterparty clearinghouses and derivative clearinghouses for conversion of centrally cleared USD LIBOR products engaging with our clients, industry working groups, and regulators preparing to transition remaining contracts, including those with hardwired fallback language, operable legacy fallback language and those covered under the scope of the LIBOR Act. The majority of LIBOR contracts that we have transitioned to alternative rates have employed SOFR. In the U.S., SOFR has been selected as the preferred alternative rate by the ARRC for certain U.S. dollar derivative and cash instruments. We have proactively worked with customers and prepared our systems, models, valuation tools and processes to focus originations on SOFR and other non-LIBOR rates and will continue to do so as needed. While the majority of our non-LIBOR transactions have utilized SOFR, we have also employed credit sensitive alternative rates to LIBOR, to a limited extent, in response to customer demand. To track transition status, instruments are categorized based on whether they have fallback language (which may or may not adhere to the ISDA and ARRC standards) or have no fallback language. The majority of the instruments maturing after June 30, 2023 are derivatives and commercial loans, which are summarized in the table below. Of these instruments, the majority contain fallback language which adheres to the ISDA and ARRC standards. The LIBOR Act provides a means for transitioning certain contracts that lack fallback language and which we are not able to otherwise remediate prior to LIBOR cessation. We will continue to focus on reducing our LIBOR exposures through our transition efforts, normal operations and customer interactions.
