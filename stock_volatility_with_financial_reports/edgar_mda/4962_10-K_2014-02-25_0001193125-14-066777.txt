FINANCIAL REVIEW

The financial section of American Express Company’s Annual Report consists of this Financial Review, the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following discussion is designed to provide perspective and understanding regarding the consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Certain key terms are defined in the Glossary of Selected Terminology.

This Financial Review and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements exclude discontinued operations unless otherwise noted.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

BUSINESS INTRODUCTION

American Express Company (the Company) is a global services company, comprised of four reportable operating segments: U.S. Card Services (USCS), International Card Services (ICS), Global Commercial Services (GCS) and Global Network and Merchant Services (GNMS). The Company provides customers with access to products, insights and experiences that enrich lives and build business success. The Company’s principal products and services are charge and credit payment card products and travel-related services offered to consumers and businesses around the world. The Company’s range of products and services includes:

 

•	 	
charge and credit card products;

 

•	 	
expense management products and services;

 

•	 	
consumer and business travel services;

 

•	 	
stored-value products such as Travelers Cheques and other prepaid products;

 

•	 	
network services;

 

•	 	
merchant acquisition and processing, servicing and settlement, and point-of-sale, marketing and information products and services for merchants; and

 

•	 	
fee services, including fraud prevention services and the design of customized customer loyalty and rewards programs.

The Company’s products and services are sold globally to diverse customer groups, including consumers, small businesses, mid-sized companies and large corporations. These products and services are sold through various channels, including direct mail, online applications, in-house and third-party sales forces and direct response advertising.

The Company competes in the global payments industry with charge, credit and debit card networks, issuers and acquirers, as well as evolving alternative payment mechanisms, systems and products. As the payments industry continues to evolve, the Company is facing increasing competition from non-traditional players that leverage new technologies and customers’ existing card accounts and bank relationships to create payment or other fee-based solutions. The Company is transforming its existing businesses and creating new products and services for the digital marketplace as it seeks to enhance its customers’ digital experiences and develop platforms for online and mobile commerce. Emerging technologies also provide an opportunity to deliver financial products and services that help new and existing customer segments move and manage their money, which we are pursuing through our Enterprise Growth Group (EGG).

The Company’s products and services generate the following types of revenue for the Company:

 

•	 	
Discount revenue, the Company’s largest revenue source, which represents fees generally charged to merchants when Card Members use their cards to purchase goods and services at merchants on the Company’s network;

 

•	 	
Net card fees, which represent revenue earned for annual card membership fees;

 

•	 	
Travel commissions and fees, which are earned by charging a transaction or management fee to both customers and suppliers for travel-related transactions;

 

•	 	
Other commissions and fees, which are earned on foreign exchange conversions, card-related fees and assessments and other service fees;

 

•	 	
Other revenue, which represents revenues arising from contracts with partners of our Global Network Services (GNS) business (including royalties and signing fees), insurance premiums earned from Card Member travel and other insurance programs, Travelers Cheques and prepaid card-related revenues and other miscellaneous revenue and fees; and

 

•	 	
Interest on loans, which principally represents interest income earned on outstanding balances.

In addition to funding and operating costs associated with these types of revenue, other major expense categories are related to marketing and rewards programs that add new Card Members and promote Card Member loyalty and spending, and provisions for Card Member credit and fraud losses.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

For 2013, the Company reported net income of $5.4 billion and diluted earnings per share of $4.88. This compared to $4.5 billion of net income and $3.89 diluted earnings per share for 2012 and $4.9 billion of net income and $4.09 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for 2011.

2013 included a fourth quarter charge of $66 million ($41 million after-tax) related to a proposed merchant litigation settlement.

•

•	 	
$153 million ($106 million after-tax) of net charges for costs related to reengineering initiatives; and

 

•	 	
Tax benefits of $102 million and $77 million related to the favorable resolution of certain prior years’ tax items and the realization of certain foreign tax credits, respectively.

FINANCIAL TARGETS

The Company seeks to achieve three financial targets, on average and over time:

 

•	 	
Revenues net of interest expense growth of at least 8 percent;

 

•	 	
Earnings per share (EPS) growth of 12 to 15 percent; and

 

•	 	
Return on average equity (ROE) of 25 percent or more.

If the Company achieves its EPS and ROE targets, it will seek to return on average and over time approximately 50 percent of the capital it generates to shareholders as dividends or through the repurchases of common stock, which may be subject to certain regulatory restrictions as described herein.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND NON-GAAP MEASURES

Certain of the statements in this Annual Report are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Refer to the “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” section.

The Company prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). However, certain information included within this Annual Report constitute non-GAAP financial measures. The Company’s calculations of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the calculations of similarly titled measures by other companies.

BANK HOLDING COMPANY

The Company is a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and the Federal Reserve Board (Federal Reserve) is the Company’s primary federal regulator. As such, the Company is subject to the Federal Reserve’s regulations, policies and minimum capital standards.

CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT/OUTLOOK

The Company’s results for 2013 reflect healthy spending growth, continuing strong credit quality, effective control of operating expenses and a strong capital position. Despite a challenging economic environment, billed business grew 7 percent over the prior year. Card Member billed business volumes grew both in the U.S. and internationally, and across all of the Company’s businesses.

The Company’s average loans also continued to grow year over year, which, along with a higher net yield and a lower cost of funds, led to a 9 percent increase in net interest income. At the same time, lending write-off rates remained at historically low levels. While the Company expects lending write-off rates will increase from such levels, the Company has not experienced overall credit deterioration, as total delinquency rates remained consistently low during the year.

The Company effectively controlled its expenses, with total expenses decreasing 1 percent over the prior year. The Company continued to invest in growth opportunities in the U.S. and internationally as marketing and promotion expense grew by 5 percent as compared to the prior year. Operating expenses decreased 4 percent as compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of the restructuring charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2012, adjusted operating expenses were flat year over year.1 The Company’s aim is to have operating expenses grow at an annual rate of less than 3 percent in 2014.

As discussed below within Certain Legislative, Regulatory and Other Developments, the regulatory environment continues to evolve and has heightened the focus that all financial services firms, including the Company, must have on their controls and processes. The review of products and practices will be a continuing focus of the Company, as well as by regulators. In addition, regulation of the payments industry has increased significantly in recent years and governments in several countries have established or are proposing to establish payment system regulatory regimes.

 

1  	Adjusted operating expenses, a non-GAAP measure, is calculated by excluding from 2012 operating expenses of $13.2 billion the $400 million restructuring charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2012. The year over year growth rate is calculated by comparing 2012 adjusted operating expenses of $12.8 billion with 2013 operating expenses of $12.7 billion. Management believes adjusted operating expenses is a useful metric to evaluate the Company’s performance against its operating expense goal for 2013.

2013 FINANCIAL REVIEW

 

Competition remains extremely intense across the Company’s businesses. While the Company’s business is diversified, including the corporate card business, a large international business and GNS partners around the world, the global economic environment remains challenging. In addition, any impact of potential U.S. income tax law changes or volatility in foreign exchange rates remains uncertain.

As announced during the third quarter of 2013, the Company plans to create a new joint venture for its Global Business Travel (GBT) operations. It is expected that GBT’s operations, business relationships and other assets would be held and operated by the joint venture entity. As presently contemplated, at the closing of the transaction the Company would maintain an approximate 50 percent ownership stake in the joint venture, while an investor group would own the remaining interest. The transaction remains subject to the execution of definitive agreements and receipt of regulatory and other approvals. Assuming these conditions are met, the Company would plan to close the transaction in the second quarter of 2014. The Company would expect to use a substantial portion of any gain recognized upon a closing of the transaction to invest in the Company’s growth initiatives.

TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE

Discount revenue increased $956 million or 5 percent in 2013 as compared to 2012, and $1,005 million or 6 percent in 2012 as compared to 2011. The 2013 increase reflects a 7 percent increase in worldwide billed business, which was partially offset by faster growth in GNS billings than overall Company billings, higher contra-revenue items, including cash rebate rewards, and a slight decline in the average discount rate. U.S. billed business and billed business outside the U.S. increased 8 percent and 6 percent, respectively, in 2013 as compared to the prior year, reflecting increases in average spending per proprietary basic card and basic cards-in-force. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates billed business outside the U.S. increased 10 percent. See Tables 5 and 6 for more detail on billed business performance. The 2012 increase in discount revenue as compared to 2011 reflects an 8 percent increase in worldwide billed business volumes, partially offset by a slight decline in the average discount rate and higher contra-revenue items, including cash rebate rewards and corporate client incentives. The average discount rate was 2.51 percent and 2.52 percent for 2013 and 2012, respectively. Over time, changes in the mix of spending by location and industry, volume-related pricing discounts, strategic investments, certain pricing initiatives and other factors will likely result in further erosion of the average discount rate.

Net card fees increased $125 million or 5 percent in 2013 as compared to 2012, and $58 million or 2 percent in 2012 as compared to 2011. The 2013 increase reflects higher average proprietary cards-in-force and higher average card fees in ICS and USCS. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, net card fees increased 8 percent in 2013 compared to 2012.2 The increase in 2012 as compared to 2011 reflects higher average proprietary cards-in-force.

 

2  	The foreign currency adjusted information, a non-GAAP measure, assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into U.S. dollars (i.e., assumes the foreign exchange rates used to determine results for the current year apply to the corresponding year period against which such results are being compared). The Company believes the presentation of information on a foreign currency adjusted basis is helpful to investors by making it easier to compare the Company’s performance in one period to that of another period without the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

2013 FINANCIAL REVIEW

 

Travel commissions and fees decreased $27 million or 1 percent in 2013 as compared to 2012, and $31 million or 2 percent in 2012 as compared to 2011. The decrease in 2013 reflects flat sales in business travel and a 2 percent decline in U.S. consumer travel sales. The decrease in 2012 as compared to 2011 reflects a 1 percent decline in worldwide travel sales. In 2012, business travel sales declined 4 percent, while U.S. consumer travel sales increased 12 percent.

Other commissions and fees increased $97 million or 4 percent in 2013 as compared to 2012, and $48 million or 2 percent in 2012 as compared to 2011. The 2013 increase was primarily due to lower Card Member reimbursements versus the prior year and marginally higher late fees and foreign currency conversion revenues, as well as higher revenue from the Company’s Loyalty Partner business. The increase in 2012 as compared to 2011 reflects higher revenues from the Loyalty Partner business.

Other revenues decreased $151 million or 6 percent in 2013 as compared to 2012, and increased $261 million or 12 percent in 2012 as compared to 2011. The 2013 decrease reflects the effect of a benefit in the first half of 2012 due to revised estimates of the liability for uncashed Travelers Cheques in certain international countries. The decrease also reflects the loss of revenue from the publishing business in the fourth quarter of 2013, and higher Card Member reimbursements within other revenue in 2013 as compared to 2012. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in Loyalty Edge revenue from additional client signings and a larger gain on the sale of investment securities in 2013. The increase in 2012 as compared to 2011 reflects higher gains on the sale of investment securities, higher GNS partner royalty revenues, and the previously mentioned favorable effects of revised estimates in the liability for uncashed Travelers Cheques in international countries.

Interest income increased $151 million or 2 percent in 2013 as compared to 2012, and $158 million or 2 percent in 2012 as compared to 2011. The increase in both years reflects an increase in interest on loans driven by higher average Card Member loans, partially offset by decreases in interest and dividends on investment securities driven by lower average investment securities.

Interest expense decreased $268 million or 12 percent in 2013 as compared to 2012, and $94 million or 4 percent in 2012 as compared to 2011. The decrease in both years was due to lower interest on deposits, reflecting a lower cost of funds, partially offset by increases in average customer deposit balances. The decreases also reflect lower interest on long-term debt and other, lower average long-term debt balances and, in 2013, a lower cost of funds on long-term debt.

PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES

Charge card provision for losses increased $47 million or 6 percent in 2013 as compared to 2012, and decreased $28 million or 4 percent in 2012 as compared to 2011. The 2013 increase reflects higher average Card Member receivable balances resulting in higher amounts of net write-offs, partially offset by a higher reserve release in 2013 than 2012. The 2012 decrease reflects a net reserve release in 2012 compared to a reserve build in 2011. Card Member loans provision for losses increased $80 million or 7 percent in 2013 as compared to 2012, and $896 million or over 100 percent in 2012 as compared to 2011. The 2013 increase reflects lower reserve releases as compared to the prior year, partially offset by the benefit of lower net write-offs in 2013 due to improved credit performance. The 2012 increase from 2011 reflects a smaller reserve release in 2012 than in 2011. Other provision for losses decreased $7 million or 7 percent in 2013 as compared to 2012, and increased $10 million or 11 percent in 2012 as compared to 2011.

EXPENSES

Marketing and promotion expenses increased $153 million or 5 percent in 2013 as compared to 2012, and decreased $106 million or 4 percent in 2012 as compared to 2011. The 2013 increase reflects higher spend on Card Member acquisition marketing. The 2012 decrease reflects lower loyalty and brand advertising.

Card Member rewards expenses increased $175 million or 3 percent in 2013 as compared to 2012, and $64 million or 1 percent in 2012 as compared to 2011. The 2013 increase reflects higher co-brand rewards expenses of $283 million, primarily relating to higher spending volumes, partially offset by a decrease in Membership Rewards expenses of $108 million. The 2013 decrease in Membership Rewards expenses resulted primarily from:

 

•	 	
a $208 million decrease related to the liability for Membership Rewards points earned by Card Members but not redeemed. This decrease includes the impact of a $342 million prior year expense relating to enhancements made to the U.S. URR estimation process which was partially offset by a net increase in expenses related to slower average declines in the WAC per point assumption and slower average growth in the URR as compared to the prior year, and

 

•	 	
a $100 million increase relating to higher new points earned. The increase for new points earned in 2013 was lower than the 2012 increase, primarily as a result of a decline in WAC per point during 2013, in relation to 2012.

The 2012 increase reflects higher co-brand rewards expenses of $148 million, primarily relating to higher spending volumes, partially offset by a decrease in Membership Rewards expenses of $84 million. The 2012 decrease in Membership Rewards expenses resulted primarily from:

 

•	 	
a $353 million decrease related to the liability for Membership Rewards points earned by Card Members but not yet redeemed. This decrease includes the aforementioned enhancements to the U.S. URR estimation process of $342 million recognized in 2012 which was more than offset by a $188 million expense relating to enhancements to the U.S. URR estimation process in 2011 and a net decrease in expenses related to slower average URR growth and favorable changes in the WAC per point assumption, and

 

•	 	
a $269 million increase relating to higher new points earned.

The Company’s Membership Rewards URR for current program participants was 94 percent (rounded down) at December 31, 2013, an increase from 94 percent (rounded up) at December 31, 2012 and 92 percent (rounded down) at December 31, 2011. The increases in the URR reflect greater engagement in the Company’s Membership Rewards program.

Card Member services expenses decreased $5 million or 1 percent in 2013 compared to 2012, and increased $56 million or 8 percent in 2012 as compared to 2011. The 2012 increase was driven by increases in the costs associated with enhanced benefits to U.S. Card Members.

Salaries and employee benefits expenses decreased $406 million or 6 percent in 2013 as compared to 2012, and increased $345 million or 6 percent in 2012 as compared to 2011. The change in both years was primarily driven by the restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 2012.

Other, net decreased $55 million or 1 percent in 2013 as compared to 2012, and increased $861 million or 15 percent in 2012 as compared to 2011. The 2013 decrease reflects higher Card Member reimbursements and investment impairments in the prior year. This decrease was partially offset by higher professional services expenses in the current year driven by increased investments in technology development and other investments in the business, as well as higher occupancy and equipment expenses, primarily reflecting higher data processing expenses as well as the fourth quarter proposed merchant litigation settlement. The 2012 increase reflects the absence of the benefits of the Visa and MasterCard litigation settlement payments that ceased in the fourth quarter 2011. In addition, the increase includes higher costs associated with Card Member reimbursements of $143 million in 2012, as well as impairments of certain cost method investments.

INCOME TAXES

The effective tax rate on continuing operations was 32.1 percent in 2013 compared to 30.5 percent in 2012 and 29.6 percent in 2011. The tax rate for 2013 included benefits of $150 million related to the resolution of certain prior years’ items. The tax rates for 2012 and 2011 included benefits of $146 million and $77 million, respectively, related to the realization of certain foreign tax credits. The tax rate for 2011 also included a benefit of $102 million related to the resolution of certain prior years’ tax items.

The tax rates in all years reflect the level of pretax income in relation to recurring permanent tax benefits and variances in the geographic mix of business.

(a)	Average basic Card Member spending and average fee per card are computed from proprietary card activities only. Average fee per card is computed based on net card fees, including the amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs divided by average worldwide proprietary cards-in-force. The adjusted average fee per card, which is a non-GAAP measure, is computed in the same manner, but excludes amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs. The amount of amortization excluded was $262 million, $257 million and $219 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The Company presents adjusted average fee per card because the Company believes this metric presents a useful indicator of card fee pricing across a range of its proprietary card products.

(a)	The foreign currency adjusted information assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into U.S. dollars (i.e., assumes the foreign exchange rates used to determine results for the current year apply to the corresponding year-earlier period against which such results are being compared). The Company believes the presentation of information on a foreign currency adjusted basis is helpful to investors by making it easier to compare the Company’s performance in one period to that of another period without the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
(b)	Captions in the table above not designated as “proprietary” or “GNS” include both proprietary and GNS data.
(c)	Included in the GNMS segment.
(d)	Included in the USCS segment.

(b)	Provisions for unauthorized transactions.
(c)	Net write-offs, less recoveries.
(d)	For Card Member receivables, includes net write-offs resulting from unauthorized transactions of $(160) million, $(141) million and $(161) million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively; foreign currency translation adjustments of $(4) million, $2 million and $(2) million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively; a reclassification of Card Member bankruptcy reserves of $18 million from other liabilities to credit reserves in 2012; and other items of $2 million, $9 million and $5 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. For Card Member loans, includes net write-offs for unauthorized transactions of $(130) million, $(116) million and $(103) million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively; foreign currency translation adjustments of $(12) million, $7 million and $(2) million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively; a reclassification of Card Member bankruptcy reserves of $4 million from other liabilities to credit reserves in 2012; and other items of $(6) million, $(10) million and $1 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
(e)	The Company presents a net write-off rate based on principal losses only (i.e., excluding interest and/or fees) to be consistent with industry convention. In addition, because the Company’s practice is to include uncollectible interest and/or fees as part of its total provision for losses, a net write-off rate including principal, interest and/or fees is also presented.
(f)	Refer to the following table for the calculation of net interest yield on Card Member loans, a non-GAAP measure, net interest income divided by average loans, a GAAP measure, and the Company’s rationale for presenting net interest yield on Card Member loans.

(a)	Adjusted average loans, adjusted net interest income and net interest yield on Card Member loans are non-GAAP measures. The Company believes adjusted net interest income and adjusted average loans are useful to investors because they are components of net interest yield on Card Member loans, which provides a measure of profitability of the Company’s Card Member loan portfolio.
BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS OVERVIEW

The Company considers a combination of factors when evaluating the composition of its reportable operating segments, including the results reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, economic characteristics, products and services offered, classes of customers, product distribution channels, geographic considerations (primarily U.S. versus non-U.S.) and regulatory environment considerations. Refer to Note 25 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of the products and services by segment.

Results of the business segments essentially treat each segment as a stand-alone business. The management reporting process that derives these results allocates revenue and expense using various methodologies as described below.

Refer to the “Glossary of Selected Terminology” for the definitions of certain key terms and related information appearing in this section.

TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE

The Company allocates discount revenue and certain other revenues among segments using a transfer pricing methodology. Within the USCS, ICS and GCS segments, discount revenue reflects the issuer component of the overall discount revenue generated by each segment’s Card Members; within the GNMS segment, discount revenue reflects the network and acquirer component of the overall discount revenue. Net card fees and travel commissions and fees are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported.

Interest and fees on loans and certain investment income is directly attributable to the segment in which it is reported. Interest expense reflects an allocated funding cost based on a combination of segment funding requirements and internal funding rates.

PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES

The provisions for losses are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported.

EXPENSES

Marketing and promotion expenses are reflected in each segment based on actual expenses incurred, with the exception of brand advertising, which is primarily reflected in the GNMS and USCS segments. Rewards and Card Member services expenses are reflected in each segment based on actual expenses incurred within each segment.

Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses reflect expenses such as professional services, occupancy and equipment and communications incurred directly within each segment. In addition, expenses related to the Company’s support services, such as technology costs, are allocated to each segment primarily based on support service activities directly attributable to the segment. Other overhead expenses, such as staff group support functions, are allocated from Corporate & Other to the other segments based on a mix of each segment’s direct consumption of services and relative level of pretax income.

CAPITAL

Each business segment is allocated capital based on established business model operating requirements, risk measures and regulatory capital requirements. Business model operating requirements include capital needed to support operations and specific balance sheet items. The risk measures include considerations for credit, market and operational risk.

INCOME TAXES

An income tax provision (benefit) is allocated to each business segment based on the effective tax rates applicable to various businesses that comprise the segment.

USCS issues a wide range of card products and services to consumers and small businesses in the U.S., and provides consumer travel services to Card Members and other consumers.

TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE

Discount revenue, net card fees and other revenues increased $654 million or 6 percent in 2013 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher discount revenue, resulting from billed business growth, and higher net card fees, partially offset by higher Card Member reimbursements within other revenue. Billed business increased 8 percent in 2013 as compared to the prior year, primarily driven by a 5 percent increase in average spending per proprietary basic card and 4 percent higher cards-in-force.

Interest income increased $223 million or 4 percent in 2013 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a 4 percent increase in average Card Member loans and higher net interest yield on Card Member loans as compared to the prior year.

Interest expense decreased $72 million or 9 percent in 2013 as compared to the prior year, due to a lower cost of funds, partially offset by higher average Card Member receivable and loan balances.

Total revenues net of interest expense increased $975 million or 6 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, primarily driven by higher discount revenue, increased net interest income, higher other revenues and higher net card fees.

PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES

Provisions for losses decreased $12 million or 1 percent in 2013 as compared to the prior year.

Provisions for losses increased $742 million or over 100 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting a smaller reserve release in 2012 than in 2011, partially offset by lower net write-offs in 2012.

Refer to Table 10 for the lending and charge card write-off rates for 2013, 2012 and 2011.

EXPENSES

Marketing, promotion, rewards and Card Member services expenses increased $273 million or 4 percent in 2013 as compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting higher marketing and promotion expenses and higher Card Member rewards in 2013. Card Member rewards expenses increased $78 million or 2 percent in 2013 as compared to 2012. The increase reflects higher co-brand rewards expenses of $265 million, primarily related to higher spending volumes, partially offset by a decrease in Membership Rewards expenses of $187 million. The 2013 decrease in Membership Rewards expenses resulted primarily from an increase in expenses relating to higher new points earned which was more than offset by a decrease in expenses related to the liability for Membership Rewards points earned by Card Members but not redeemed. This decrease includes the impact of a $317 million prior year expense relating to enhancements made to the U.S. URR estimation process which was partially offset by a net increase in expenses related to slower average declines in the WAC per point assumption and slower average growth in the URR as compared to the prior year.

Marketing, promotion, rewards and Card Member services expenses decreased $41 million or 1 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, due to lower marketing, promotion and rewards expenses, partially offset by higher Card Member services expenses. Card Member rewards expenses decreased $33 million or 1 percent in 2012 as compared to 2011. The decrease reflects higher co-brand rewards expenses of $75 million, primarily relating to higher spending volumes, which was more than offset by a decrease in Membership Rewards expenses of $108 million. The 2012 decrease in Membership Rewards expenses resulted primarily from an increase in expenses relating to higher new points earned which was more than offset by a decrease in expenses related to the liability for Membership Rewards points earned by Card Members but not yet redeemed. This decrease includes the aforementioned enhancements to the U.S. URR estimation process of $317 million recognized in 2012 which was more than offset by a $188 million expense relating to enhancements to the U.S. URR estimation process in 2011 and a decrease in expenses related to slower average URR growth and favorable changes in the WAC per point assumption.

2013 FINANCIAL REVIEW

 

Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses decreased $237 million or 6 percent in 2013 as compared to the prior year, reflecting lower Card Member reimbursement costs, as compared to the prior year. The 2013 decrease also reflects the restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 2012. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses increased $334 million or 9 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, primarily driven by higher other operating expenses related to Card Member reimbursement costs, an increase in expenses related to higher costs associated with hedging the Company’s fixed rate debt exposures and higher restructuring charges.

INCOME TAXES

The tax rate in all periods reflects the benefits from the resolution of certain prior years’ tax items and the relationship of recurring permanent tax benefits to varying levels of pretax income.

(a)	Return on average segment capital is calculated by dividing (i) one-year period segment income ($3.2 billion, $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively) by (ii) one-year average segment capital ($9.0 billion for both 2013 and 2012 and $8.1 billion for 2011). Return on average tangible segment capital, a non-GAAP measure, is computed in the same manner as return on average segment capital except the computation of average tangible segment capital, a non-GAAP measure, excludes from average segment capital average goodwill and other intangibles of $334 million, $379 million and $425 million as of December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The Company believes return on average tangible segment capital is a useful measure of the profitability of its business.
(b)	Refer to Table 7 footnote (e) on page 24.
(c)	Adjusted net interest income, adjusted average loans and net interest yield on Card Member loans are non-GAAP measures. Refer to “Glossary of Selected Terminology” for the definitions of these terms. The Company believes adjusted net interest income and adjusted average loans are useful to investors because they are components of net interest yield on Card Member loans, which provides a measure of profitability of the Company’s Card Member loan portfolio.

TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE

Discount revenue, net card fees and other revenues increased $83 million or 2 percent in 2013 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in net card fees, as well as higher Loyalty Partner commissions and fees and foreign exchange conversion fee revenue. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, discount revenue, net card fees and other revenues increased 6 percent in 2013 as compared to the prior year.3

Billed business increased 2 percent in 2013 as compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting an increase in average spending per proprietary basic card. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, billed business increased 6 percent in 2013 as compared to the prior year. Refer to Table 6 for additional information on billed business by region.

Interest income decreased $29 million or 3 percent in 2013 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower average Card Member loans as well as charges related to Card Member reimbursements in 2013. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, interest income increased 1 percent in 2013 as compared to the prior year.3

Interest expense decreased $41 million or 10 percent in 2013 as compared to the prior year, reflecting a lower cost of funds. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, interest expense decreased 6 percent in 2013 as compared to the prior year.3

Total revenues net of interest expense increased $67 million or 1 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher discount revenue, net card fees and other revenues, partially offset by lower net interest income.

PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES

Provisions for losses increased $114 million or 35 percent in 2013 as compared to the prior year, primarily driven by a higher provision for both charge cards and Card Member loans. The increase in charge card provision reflects higher average receivables resulting in higher net write-offs and a reserve build in 2013. The increase in Card Member loans provision reflects a lower reserve release compared to the prior year, partially offset by lower net write-offs. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, provisions for losses increased 38 percent in 2013 as compared to the prior year.3

Provisions for losses increased $62 million or 23 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, primarily driven by higher Card Member loans provision due to lower reserve releases in 2012, partially offset by lower charge card provision and lower Card Member lending net write-off rates.

Refer to Table 12 for the lending and charge write-off rates for 2013, 2012 and 2011.

EXPENSES

Marketing, promotion, rewards and Card Member services expenses increased $86 million or 4 percent in 2013 as compared to the prior year, driven primarily by higher Card Member rewards expenses, which includes a charge related to a change in the International Membership Rewards URR estimation process for certain international countries, as well as higher marketing and promotion expenses. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, marketing, promotion, rewards and Card Member services expenses increased 8 percent in 2013 as compared to the prior year.3 Marketing, promotion, rewards and Card Member services expenses increased $70 million or 4 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, driven by higher volume-related rewards costs and co-brand expenses and higher Card Member services expenses, partially offset by lower marketing and promotion expenses.

Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses decreased $89 million or 4 percent in 2013 as compared to the prior year, primarily driven by lower salaries and employee benefits, as well as lower other operating expenses reflecting the restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 2012. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses decreased 1 percent in 2013 as compared to the prior year.4 Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses increased $38 million or 2 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher restructuring charges, partially offset by lower other operating expenses.

INCOME TAXES

The effective tax rate in all periods reflects the recurring permanent tax benefit related to the segment’s ongoing funding activities outside the U.S., which is allocated to ICS under the Company’s internal tax allocation process. The effective tax rate for 2013 also reflects the allocated share of tax benefits related to the resolution of certain prior years’ items and the effective tax rate for 2012 and 2011 reflects the allocated share of tax benefits related to the realization of certain foreign tax credits. In addition, the effective tax rate in each of the periods reflects the impact of recurring permanent tax benefits on varying levels of pretax income.

 *	Proprietary cards only.
(a)	Return on average segment capital is calculated by dividing (i) one-year period segment income ($631 million, $634 million and $723 million for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively) by (ii) one-year average segment capital ($3.0 billion, $2.9 billion and $2.8 billion for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively). Return on average tangible segment capital, a non-GAAP measure, is computed in the same manner as return on average segment capital except the computation of average tangible segment capital, a non-GAAP measure, excludes from average segment capital average goodwill and other intangibles of $1.4 billion at both December 31, 2013 and 2012 and $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2011. The Company believes return on average tangible segment capital is a useful measure of the profitability of its business.
(b)	Refer to Table 7 footnote (e) on page 24.
(c)	Adjusted net interest income, adjusted average loans and net interest yield on Card Member loans are non-GAAP measures. The Company believes adjusted net interest income and adjusted average loans are useful to investors because they are components of net interest yield on Card Member loans, which provides a measure of profitability of the Company’s Card Member loan portfolio.

TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE

Discount revenue, net card fees, and other revenues increased $90 million or 2 percent in 2013 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher discount revenue resulting from an increased level of Card Member spending and higher other commissions and fees. Billed business increased 5 percent in 2013 as compared to the prior year, primarily driven by a 5 percent increase in average spending per proprietary basic card. Billed business volume increased 8 percent within the U.S. and 2 percent outside the U.S.

Net interest expense decreased $14 million or 6 percent in 2013 as compared to the prior year, primarily driven by a lower cost of funds, partially offset by increased funding requirements due to higher average Card Member receivable balances. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, net interest expense decreased 3 percent for 2013 as compared to the prior year.5

Total revenues net of interest expense increased $124 million or 3 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher discount revenue, net card fees, and other revenues.

PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES

Provisions for losses increased $23 million or 17 percent in 2013 as compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting higher average Card Member receivables resulting in higher net write-offs, partially offset by a lower reserve build compared to the prior year. Provisions for losses increased $60 million or 79 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, reflecting a change in estimate for certain credit reserves that resulted in higher reserve releases in 2011. Refer to Table 14 for the charge card net loss ratio as a percentage of charge volume.

EXPENSES

Marketing, promotion, rewards and Card Member services expenses increased $25 million or 4 percent in 2013 as compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting higher rewards costs related to higher volumes and an enhancement in the International Membership Rewards URR estimation process. Marketing, promotion, rewards and Card Member services expenses increased $32 million or 6 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a $25 million charge related to a change in the U.S. Membership Rewards URR estimation process.

Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses decreased $228 million or 7 percent in 2013 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher restructuring costs in 2012, as well as lower payroll and benefit costs in 2013. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses increased $147 million or 5 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, primarily driven by higher restructuring charges and other operating expenses.

INCOME TAXES

The effective tax rate for 2013 reflects the reversal of a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets associated with certain of the Company’s non-U.S. business travel operations, as well as the allocated share of tax benefits related to the resolution of certain prior years’ tax items. Based on management’s intent to reorganize its business travel operations through the creation of a joint venture, it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be sufficient to support the realization of the benefit of the associated non-US deferred tax assets.

The effective tax rate for 2012 and 2011 reflects the allocated share of tax benefits related to the realization of certain foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate for 2012 also reflects the impact of a valuation allowance primarily related to restructuring charges associated with certain non-U.S. travel operations.

Return on average tangible segment capital, a non-GAAP measure, is computed in the same manner as return on average segment capital except the computation of average tangible segment capital, a non-GAAP measure, excludes from average segment capital average goodwill and other intangibles of $1.8 billion at both December 31, 2013 and 2012 and $1.9 billion at December 31, 2011. The Company believes return on average tangible segment capital is a useful measure of the profitability of its business.

GNMS operates a global payments network which processes and settles proprietary and non-proprietary card transactions. GNMS acquires merchants and provides point-of-sale products, multi-channel marketing programs and capabilities, services and data, leveraging the Company’s global closed-loop network. It provides ATM services and enters into partnership agreements with third-party card issuers and acquirers, licensing the American Express brand and extending the reach of the global network.

TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE

Discount revenue, net card fees and other revenues increased $224 million or 4 percent in 2013 as compared to the prior year. The increase primarily reflects higher merchant-related revenues, driven by a 7 percent increase in global card billed business, as well as higher GNS revenues.

The interest expense credit increased $9 million or 4 percent in 2013 as compared to the prior year, reflecting the Company’s internal transfer pricing and funding rates, which results in a net benefit for GNMS due to its merchant payables.

Total revenues net of interest expense increased $329 million or 7 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher discount revenue, net card fees and other revenues and higher net interest income.

PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES

Provisions for losses decreased $5 million or 7 percent in 2013 as compared to the prior year. Provisions for losses decreased $1 million or 1 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year.

EXPENSES

Marketing, promotion, rewards and Card Member services expenses decreased $40 million or 5 percent in 2013 as compared to 2012 and $11 million or 1 percent in 2012 compared to 2011. The decrease in both years reflects lower marketing and promotion expenses.

Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses increased $37 million or 2 percent in 2013 as compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting increased other operating expenses related to the proposed merchant litigation settlement, partially offset by decreases in professional services and salary and employee benefits. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses increased $101 million or 5 percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher professional services costs and increases in salary and employee benefits costs, partially offset by other operating expenses.

Return on average tangible segment capital, a non-GAAP measure, is computed in the same manner as return on average segment capital except the computation of average tangible segment capital, a non-GAAP measure, excludes from average segment capital average goodwill and other intangibles of $195 million, $203 million and $209 million as of December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The Company believes return on average tangible segment capital is a useful measure of the profitability of its business.
 

CORPORATE & OTHER

Corporate functions and auxiliary businesses, including the Company’s EGG (including Global Payment Options) and other Company operations, are included in Corporate & Other.

Corporate & Other had net after-tax expense of $900 million, $831 million and $535 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The increase in net after-tax expense for 2013 was primarily a result of favorable effects in 2012 of revised estimates of the liability for uncashed Travelers Cheques in certain international countries, as well as higher tax expenses in the current year. The 2013 increase was partially offset by the impact of restructuring costs in 2012.

The increase in net after-tax expense in 2012 was primarily a result of the loss of after-tax income related to the MasterCard and Visa settlements of $186 million and $172 million, respectively which ended in the fourth quarter of 2011, as well as an increase in restructuring costs. The 2012 increase was partially offset by higher gains on sales of investment securities and the aforementioned favorable effects of revised estimates of the liability for uncashed international Travelers Cheques.

Results for all periods disclosed also included net interest expense related to maintaining the liquidity pool discussed in “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity — Liquidity Management”, as well as interest expense related to other corporate indebtedness.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY

2013 FINANCIAL REVIEW

 

CONSOLIDATED CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

The Company’s balance sheet management objectives are to maintain:

 

•	 	
A solid and flexible equity capital profile;

 

•	 	
A broad, deep and diverse set of funding sources to finance its assets and meet operating requirements; and

 

•	 	
Liquidity programs that enable the Company to continuously meet expected future financing obligations and business requirements for at least a 12-month period, even in the event it is unable to continue to raise new funds under its traditional funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions.

CAPITAL STRATEGY

The Company’s objective is to retain sufficient levels of capital generated through earnings and other sources to maintain a solid equity capital base and to provide flexibility to support future business growth. The Company believes capital allocated to growing businesses with a return on risk-adjusted equity in excess of its costs will generate shareholder value.

The level and composition of the Company’s consolidated capital position are determined through the Company’s internal capital adequacy assessment process, which reflects its business activities, as well as marketplace conditions and requirements or expectations of credit rating agencies, regulators and shareholders, among others. The Company’s consolidated capital position is also influenced by subsidiary capital requirements. The Company, as a bank holding company, is also subject to regulatory requirements administered by the U.S. federal banking agencies. The Federal Reserve has established specific capital adequacy guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items.

The Company currently calculates and reports its capital ratios under the standards commonly referred to as Basel I. The Company has adopted Basel III in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions and is currently taking steps toward Basel III advanced approaches implementation in the U.S. As an advanced approaches institution, the Company will report its 2014 capital ratios using Basel III capital definitions and Basel I risk-weighted assets. Beginning in 2015, the Company will report its capital ratios under the Basel III standardized approach to risk-weighted assets.

During 2014, the Company will begin reporting its capital adequacy standards on a parallel basis to its regulators under Basel requirements for an advanced approaches institution. The parallel period will continue until the Company receives regulatory approval to exit parallel reporting and subsequently begin publicly reporting its capital ratios using both Basel III standardized and advanced approaches.

The following table presents the regulatory risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios for the Company and its significant bank subsidiaries, as well as additional ratios widely utilized in the marketplace, as of December 31, 2013.

The following provides definitions for the Company’s regulatory risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratio, which are calculated as per standard regulatory guidance, if applicable:

Risk-Weighted Assets — Assets are weighted for risk according to a formula used by the Federal Reserve to conform to capital adequacy guidelines. On- and off-balance sheet items are weighted for risk, with off-balance sheet items converted to balance sheet equivalents, using risk conversion factors, before being allocated a risk-adjusted weight. The off-balance sheet items comprise a minimal part of the overall calculation. Risk-weighted assets under Basel I as of December 31, 2013 were $129.5 billion.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY

2013 FINANCIAL REVIEW

 

Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio — The Tier 1 capital ratio is calculated as Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 capital is the sum of common shareholders’ equity, certain perpetual preferred stock (not applicable to the Company), and non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries, adjusted for ineligible goodwill and intangible assets, as well as certain other comprehensive income items as follows: net unrealized gains/losses on securities and derivatives, and net unrealized pension and other postretirement benefit losses, all net of tax. Tier 1 capital as of December 31, 2013 was $16.2 billion. This ratio is commonly used by regulatory agencies to assess a financial institution’s financial strength. Tier 1 capital is the primary form of capital used to absorb losses beyond current loss accrual estimates.

Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio — The total risk-based capital ratio is calculated as the sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 2 capital is the sum of the allowance for receivable and loan losses (limited to 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets) and 45 percent of the unrealized gains on equity securities, plus a $750 million subordinated hybrid security, for which the Company received approval from the Federal Reserve for treatment as Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital as of December 31, 2013 was $2.4 billion. The $750 million subordinated hybrid security is not expected to meet the requirements of Tier 2 capital under Basel III, and will begin to be transitioned out of capital beginning in 2014. See “Basel III” below.

Tier 1 Leverage Ratio — The Tier 1 leverage ratio is calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by the Company’s average total consolidated assets for the most recent quarter. Average total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2013 were $148.6 billion.

The following provides definitions for capital ratios widely used in the marketplace, although they may be calculated differently by different companies:

Tier 1 Common Risk-Based Capital Ratio — The Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio is calculated as Tier 1 common equity, a non-GAAP measure, divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 common equity is calculated by reference to total shareholders’ equity as shown below:

TABLE 18: TOTAL TIER 1 COMMON EQUITY

 

(Billions)	  	December 31,
2013	 
 

  	
 

 

 
Total shareholders’ equity

  	$	19.5	 
Net effect of certain items in accumulated other comprehensive loss excluded from Tier 1 common equity

  	 	0.4	 
Less: Ineligible goodwill and intangible assets

  	 	(3.5	) 
Less: Ineligible deferred tax assets

  	 	(0.2	) 
 

  	
 

 

 
Total Tier 1 common equity

  	$	16.2	 
The Company believes the Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio is useful because it can be used to assess and compare the quality and composition of the Company’s capital with the capital of other financial services companies. Moreover, Basel III includes measures that rely on the Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio.

Common Equity and Tangible Common Equity to Risk-Weighted Assets Ratios — Common equity equals the Company’s shareholders’ equity of $19.5 billion as of December 31, 2013, and tangible common equity, a non-GAAP measure, equals common equity less goodwill and other intangibles of $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2013. The Company believes presenting the ratio of tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets is a useful measure of evaluating the strength of the Company’s capital position.

The Company seeks to maintain capital levels and ratios in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements and finance such capital in a cost efficient manner; failure to maintain minimum capital levels could affect the Company’s status as a financial holding company and cause the respective regulatory agencies to take actions that could limit the Company’s business operations.

The Company’s primary source of equity capital has been the generation of net income. Historically, capital generated through net income and other sources, such as the exercise of stock options by employees, has exceeded the annual growth in its capital requirements. To the extent capital has exceeded business, regulatory and rating agency requirements, the Company has historically returned excess capital to shareholders through its regular common share dividend and share repurchase program.

The Company maintains certain flexibility to shift capital across its businesses as appropriate. For example, the Company may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements. These infused amounts can affect the capital profile and liquidity levels at the American Express parent company level. The Company does not currently intend or foresee a need to shift capital from non-U.S. subsidiaries with permanently reinvested earnings to a U.S. parent company.

Basel III

Basel III, when fully phased-in, will require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital than prior requirements, with a greater emphasis on common equity. The Company estimates that had Basel III been fully phased-in during 2013, its reported Tier 1 risk-based capital and Tier 1 common risk-based ratios would have been 12.2 percent, and its reported Tier 1 leverage ratio would have been 10.7 percent. As of December 31, 2013, had the Basel III rules been effective, the Company’s supplementary leverage ratio would be 9.0 percent.6 These ratios are calculated using the standardized approach for determining risk-weighted assets. As noted

The capital ratios are non-GAAP measures. The Company believes the presentation of the capital ratios is helpful to investors by showing the impact of Basel III.

above, the Company is currently taking steps toward Basel III advanced approaches implementation in the U.S. The Company’s $750 million subordinated hybrid security, which is presently included in Tier 2 capital (but not in Tier 1 capital), is not expected to meet the requirements of Tier 2 capital under Basel III. The disqualification of this subordinated hybrid security from Tier 2 capital will affect our total risk-based capital ratio under Basel III; however, this ratio is expected to remain well in excess of the required minimum.

The following provides definitions for capital ratios as defined by Basel III using the standardized approach. All calculations are non-GAAP measures.

Basel III Tier 1 Common Risk-Based Capital Ratio — The Basel III Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio is calculated as adjusted Tier 1 common equity divided by adjusted risk-weighted assets.

Basel III Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio — The Basel III Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is calculated as adjusted Tier 1 capital divided by adjusted risk-weighted assets.

The following table presents a comparison of the Company’s Tier 1 and Tier 1 common risk-based capital under Basel I to its estimated Tier 1 and Tier 1 common risk-based capital under Basel III.

(b)	Estimated Basel III Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 common equity reflects the Company’s current interpretation of Basel III. The estimated Basel III Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 common equity could change if the Company’s business changes; and the estimated impact for 2013 is not necessarily indicative of the impact in future periods.
Basel III Risk-Weighted Assets — The Basel III risk-weighted assets reflect the Company’s Basel I risk-weighted assets, adjusted for the impact of the incremental risk weighting applied to deferred tax assets and significant investments in unconsolidated financial institutions, as well as exposures to past due accounts, equities and sovereigns. Basel III risk-weighted assets as of December 31, 2013 were estimated to be $130.5 billion.

Basel III Tier 1 Leverage Ratio — The Basel III Tier 1 leverage ratio is calculated by dividing Basel III Tier 1 capital by the Company’s average total consolidated assets.

Basel III Supplementary Leverage Ratio — The Basel III supplementary leverage ratio is calculated by dividing Basel III Tier 1 capital by the Company’s total assets for leverage capital purposes under Basel III. Total assets for leverage capital purposes includes adjustments for Tier 1 capital deductions, off-balance sheet derivatives, undrawn unconditionally cancellable commitments and other off-balance sheet liabilities. Total assets for leverage capital purposes as of December 31, 2013 were $176.3 billion.

SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS

The Company has a share repurchase program to return excess capital to shareholders. The share repurchases reduce shares outstanding and offset, in whole or part, the issuance of new shares as part of employee compensation plans.

During 2013, the Company returned approximately $5.0 billion to its shareholders in the form of dividends ($967 million) and share repurchases ($4.0 billion). The Company repurchased 55 million common shares at an average price of $72.51 in 2013. These dividend and share repurchase amounts represent approximately 81 percent of total capital generated during the year. This percentage for 2013 is significantly greater than the on average and over time target to distribute approximately 50 percent of the capital to shareholders as dividends or through the repurchases of common stock. These distribution percentages result from the strength of the Company’s capital ratios and the amount of capital it generates from net income and through employee stock plans in relation to the amount of capital required to support its organic business growth and through acquisitions.

On January 6, 2014, the Company submitted its comprehensive capital plan to the Federal Reserve. The capital plan includes an analysis of performance and capital availability under certain adverse economic assumptions. The capital plan was submitted to the Federal Reserve pursuant to its guidance on dividends and capital distributions. The Company expects a response from the Federal Reserve by March 31, 2014. In the first quarter of 2014, the Company is expected to execute share repurchases up to $1.0 billion pursuant to its capital plan that received no objections from the Federal Reserve in March 2013.

FUNDING STRATEGY

The Company’s principal funding objective is to maintain broad and well-diversified funding sources to allow it to meet its maturing obligations, cost-effectively finance current and future asset growth in its global businesses as well as to maintain a strong liquidity profile. The diversity of funding sources by type of debt instrument, by maturity and by investor base, among other factors, provides additional insulation from the impact of disruptions in any one type of debt, maturity or investor. The mix of the Company’s funding in any period will seek to achieve cost efficiency consistent with both maintaining diversified sources and achieving its liquidity objectives. The Company’s funding strategy and activities are integrated into its

asset-liability management activities. The Company has in place a funding policy covering American Express Company and all of its subsidiaries.

The Company’s proprietary card businesses are the primary asset-generating businesses, with significant assets in both domestic and international Card Member receivable and lending activities. The Company’s financing needs are in large part a consequence of its proprietary card-issuing businesses and the maintenance of a liquidity position to support all of its business activities, such as merchant payments. The Company generally pays merchants for card transactions prior to reimbursement by Card Members and therefore funds the merchant payments during the period Card Member loans and receivables are outstanding. The Company also has additional financing needs associated with general corporate purposes, including acquisition activities.

FUNDING PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES

The Company meets its funding needs through a variety of sources, including direct and third-party distributed deposits and debt instruments, such as senior unsecured debentures, asset securitizations, borrowings through secured borrowing facilities and long-term committed bank borrowing facilities in certain non-U.S. regions.

The Company had the following consolidated debt and customer deposits outstanding as of December 31:

The Company seeks to raise funds to meet all of its financing needs, including seasonal and other working capital needs, while also seeking to maintain sufficient cash and readily marketable securities that are easily convertible to cash, in order to meet the scheduled maturities of all long-term funding obligations on a consolidated basis for a 12-month period. Management does not currently expect to make any significant changes to the Company’s funding programs or liquidity strategy in order to satisfy Basel III’s liquidity coverage ratio standard based upon its current understanding of the requirements.

The Company’s funding plan for the full year 2014 includes, among other sources, approximately $6.0 billion to $12.0 billion of unsecured term debt issuance and $3.0 billion to $9.0 billion of secured term debt issuance. The Company’s funding plans are subject to various risks and uncertainties, such as future business growth, the impact of global economic, political and other events on market capacity, demand for securities offered by the Company, regulatory changes, ability to securitize and sell receivables, and the performance of receivables previously sold in securitization transactions. Many of these risks and uncertainties are beyond the Company’s control.

The Company’s equity capital and funding strategies are designed, among other things, to maintain appropriate and stable unsecured debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies: Moody’s Investor Services (Moody’s), Standard & Poor’s (S&P), Fitch Ratings (Fitch) and Dominion Bond Rating Services (DBRS). Such ratings help support the Company’s access to cost-effective unsecured funding as part of its overall funding strategy. The Company’s asset-backed securitization (ABS) activities are rated separately.

Downgrades in the ratings of the Company’s unsecured debt or asset securitization program securities could result in higher funding costs, as well as higher fees related to borrowings under its unused lines of credit. Declines in credit ratings could also reduce the Company’s borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets. The Company believes its funding mix, including the proportion of U.S. retail deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on the Company’s funding capacity and costs.

SHORT-TERM FUNDING PROGRAMS

Short-term borrowings, such as commercial paper, are defined as any debt with an original maturity of 12 months or less, as well as interest-bearing overdrafts with banks. The Company’s short-term funding programs are used primarily to meet working capital needs, such as managing seasonal variations in receivables balances. The amount of short-term borrowings issued in the future will depend on the Company’s funding strategy, its needs and market conditions.

As of December 31, 2013, the Company had $0.2 billion commercial paper outstanding. Average commercial paper outstanding was $0.1 billion and $0.4 billion in 2013 and 2012, respectively.

DEPOSIT PROGRAMS

The Company offers deposits within its American Express Centurion Bank (Centurion Bank) and American Express Bank, FSB (FSB) subsidiaries (together, the Banks). These funds are currently insured up to $250,000 per account holder through the FDIC. The Company’s ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates is dependent on the Banks’ capital levels. The Company, through the FSB, has a direct retail deposit program, Personal Savings from American Express, to supplement its distribution of deposit products sourced through third-party distribution channels. The direct retail program makes FDIC-insured certificates of deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings account products available directly to consumers.

The Company held the following deposits as of December 31:

(b)	Beginning 2013, the Company reclassified prospectively Card Member credit balances from Card Member loans, Card Member receivables and Other liabilities to Customer deposits.
LONG-TERM DEBT PROGRAMS

During 2013, the Company and its subsidiaries issued debt and asset securitizations with maturities ranging from 3 to 5 years. These amounts included approximately $3.3 billion of AAA-rated securitization certificates and notes, $0.2 billion of subordinated securities and $5.5 billion of unsecured debt across a variety of maturities and markets. During the year, the Company retained approximately $0.3 billion of subordinated securities, as the pricing and yields for these securities were not attractive compared to other sources of financing available to the Company.

The Company’s 2013 debt issuances were as follows:

(a)	Issuances from the Lending Trust and the American Express Issuance Trust II (Charge Trust II) do not include $0.3 billion of subordinated securities retained by the Company during the year.
ASSET SECURITIZATION PROGRAMS

The Company periodically securitizes Card Member receivables and loans arising from its card business, as the securitization market provides the Company with cost-effective funding. Securitization of Card Member receivables and loans is accomplished through the transfer of those assets to a trust, which in turn issues securities collateralized by the transferred assets to third-party investors. The proceeds from issuance are distributed to the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, as consideration for the transferred assets.

The receivables and loans being securitized are reported as assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and the related securities issued to third-party investors are reported as long-term debt.

Under the respective terms of the securitization trust agreements, the occurrence of certain triggering events associated with the performance of the assets of each trust could result in payment of trust expenses, establishment of reserve funds, or in a worst-case scenario, early amortization of investor certificates. During the year ended December 31, 2013, no such triggering events occurred.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY

2013 FINANCIAL REVIEW

 

During 2013, the Company transferred Card Member receivables from the American Express Issuance Trust (Charge Trust) to the Charge Trust II, dissolving the Charge Trust. The Company will continue to utilize the Charge Trust II for securitization of Card Member receivables.

LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT

The Company’s liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of cash, readily marketable securities and contingent sources of liquidity, so that the Company can continuously meet expected future financing obligations and business requirements for at least a 12-month period, even in the event it is unable to raise new funds under its regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions. The Company has in place a liquidity risk policy that sets out the Company’s approach to managing liquidity risk on an enterprise-wide basis.

The Company incurs and accepts liquidity risk arising in the normal course of offering its products and services. The liquidity risks that the Company is exposed to can arise from a variety of sources, and thus its liquidity management strategy includes a variety of parameters, assessments and guidelines, including, but not limited to:

 

•	 	
Maintaining a diversified set of funding sources (refer to Funding Strategy section for more details);

 

•	 	
Maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and off-balance sheet liquidity sources; and

 

•	 	
Projecting cash inflows and outflows from a variety of sources and under a variety of scenarios, including collateral requirements for derivative transactions.

The Company’s current liquidity target is to have adequate liquidity in the form of excess cash and readily marketable securities that are easily convertible into cash to satisfy all maturing long-term funding obligations for a 12-month period. In addition to its cash and readily marketable securities, the Company maintains a variety of contingent liquidity resources, such as access to undrawn amounts under its secured borrowing facilities, committed bank credit facilities and the Federal Reserve discount window.

As of December 31, 2013, the Company had $13.0 billion in excess cash available to fund long-term maturities:

The draw on the Charge Trust II facility was repaid on January 15, 2014 and the draw on the Lending Trust facility was repaid on February 18, 2014.
The Company’s financing needs for the next 12 months are expected to arise from these debt and deposit maturities as well as changes in business needs, including changes in outstanding Card Member loans and receivables and acquisition activities.

The Company considers various factors in determining the amount of liquidity it maintains, such as economic and financial market conditions, seasonality in business operations, growth in its businesses, potential acquisitions or dispositions, the cost and availability of alternative liquidity sources, and regulatory and credit rating agency considerations.

The yield the Company receives on its cash and readily marketable securities is, generally, less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances. Thus, the Company incurs substantial net interest costs on these amounts. The level of net interest costs will be dependent on the size of the Company’s cash and readily marketable securities holdings, as well as the difference between its cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields.

Securitized Borrowing Capacity

As of December 31, 2013, the Company maintained its committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility, with a maturity date of September 15, 2015, that gives the Company the right to sell up to $2.0 billion face amount of eligible AAA certificates from the Lending Trust. On July 18, 2013, the Company terminated its existing $3.0 billion Charge Trust II committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility with a maturity date of July 15, 2014 and entered into a new three-year committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility with a maturity date of July 15, 2016 that gives the Company the right to sell up to $3.0 billion face amount of eligible AAA notes from the Charge Trust II. Both facilities are used in the ordinary course of business to fund seasonal working capital needs, as well as to further enhance the Company’s contingent funding resources. As of December 31, 2013, $3.0 billion and $2.0 billion were drawn on the Charge Trust II facility and Lending Trust facility, respectively.

Federal Reserve Discount Window

As insured depository institutions, the Banks may borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, subject to the amount of qualifying collateral that they may pledge. The Federal Reserve has indicated that both credit and charge card receivables are a form of qualifying collateral for secured borrowings made through the discount window. Whether specific assets will be considered qualifying collateral and the amount that may be borrowed against the collateral remain at the discretion of the Federal Reserve.

The Company had approximately $48.5 billion as of December 31, 2013 in U.S. credit card loans and charge card receivables that could be sold over time through its existing securitization trusts, or pledged in return for secured borrowings to provide further liquidity, subject in each case to applicable market conditions and eligibility criteria.

Committed Bank Credit Facilities

In addition to the secured borrowing facilities described above, the Company maintained committed syndicated bank credit facilities as of December 31, 2013 of $7.0 billion, which expire as follows:

Total

  	$	7.0	 
The availability of the credit lines is subject to the Company’s compliance with certain financial covenants, principally the maintenance by Credco of a certain ratio of combined earnings and fixed charges to fixed charges. As of December 31, 2013, the Company was in compliance with each of its covenants. The drawn balance of the committed credit facilities of $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2013 was used to fund the Company’s business activities in the normal course. The remaining capacity of the facilities mainly served to further enhance the Company’s contingent funding resources.

The Company’s committed bank credit facilities do not contain material adverse change clauses, which might otherwise preclude borrowing under the credit facilities, nor are they dependent on the Company’s credit rating.

CASH FLOWS

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

Cash flows from operating activities primarily include net income adjusted for (i) non-cash items included in net income, including provisions for losses, depreciation and amortization, deferred taxes, and stock-based compensation and (ii) changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities, which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of various payments.

For the year ended December 31, 2013, net cash provided by operating activities of $8.5 billion increased $1.4 billion compared to $7.1 billion in 2012, primarily due to higher net income, premium paid on debt exchange in 2012 and smaller changes in accounts payable and other liabilities, partially offset by a decrease in deferred taxes and other.

For the year ended December 31, 2012, net cash provided by operating activities of $7.1 billion decreased $2.7 billion compared to $9.8 billion in 2011. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the liabilities for accounts payable and other liabilities in 2012 as compared to the prior year versus an increase in 2011 as compared to the prior year.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

The Company’s investing activities primarily include funding Card Member loans and receivables and the Company’s available-for-sale investment portfolio.

For the year ended December 31, 2013, net cash used in investing activities of $7.3 billion increased $0.8 billion compared to $6.5 billion in 2012, primarily due to higher purchases of investments.

For the year ended December 31, 2012, net cash used in investing activities of $6.5 billion increased $6.0 billion compared to $0.5 billion in 2011, primarily due to a reduction in maturities, redemptions and sales of investments, and a net decrease in the cash flows related to Card Member loans and receivables and restricted cash, partially offset by lower purchases of investments and fewer acquisitions in 2012 as compared to 2011.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

The Company’s financing activities primarily include issuing and repaying debt, taking customer deposits, issuing and repurchasing its common shares, and paying dividends.

For the year ended December 31, 2013, net cash used in financing activities of $3.9 billion increased $0.6 billion compared to $3.3 billion in 2012, due to lower issuances of long-term debt, slowing growth in customer deposits and higher principal payments on long-term debt, partially offset by an increase in short-term borrowings and the issuance of American Express common shares to employees.

For the year ended December 31, 2012, net cash used in financing activities of $3.3 billion increased $2.6 billion compared to $0.7 billion in 2011, due to a decrease in short-term borrowings, and an increase in the repurchase of common shares in 2012, which more than offset a decrease in principal payments on long-term debt.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

The Company has identified both on and off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations and other relationships that may have a material current or future effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity and capital resources.

(a)	The above table excludes approximately $1.0 billion of tax liabilities that have been recorded in accordance with GAAP governing the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes as inherent complexities and the number of tax years currently open for examination in multiple jurisdictions do not permit reasonable estimates of payments, if any, to be made over a range of years.
(b)	Estimated interest payments were calculated using the effective interest rate in place as of December 31, 2013, and reflects the effect of existing interest rate swaps. Actual cash flows may differ from estimated payments.
(c)	As of December 31, 2013, there were no minimum required contributions, and no contributions are currently planned, for the U.S. American Express Retirement Plan. For the U.S. American Express Retirement Restoration Plan and non-U.S. defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans, contributions in 2014 are anticipated to be approximately $61 million, and this amount has been included within other long-term liabilities. Remaining obligations under defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans aggregating $600 million have not been included in the table above as the timing of such obligations is not determinable. Additionally, other long-term liabilities do not include $6.2 billion of Membership Rewards liabilities, which are not considered long-term liabilities as Card Members in good standing can redeem points immediately, without restrictions, and because the timing of point redemption is not determinable.
(d)	The purchase obligation amounts represent non-cancelable minimum contractual obligations by period under contracts that were in effect as of December 31, 2013. Termination fees are included in these amounts.
 

The Company also has certain contingent obligations to make payments under contractual agreements entered into as part of the ongoing operation of the Company’s business, primarily with co-brand partners. The contingent obligations under such arrangements were approximately $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2013.

In addition to the contractual obligations noted above, the Company has off-balance sheet arrangements that include guarantees and other off-balance sheet arrangements as more fully described below.

GUARANTEES

The Company’s principal guarantees are associated with Card Member services to enhance the value of owning an American Express card. As of December 31, 2013, the Company had guarantees totaling approximately $45 billion related to Card Member protection plans, as well as other guarantees in the ordinary course of business that are within the scope of GAAP governing the accounting for guarantees. Refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding the Company’s guarantees.

CERTAIN OTHER OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

As of December 31, 2013, the Company had approximately $265 billion of unused credit available to Card Members as part of established lending product agreements. Total unused credit available to Card Members does not represent potential future cash requirements, as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn. The Company’s charge card products generally have no pre-set limit, and therefore are not reflected in unused credit available to Card Members.

To mitigate counterparty credit risk related to derivatives, the Company accepted noncash collateral in the form of security interest in U.S. Treasury securities from its derivatives counterparties with a fair value of nil and $335 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, none of which was sold or repledged.

Refer to Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion regarding the Company’s other off-balance sheet arrangements.

RISK MANAGEMENT

GOVERNANCE

The Company uses its comprehensive Enterprise-wide Risk Management (ERM) program to measure, aggregate, monitor, and manage risks. The ERM program is designed to enable the Board of Directors and management to assess the effectiveness of risk management capabilities, policies, processes and controls. It also contributes to the risk-adjusted performance evaluation of the Company’s businesses and business leaders. The implementation and execution of the ERM program is headed by the Company’s Chief Risk Officer.

Risk management and key risks identified by management are overseen by the Company’s Board of Directors and three of its committees: the Risk Committee, the Audit and Compliance Committee, and the Compensation and Benefits Committee. Each of these committees consists entirely of independent directors and provides regular reports to the Board of Directors regarding matters reviewed at the committee level. In addition to the risks under the purview of a particular committee, the Board of Directors monitors the “tone at the top” and risk culture of the Company, oversees strategic risk, and reviews specific and significant risks facing the Company from time to time. These Committees meet regularly in private sessions with the Company’s Chief Risk Officer, the Chief Compliance Officer, the General Auditor and other senior management with regard to the Company’s risk management processes, controls and capabilities.

The Risk Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors provides risk oversight on risk policies and the risk management performance of the Company. The Risk Committee approves key risk management policies and monitors the Company’s risk culture, talent, capabilities and risk outcomes. In particular, it approves the Company’s ERM policy along with its sub-policies governing individual credit risk, institutional credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, reputational risk, and asset/liability risk, as well as the launch of new products and services. The ERM policy sets the Company’s risk appetite and defines governance over risk taking and the risk monitoring processes across the Company. Risk appetite defines the overall risk levels the Company is willing to accept while operating in full compliance with regulatory and legal requirements. In addition, it establishes principles for risk taking in the aggregate and for each risk type, and is supported by a comprehensive system of risk limits, escalation triggers and controls designed to ensure that the risks remain within the defined risk appetite boundaries. Furthermore, the policy defines risk management roles and responsibilities.

The Risk Committee also regularly reviews the credit risk profile of the Company, risk trends and risk management capabilities. The Risk Committee receives regular updates from the Company’s Global Risk Oversight team, which reports to the Chief Risk Officer, on key risks affecting the Company, including transaction and exposure level approvals driven by policy-based risk escalations and risk limits.

The Risk Committee reviews enterprise-wide operational risk trends, events and capabilities, with an emphasis on compliance, fraud, legal, process or control failures, information security, and privacy impacts, as well as trends in market, funding, liquidity and reputational risk. The Risk Committee also provides risk oversight of the Company’s compliance with Basel capital and liquidity standards and its Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process, including its Comprehensive Capital and Review (CCAR) submissions.

As it relates to risk management, the Audit and Compliance Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors approves the Company’s compliance policies and compliance risk tolerance statement, which reinforces the importance of compliance risk management at the Company. In addition, the Audit and Compliance Committee reviews the effectiveness of the Company’s Corporate-wide Compliance Risk Management Program. More broadly, the Committee is responsible for assisting the Board of Directors in its oversight responsibilities relating to the integrity of the Company’s financial statements and financial reporting process; internal and external auditing, including the qualifications and independence of the independent registered public accounting firm and the performance of the Company’s internal audit services function; and the integrity of the Company’s systems of internal accounting and financial controls.

The Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors works with the Chief Risk Officer to ensure the compensation programs covering risk-taking employees, business units, and the Company overall appropriately balance risk with incentives such that business performance is achieved without taking imprudent or uneconomic risks. The Company’s Chief Risk Officer is actively involved in the goal-setting process, reviews the current and forward-looking risk profiles of each business unit, and provides input into performance evaluation. The Chief Risk Officer meets with the Compensation and Benefits Committee and attests that performance goals and actual results have been achieved without taking imprudent risks. The Compensation and Benefits Committee uses a risk-balanced incentive compensation framework to decide on the Company’s bonus pools and the compensation of senior executives.

There are several internal management committees, including the Enterprise-wide Risk Management Committee (ERMC), chaired by the Company’s Chief Risk Officer, and the Asset-Liability Committee (ALCO), chaired by the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, which oversee risks and implementation of risk policies across the Company with approval by the appropriate board committee. The ERMC is responsible for overseeing all risks, while the ALCO is responsible for managing market, liquidity, asset/liability risk, and the Company’s capital position.

As defined in the ERM policy, the Company follows the “three lines of defense” approach to risk management. The first line of defense comprises functions and management committees directly initiating risk taking. Business Unit presidents, the Chief Credit Officer of the Company, the Chief Operational Risk Officer, and the Chief Market Risk Officer are part of the first line of defense. The second line of defense comprises functions overseeing risk taking activities of the first line. The Global Risk Oversight (GRO) and Market Risk Oversight groups, the ERMC and certain control groups, both at the enterprise level and within regulated entities, are part of the second line of defense. The GRO oversees the framework and processes for managing credit, operational and model risks the Company faces and

 

43

Table of Contents
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY

2013 FINANCIAL REVIEW

 

acts as a check to the first line of defense managing these risks. The Internal Audit Group constitutes the third line of defense, and provides independent assurance that the first and second lines of defense operate as intended.

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS

Credit risk is defined as loss due to obligor or counterparty default or changes in the credit quality of a security. Credit risks in the Company are divided into two broad categories: individual and institutional. Each has distinct risk management tools and metrics. Business units that create individual or institutional credit risk exposures of significant importance are supported by dedicated risk management teams, each led by a Chief Credit Officer. To preserve independence, Chief Credit Officers for all business units report to the Chief Credit Officer of the Company, who in turn reports directly to the Company’s Chief Risk Officer.

INDIVIDUAL CREDIT RISK

Individual credit risk arises principally from consumer and small business charge cards, credit cards, lines of credit, and loans. These portfolios consist of millions of customers across multiple geographies, occupations, industries and levels of net worth. The Company benefits from the high-quality profile of its customers, which is driven by brand, premium customer servicing, product features and risk management capabilities, which span underwriting, customer management and collections. Externally, the risk in these portfolios is correlated to broad economic trends, such as unemployment rates and GDP growth, which can affect customer liquidity.

The business unit leaders and their Chief Credit Officers take the lead in managing the individual credit risk process. These Chief Credit Officers are guided by the Individual Credit Risk Committee, which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the Individual Credit Risk Management Policy. This policy is further supported by subordinate policies and operating manuals covering decision logic and processes of credit extension, including prospecting, new account approvals, authorizations, line management and collections. The subordinate risk policies and operating manuals are designed to ensure consistent application of risk management principles and standardized reporting of asset quality and loss recognition.

Individual credit risk management is supported by sophisticated proprietary scoring and decision-making models that use the most up-to-date proprietary information on prospects and customers, such as spending and payment history and data feeds from credit bureaus. Additional data, such as new commercial variables, continue to be integrated into the risk models to further mitigate small business risk. The Company has developed data-driven economic decision logic for customer interactions to better serve its customers.

INSTITUTIONAL CREDIT RISK

Institutional credit risk arises principally within the Company’s Global Corporate Payments, Global Merchant Services, GNS, Prepaid Services and Foreign Exchange Services businesses, as well as investment and liquidity management activities. Unlike individual credit risk, institutional credit risk is characterized by a lower loss frequency but higher severity. It is affected both by general economic conditions and by client-specific events. The absence of large losses in any given year or over several years is not necessarily representative of the level of risk of institutional portfolios, given the infrequency of loss events in such portfolios.

Similar to Individual Credit Risk, business units taking institutional credit risks are supported by Chief Credit Officers. These officers are guided by the Institutional Risk Management Committee (IRMC), which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the Institutional Credit Risk Management Policy and for providing guidance to the credit officers of each business unit with substantial institutional credit risk exposures. The committee, along with the business unit Chief Credit Officers, makes investment decisions in core risk capabilities, ensure proper implementation of the underwriting standards and contractual rights of risk mitigation, monitor risk exposures, and determine risk mitigation actions. The IRMC formally reviews large institutional risk exposures to ensure compliance with ERMC guidelines and procedures and escalates them to the ERMC as appropriate. At the same time, the IRMC provides guidance to the business unit risk teams to optimize risk-adjusted returns on capital. A centralized risk rating unit and a specialized airline risk group provide risk assessment of institutional obligors across the Company.

Exposure to the Airline Industry

The Company has multiple important co-brand, rewards and corporate payments arrangements with airlines. The Company’s largest airline partner is Delta Air Lines and this relationship includes exclusive co-brand credit card partnerships and other arrangements including Membership Rewards, merchant acceptance, travel and corporate payments. Refer to Note 22 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of these relationships.

Sovereign Debt Exposure

As part of its ongoing risk management process, the Company monitors its financial exposure to both sovereign and non-sovereign customers and counterparties, and measures and manages concentrations of risk by geographic regions, as well as by economic sectors and industries. A primary focus area for monitoring is credit deterioration due to weaknesses in economic and fiscal profiles. The Company evaluates countries based on the market assessment of the riskiness of their sovereign debt and the Company’s assessment of their economic and financial outlook and closely monitors those deemed high risk. As of December 31, 2013, the Company considers its gross credit exposures to government entities, financial institutions and corporations in those countries to be individually and collectively not material.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS

The Company defines operational risk as the risk of not achieving business objectives due to inadequate or failed processes, people, or information systems, or the external environment, including failures

 

44

Table of Contents
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY

2013 FINANCIAL REVIEW

 

to comply with laws and regulations. Operational risk is inherent in all business activities and can impact an organization through direct or indirect financial loss, brand damage, customer dissatisfaction, or legal and regulatory penalties.

To appropriately measure and manage operational risk, the Company has implemented a comprehensive operational risk framework that is defined in the Operational Risk Management Policy approved by the Risk Committee. The Operational Risk Management Committee (ORMC) coordinates with all control groups on effective risk assessments and controls and oversees the preventive, responsive and mitigation efforts by Lead Operational Risk Officers in the business units and staff groups. To preserve independence, the Lead Operational Risk Officers for all business units report to the Chief Operational Risk Officer of the Company, who in turn reports directly to the Company’s Chief Risk Officer.

The Company uses the operational risk framework to identify, measure, monitor and report inherent and emerging operational risks. This framework, supervised by the ORMC, consists of (a) operational risk event capture, (b) a project office to coordinate issue management and control enhancements, (c) key risk indicators such as customer complaints or pre-implementation test metrics, and (d) process and entity-level risk assessments.

The framework requires the assessment of operational risk events to determine root causes, impact to customers and/or the Company, and resolution plan accountability to correct any defect, remediate customers, and enhance controls and testing to mitigate future issues. The impact on the Company is assessed from an operational, financial, brand, regulatory compliance and legal perspective.

COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS

The Company defines compliance risk as the risk of legal or reputational harm, fines, monetary penalties, payment of damages or other forms of sanction as a result of non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations, rules or standards of conduct.

The Company views its ability to effectively mitigate compliance risk as an important aspect of its business model. The Company’s Global Compliance and Ethics organization is responsible for establishing and maintaining the Company’s Corporate-wide Compliance Risk Management Program. Pursuant to this program, the Company seeks to manage and mitigate compliance risk by assessing, controlling, monitoring, measuring and reporting the regulatory risks to which it is exposed.

REPUTATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS

The Company defines reputational risk as the risk that negative public perceptions regarding the Company’s products, services, business practices, management, clients and partners, whether true or not, could cause a decline in the customer base, costly litigation, or revenue reductions.

The Company views protecting its reputation as core to its vision of becoming the world’s most respected service brand and fundamental to its long-term success.

General principles and the overall framework for managing reputational risk across the Company are defined in the Reputational Risk Management Policy. The Reputational Risk Management Committee is responsible for implementation of and adherence to this policy, and for performing periodic assessments of the Company’s reputation and brand health based on internal and external assessments.

Business leaders across the Company are responsible for ensuring that reputation risk implications of transactions, business activities and management practices are appropriately considered and relevant subject matter experts are engaged as needed. In addition, the ERMC and its sub-committees are responsible for ensuring that reputational risk considerations are properly reflected in all decisions escalated to the committees.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS

Market risk is the risk to earnings or value resulting from movements in market prices. The Company’s market risk exposure is primarily generated by:

 

•	 	
Interest rate risk in its card, insurance and Travelers Cheque businesses, as well as in its investment portfolios; and

 

•	 	
Foreign exchange risk in its operations outside the U.S.

Market risk limits and escalation triggers within the Market Risk and Asset Liability Management Policies are approved by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors and the ERMC, based on recommendations by the ALCO. Market risk is centrally monitored for compliance with policy and limits by the Market Risk Committee, which reports into the ALCO and is chaired by the Chief Market Risk Officer. Market risk management is also guided by policies covering the use of derivative financial instruments, funding and liquidity and investments.

The Company’s market exposures are in large part by-products of the delivery of its products and services. Interest rate risk arises through the funding of Card Member receivables and fixed-rate loans with variable-rate borrowings as well as through the risk to net interest margin from changes in the relationship between benchmark rates such as Prime and LIBOR.

Interest rate exposure within the Company’s charge card and fixed-rate lending products is managed by varying the proportion of total funding provided by variable-rate debt and deposits compared to fixed-rate debt and deposits. In addition, interest rate swaps are used from time to time to effectively convert fixed-rate debt to variable-rate or to convert variable-rate debt to fixed-rate. The Company may change the mix between variable-rate and fixed-rate funding based on changes in business volumes and mix, among other factors.

The Company does not engage in derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Refer to Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s derivative financial instruments.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY

2013 FINANCIAL REVIEW

 

The Company analyzes a variety of scenarios to inform management of potential impacts to earnings and economic value of equity, which may occur given changes in interest rate curves using a range of severities. As of December 31, 2013, the detrimental effect on the Company’s annual net interest income of a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would be approximately $227 million. To calculate this effect, the Company first measures the potential change in net interest income over the following 12 months taking into consideration anticipated future business growth and market-based forward interest rates. The Company then measures the impact of the assumed forward interest rate plus the 100 basis point increase on the projected net interest income. This effect is primarily driven by the volume of charge card receivables and loans deemed to be fixed-rate and funded by variable-rate liabilities. As of December 31, 2013, the percentage of worldwide charge card accounts receivable and credit card loans that were deemed to be fixed rate was 67.6 percent, or $77 billion, with the remaining 32.4 percent, or $37 billion, deemed to be variable rate.

The Company is also subject to market risk from changes in the relationship between the benchmark Prime rate that determines the yield on its variable-rate lending receivables and the benchmark LIBOR rate that determines the effective interest cost on a significant portion of its outstanding debt. Differences in the rate of change of these two indices, commonly referred to as basis risk, would impact the Company’s variable-rate U.S. lending net interest margins because the Company borrows at rates based on LIBOR but lends to its customers based on the Prime rate. The detrimental effect on the Company’s net interest income of a hypothetical 10 basis point decrease in the spread between Prime and one-month LIBOR over the next 12 months is estimated to be $31 million. The Company currently has approximately $36 billion of Prime-based, variable-rate U.S. lending receivables and $31 billion of LIBOR-indexed debt, including asset securitizations.

Foreign exchange risk is generated by Card Member cross-currency charges, foreign subsidiary equity and foreign currency earnings in units outside the U.S. The Company’s foreign exchange risk is managed primarily by entering into agreements to buy and sell currencies on a spot basis or by hedging this market exposure to the extent it is economically justified through various means, including the use of derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward and cross-currency swap contracts, which can help “lock in” the value of the Company’s exposure to specific currencies.

As of both December 31, 2013 and 2012, foreign currency derivative instruments with total notional amounts of approximately $27 billion were outstanding. Derivative hedging activities related to cross-currency charges, balance sheet exposures and foreign currency earnings generally do not qualify for hedge accounting; however, derivative hedging activities related to translation exposure of foreign subsidiary equity generally do.

The Company conducts scenario analysis to inform management of potential impacts to earnings that may occur due to changes in foreign exchange rates of various severities. With respect to cross-currency charges and balance sheet exposures, including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding, the effect on the Company’s earnings of a hypothetical 10 percent change in the value of the U.S. dollar would be immaterial as of December 31, 2013. With respect to earnings denominated in foreign currencies, the adverse impact on pretax income of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar related to anticipated overseas operating results for the next 12 months would be approximately $192 million as of December 31, 2013. With respect to translation exposure of foreign subsidiary equity, including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding, a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening in the U.S. dollar would result in an immaterial reduction in equity as of December 31, 2013.

The actual impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate changes will depend on, among other factors, the timing of rate changes, the extent to which different rates do not move in the same direction or in the same direction to the same degree, changes in the cost, volume and mix of the Company’s hedging activities and changes in the volume and mix of the Company’s businesses.

FUNDING & LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS

Liquidity risk is defined as the inability of the Company to meet its ongoing financial and business obligations as they become due at a reasonable cost. General principles and the overall framework for managing liquidity risk across the Company are defined in the Liquidity Risk Policy approved by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors and the ALCO. Liquidity risk limits are approved by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors and the ERMC. Liquidity risk is centrally managed by the Funding and Liquidity Committee, which reports into the ALCO. The Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining access to a diverse set of cash, readily-marketable securities and contingent sources of liquidity, such that the Company can continuously meet its business requirements and expected future financing obligations for at least a 12-month period, even in the event it is unable to raise new funds under its regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions. The Company balances the trade-offs between maintaining too much liquidity, which can be costly and limit financial flexibility, and having inadequate liquidity, which may result in financial distress during a liquidity event.

Liquidity risk is managed both at an aggregate company level and at the major legal entities in order to ensure that sufficient funding and liquidity resources are available in the amount and in the location needed in a stress event. The Funding and Liquidity Committee reviews the forecasts of the Company’s aggregate and subsidiary cash positions and financing requirements, approves the funding plans designed to satisfy those requirements under normal conditions, establishes guidelines to identify the amount of liquidity resources required and monitors positions and determines any actions to be taken. Liquidity planning also takes into account operating cash flexibilities.

Reserves for Card Member losses represent management’s best estimate of the probable losses inherent in the Company’s outstanding portfolio of Card Member loans and receivables, as of the balance sheet date.

In estimating these losses, management uses statistical and analytical models that take into account several factors, including loss migration rates, loss emergence periods, historical losses and recoveries, portfolio specific risk indicators, current risk management initiatives and concentration of credit risk. Management also considers other external environmental factors in establishing reserves for Card Member losses.

The process of estimating these reserves requires a high degree of judgment. To the extent historical credit experience updated for external environmental trends is not indicative of future performance, actual losses could differ significantly from management’s judgments and expectations, resulting in either higher or lower future provisions for Card Member losses in any quarter.

As of December 31, 2013, a 10 percent increase in management’s estimate of losses inherent in the outstanding portfolio of Card Member loans and receivables evaluated collectively for impairment at such date would increase reserves for Card Member losses with a corresponding change to provision for Card Member losses by approximately $165 million. This sensitivity analysis is provided as a hypothetical scenario to assess the sensitivity of the provision for Card Member losses. It does not represent management’s expectations for losses in the future, nor does it include how other portfolio factors such as loss migration rates or recoveries, or the amount of outstanding balances, may impact the level of reserves for Card Member losses and the corresponding impact on the provision for Card Member losses.

LIABILITY FOR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS EXPENSE

The Membership Rewards program is the Company’s largest card-based rewards program. Card Members can earn points for purchases charged on their enrolled card products. Certain types of purchases allow Card Members to also earn bonus points. Membership Rewards points are redeemable for a broad variety of rewards including travel, entertainment, retail certificates and merchandise. Points typically do not expire, and there is no limit on the number of points a Card Member may earn.

The Company records a Membership Rewards liability that represents the estimated cost of points earned that are expected to be redeemed by Card Members in the future. The Membership Rewards liability is impacted over time by enrollment levels, points earned and redeemed, and the weighted-average cost per point, which is influenced by redemption choices made by Card Members, reward offerings by partners and other Membership Rewards program changes. The liability reflects management’s judgment regarding ultimate redemptions and associated redemption costs. Actual redemptions and associated redemption costs could differ significantly from management’s judgment resulting in either higher or lower Membership Rewards expense.

Management uses statistical and actuarial models to estimate URRs of points earned to date by current Card Members based on redemption trends of current enrollees, card product type, enrollment tenure, card spend levels and credit attributes. A WAC per point redeemed during the previous 12 months, adjusted as appropriate for certain changes in redemption costs that are not representative of future cost expectations, is used to estimate future redemption costs. Management periodically evaluates its liability estimation process and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns, cost per point redeemed, partner contract changes and other factors.

Changes in the Membership Rewards URR and WAC per point have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the liability through the current period marketing, promotion, rewards and Card Member services expense by an amount estimated to cover the cost of all points previously earned but not yet redeemed by current enrollees as of the end of the reporting period. As of December 31, 2013, an increase in the estimated URR of current enrollees of 100 basis points would increase the balance sheet liability and corresponding expense for the cost of Membership Rewards by approximately $290 million. Similarly, an increase in the WAC per point of 1 basis point would increase the balance sheet liability and corresponding expense for the cost of Membership Rewards by approximately $86 million.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

The Company holds investment securities and derivative instruments that are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management makes assumptions and judgments when estimating the fair values of these financial instruments.

In accordance with fair value measurement and disclosure guidance, the objective of a fair value measurement is to determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date based on the principal or, in the absence of a principal, most advantageous market for the specific asset or liability. The disclosure guidance establishes a three-level hierarchy of inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to the measurement of fair value based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1), followed by the measurement of fair value based on pricing models with significant observable inputs (Level 2), with the lowest priority given to the measurement of fair value based on pricing models with significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). The Company did not have any Level 3 assets measured on a recurring

basis during the year ended December 31, 2013. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Investment Securities

The Company’s investment securities are mostly composed of fixed-income securities issued by states and municipalities as well as the U.S. Government and Agencies.

The fair market values for the Company’s investment securities, including investments comprising defined benefit pension plan assets, are obtained primarily from pricing services engaged by the Company. For each security, the Company receives one price from a pricing service. The fair values provided by the pricing services are estimated using pricing models, where the inputs to those models are based on observable market inputs or recent trades of similar securities. The pricing services did not apply any adjustments to the pricing models used as of December 31, 2013 and 2012. In addition, the Company did not apply any adjustments to prices received from the pricing services. The Company reaffirms its understanding of the valuation techniques used by its pricing services at least annually. In addition, the Company corroborates the prices provided by its pricing services for reasonableness by comparing the prices from the respective pricing services to valuations obtained from different pricing sources as well as comparing prices to the sale prices received from sold securities at least quarterly.

In the measurement of fair value for the Company’s investment securities, even though the underlying inputs used in the pricing models are directly observable from active markets or recent trades of similar securities in inactive markets, the pricing models do entail a certain amount of subjectivity and therefore differing judgments in how the underlying inputs are modeled could result in different estimates of fair value.

Other-Than-Temporary Impairment of Investment Securities

Realized losses are recognized when management determines that a decline in the fair value of investment securities is other-than-temporary. Such determination requires judgment regarding the amount and timing of recovery. The Company reviews and evaluates its investment securities at least quarterly, and more often as market conditions may require, to identify investment securities that have indications of other-than-temporary impairments. The Company considers several factors when evaluating debt securities for other-than-temporary impairment, including the determination of the extent to which a decline in the fair value of a security is due to increased default risk for the specific issuer or market interest rate risk. With respect to market interest rate risk, the Company assesses whether it has the intent to sell the investment securities and whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investment securities before recovery of any unrealized losses.

In determining whether any of the Company’s investment securities are other-than-temporarily impaired, a change in facts and circumstances could lead to a change in management judgment about the Company’s view on collectability and credit quality of the issuer, or the impact of market interest rates on the investment securities. Any such changes could result in the Company recognizing an other-than-temporary impairment loss through earnings.

Derivative Instruments

The Company’s primary derivative instruments are interest rate swaps, foreign currency forward agreements, cross-currency swaps and a total return swap relating to a foreign equity investment.

The fair value of the Company’s derivative instruments is estimated by using either a third-party valuation service that uses proprietary pricing models, or by internal pricing models, where the inputs to those models are readily observable from actively quoted markets. The Company reaffirms its understanding of the valuation techniques used by a third-party valuation service at least annually.

To mitigate credit risk arising from the Company’s derivative instruments, counterparties are required to be pre-approved and rated as investment grade. In addition, the Company manages certain counterparty credit risks by exchanging cash and noncash collateral under executed credit support agreements. The noncash collateral does not reduce the derivative balance reflected in the other assets line but effectively reduces risk exposure as it is available in the event of counterparty default. Based on the assessment of credit risk of the Company’s derivative counterparties, the Company does not have derivative positions that warrant credit valuation adjustments.

In the measurement of fair value for the Company’s derivative instruments, although the underlying inputs used in the pricing models are readily observable from actively quoted markets, the pricing models do entail a certain amount of subjectivity and, therefore, differing judgments in how the underlying inputs are modeled could result in different estimates of fair value.

GOODWILL RECOVERABILITY

Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost of an acquired company over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or when events or circumstances arise, such as adverse changes in the business climate, that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. The Company’s approach and methodology for conducting its goodwill impairment testing is described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, but is fundamentally based on the measurement of fair value for the Company’s reporting units, which inherently entails the use of significant judgment.

For valuation, the Company uses a combination of the income approach (discounted cash flows) and market approach (market multiples) in estimating the fair value of its reporting units.

When preparing discounted cash flow models under the income approach, the Company estimates future cash flows using the reporting unit’s internal multi-year forecast, and a terminal value calculated using a growth rate that management believes is appropriate in light of current and expected future economic

conditions. To discount these cash flows the Company uses its expected cost of equity, determined using a capital asset pricing model. When using the market method under the market approach, the Company applies comparable publically traded companies’ multiples (e.g., earnings, revenues) to its reporting units’ actual results. The judgment in estimating forecasted cash flows, discount rates and market comparables is significant, and imprecision could materially affect the fair value of the Company’s reporting units.

Based upon the updated valuations for the Company’s reporting units, the Company has concluded goodwill is not impaired as of December 31, 2013, nor was any goodwill written off during 2013. However, the Company could be exposed to increased risk of goodwill impairment if future operating results or macroeconomic conditions differ significantly from management’s current assumptions.

INCOME TAXES

The Company is subject to the income tax laws of the U.S., its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which the Company operates. These tax laws are complex, and the manner in which they apply to the taxpayer’s facts is sometimes open to interpretation. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, the Company must make judgments about the application of inherently complex tax laws.

Unrecognized Tax Benefits

The Company establishes a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which are the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit recognized in the financial statements.

In establishing a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit, assumptions may be made in determining whether, and the extent to which, a tax position should be sustained. A tax position is recognized only when it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority based on its technical merits. The amount of tax benefit recognized is the largest benefit that management believes is more likely than not to be realized on ultimate settlement. As new information becomes available, the Company evaluates its tax positions, and adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits, as appropriate.

Tax benefits ultimately realized can differ from amounts previously recognized due to uncertainties, with any such differences generally impacting the provision for income tax.

Deferred Tax Asset Realization

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.

Since deferred taxes measure the future tax effects of items recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements, certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making this assessment, management analyzes and estimates the impact of future taxable income, reversing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies. These assessments are performed quarterly, taking into account any new information.

Changes in facts or circumstances can lead to changes in the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets due to uncertainties.

OTHER MATTERS

CERTAIN LEGISLATIVE, REGULATORY AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS

As a participant in the financial services industry and as a bank holding company, the Company is subject to comprehensive examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve and to a range of laws and regulations that impact its business and operations. In light of legislative initiatives over the last several years and continuing regulatory reform implementation, compliance requirements and expenditures have risen for financial services firms, including the Company, and the Company expects compliance requirements and expenditures will continue to rise in the future.

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) contains a wide array of provisions intended to govern the practices and oversight of financial institutions and other participants in the financial markets. Among other matters, the law created an independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the CFPB), which has broad rulemaking authority over providers of credit, savings, payment and other consumer financial products and services with respect to certain federal consumer financial laws. Moreover, the CFPB has examination and enforcement authority with respect to certain federal consumer financial laws for providers of consumer financial products and services, including the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. The CFPB is directed to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts or practices, and to ensure that all consumers have access to fair, transparent and competitive markets for consumer financial products and services.

The review of products and practices to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive conduct will be a continuing focus of the CFPB and banking regulators more broadly, as well as by the Company itself. Internal and regulatory reviews have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, changes to the Company’s practices, products and procedures. Such reviews are also likely to continue to result in increased costs related to regulatory oversight, supervision and examination and additional restitution to the Company’s Card Members and may result in additional regulatory actions, including civil money penalties.

In December 2013, the Company announced that certain of its subsidiaries reached settlements with several banking regulators, including the CFPB, to resolve regulatory reviews of marketing and billing practices related to several credit card add-on products. For a description of these settlements, see “Legal Proceedings” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013.

In October 2012, the Company announced that it and certain of its subsidiaries reached settlements with several bank regulators, including the CFPB, relating to certain aspects of the Company’s U.S. consumer card practices, which requires the Company to undertake certain actions that will continue in 2014. For a description of these settlements, see “Legal Proceedings” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012.

Dodd-Frank prohibits payment card networks from restricting merchants from offering discounts or incentives to customers to pay with particular forms of payment, such as cash, check, credit or debit card, or restricting merchants from setting certain minimum, and for certain merchants maximum, transaction amounts for credit cards, as long as any such discounts or incentives or any minimum or maximum transaction amounts do not discriminate on the basis of the issuer or network and comply with applicable federal or state disclosure requirements.

Under Dodd-Frank, the Federal Reserve is also authorized to regulate interchange fees paid to financial institutions on debit card and certain general-use prepaid card transactions to ensure that they are “reasonable and proportional” to the cost of processing individual transactions, and to prohibit payment card networks and issuers from requiring transactions to be processed on a single payment network or fewer than two unaffiliated networks. The Federal Reserve’s rule provides that the regulations on interchange and routing do not apply to a three-party network like American Express when it acts as both the issuer and the network for its prepaid cards, and the Company is therefore not a “payment card network” as that term is defined and used for the specific purposes of the rule.

Dodd-Frank also authorizes the Federal Reserve to establish enhanced prudential regulatory requirements, including capital, leverage and liquidity standards, risk management requirements, concentration limits on credit exposures, mandatory resolution plans (so-called “living wills”) and stress tests for, among others, large bank holding companies, such as the Company, that have greater than $50 billion in assets. The Company is also required to develop and maintain a “capital plan,” and to submit the capital plan to the Federal Reserve for its quantitative and qualitative review under the Federal Reserve’s CCAR process. In addition, certain derivative transactions are now required to be centrally cleared, which will increase collateral posting requirements for the Company.

Many provisions of Dodd-Frank require the adoption of additional rules or regulatory guidance for complete implementation. In addition, Dodd-Frank mandates multiple studies, which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action. Accordingly, the ultimate consequences of Dodd-Frank and its implementing regulations on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition continues to be uncertain at this time.

Department of Justice Litigation

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and certain states attorneys general have brought an action against the Company alleging that the provisions in the Company’s card acceptance agreements with merchants that prohibit merchants from discriminating against the Company’s card products at the point of sale violate the U.S. antitrust laws. See Item 1. “Legal Proceedings” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, for descriptions of the DOJ action and related cases. Visa and MasterCard, which were also defendants in the DOJ and state action, entered into a settlement agreement and have been dismissed as parties pursuant to that agreement. The settlement enjoins Visa and MasterCard, with certain exceptions, from adopting or enforcing rules or entering into contracts that prohibit merchants from engaging in various actions to steer cardholders to other card products or payment forms at the point of sale. If similar conditions were imposed on American Express, it could have a material adverse effect on American Express’ business.

Other Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives

The payment card sector also faces continuing scrutiny in connection with the fees merchants pay to accept cards and terms of merchant rules and contracts. Regulators and legislators outside the U.S. have focused on the way bankcard network members collectively set the “interchange” (that is, the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in “four-party” payment networks, like Visa and MasterCard). Although, unlike the Visa and MasterCard networks, the American Express “three-party” payment network does not have interchange fees or collectively set any fees, antitrust actions and government regulation relating to merchant pricing or terms of merchant rules and contracts could affect all networks.

In January 2012, the European Commission (the Commission) published a Green Paper (a document to begin a process of consultation toward potential regulation) covering a range of issues affecting the payments industry. The Commission completed the consultation process and on July 24, 2013, issued its recommendations, which included draft legislation now under consideration within the European Parliament. The Commission’s recommendations included a number of proposals that would likely have significant impact across the industry and would apply either in whole or in part to American Express. The proposed changes include:

 

•	 	
Price caps — The Commission proposed capping interchange fees at 20 basis points for debit and prepaid cards and 30 basis points for credit and charge cards. Although American Express does not have interchange fees like four-party networks such as Visa and MasterCard have, the caps would be deemed to apply to elements of the financial arrangements agreed between American Express and each GNS partner in the European Union (the EU). The discount rates American Express agrees with merchants would not be capped, but the interchange caps could exert downward pressures on merchant fees across the industry, including American Express discount rates. The Commission would exclude commercial card transactions generally from the scope of these caps.

 

•	 	
Network rules on card acceptance — The Commission proposed to prohibit honor-all-cards and anti-steering rules across all card networks. In addition, the draft proposals sought harmonization of surcharging rules so that, across the EU, transactions that are subject to the interchange caps may not be surcharged, but transactions falling outside the scope of the caps could be surcharged up to cost.

 

•	 	
Network licensing — The Commission proposed to require all networks, including three-party payment networks that operate with licensing arrangements, which would include the Company’s GNS business, to establish objective, proportionate and non-discriminatory criteria under which a financial institution could qualify to be licensed to operate on the network. In addition, the scope of network licenses would be required to cover the entire EU. These requirements are inconsistent with the flexibility and discretion that American Express has had to date in deciding when, where and with whom to grant a license in the GNS business.

 

•	 	
Separation of network processing — The Commission proposed to require card networks to separate their network processing functions (in which transactions between different issuers and acquirers are processed for authorization, clearing and settlement). This proposal does not apply to three-party payment networks, such as American Express, but may be deemed applicable in situations where a different GNS issuer and acquirer is involved in a transaction, which represent a very small percentage of transactions on the American Express network. Further clarification of the applicability of this requirement is needed where, as with GNS, licensing arrangements do not give rise to inter-bank transactions or relationships.

These proposals are currently subject to debate and amendment by the European Parliament and Council in a complex legislative process that will also involve the EC. It is too early to assess the exact scope and impact of any final legislation.

In certain countries, such as Australia, and in certain member states in the EU, merchants are permitted by law to surcharge card purchases. While surcharging continues to be actively considered in certain jurisdictions, the benefits to customers have not been apparent in countries that have allowed it, and in some cases regulators are addressing concerns about excessive surcharging by merchants. Surcharging, particularly where it disproportionately impacts American Express Card Members, which is known as differential surcharging, could have a material adverse effect on the Company if it becomes widespread. The Reserve Bank of Australia changed the Australian surcharging standards beginning March 18, 2013 to allow the Company and other networks to limit a merchant’s right to surcharge to “the reasonable cost of card acceptance.” In the EU, the Consumer Rights Directive, prohibits merchants from surcharging

2013 FINANCIAL REVIEW

 

card purchases more than the merchants’ cost of acceptance in those member states that permit surcharging.

Although neither a legislative nor regulatory initiative, the settlement by MasterCard and Visa in a U.S. merchant class litigation required, among other things, MasterCard and Visa to permit U.S. merchants, subject to certain conditions, to surcharge credit cards, while allowing them to continue to prohibit surcharges on debit and prepaid card transactions. In December 2013, we announced the proposed settlement of a number of U.S. merchant class action lawsuits, which if approved, would change certain surcharging provisions in our U.S. card acceptance agreements. For a further description of the proposed settlement, see Item 1. “Legal Proceedings” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013.

Also, other countries in which the Company operates have been considering, and in some cases adopting similar legislation and rules that would impose changes on certain practices of card issuers, merchant acquirers and payment networks. Governments in several countries have established or are proposing to establish payment system regulatory regimes. Broad regulatory oversight over payment systems can include rules regarding fees involved in the operation of card networks and, in some cases, requirements for international card networks to be locally licensed and/or to localize aspects of their operations. The development and enforcement of regulatory regimes may adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and extend our global network.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

Refer to the Recently Issued Accounting Standards section of Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

GLOSSARY OF SELECTED TERMINOLOGY

Adjusted average loans — Represents average Card Member loans excluding the impact of deferred card fees, net of direct acquisition costs of Card Member loans and certain other immaterial items.

Adjusted net interest income — Represents net interest income attributable to the Company’s Card Member loans portfolio excluding the impact of interest expense and interest income not attributable to the Company’s Card Member loans portfolio.

Asset securitizations — Asset securitization involves the transfer and sale of receivables or loans to a special-purpose entity created for the securitization activity, typically a trust. The trust, in turn, issues securities, commonly referred to as asset-backed securities, that are secured by the transferred receivables or loans. The trust uses the proceeds from the sale of such securities to pay the purchase price for the underlying receivables or loans. The receivables and loans of the Company’s Charge Trust II and Lending Trust being securitized are reported as assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Average discount rate — This calculation is designed to reflect pricing at merchants accepting general purpose American Express cards. It represents the percentage of billed business (both proprietary and GNS) retained by the Company from merchants it acquires, prior to payments to third parties unrelated to merchant acceptance.

Basel III supplementary leverage ratio — Refer to the Capital Strategy section under “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity” for the definition.

Basic cards-in-force — Proprietary basic consumer cards-in-force includes basic cards issued to the primary account owner and does not include additional supplemental cards issued on that account. Proprietary basic small business and corporate cards-in-force include basic and supplemental cards issued to employee Card Members. Non-proprietary basic cards-in-force includes cards that are issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements, except for supplemental cards and retail co-brand Card Member accounts which have had no out-of-store spend activity during the prior 12-month period.

Billed business — Includes activities (including cash advances) related to proprietary cards, cards issued under network partnership agreements (non-proprietary billed business), corporate payments and certain insurance fees charged on proprietary cards. In-store spend activity within retail co-brand portfolios in GNS, from which the Company earns no revenue, is not included in non-proprietary billed business. Card billed business is reflected in the U.S. or outside the U.S. based on where the Card Member is domiciled.

Capital asset pricing model — Generates an appropriate discount rate using internal and external inputs to value future cash flows based on the time value of money and the price for bearing uncertainty inherent in an investment.

Capital ratios — Represents the minimum standards established by the regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether the regulated entity has sufficient capital to absorb on- and off-balance sheet losses beyond current loss accrual estimates.

Card acquisition — Primarily represents the issuance of new cards to either new or existing Card Members through marketing and promotion efforts.

Card Member — The individual holder of an issued American Express branded charge or credit card.

Card Member loans — Represents the outstanding amount due from Card Members for charges made on their American Express credit cards, as well as any interest charges and card-related fees. Card Member loans also include revolving balances on certain American Express charge card products and are net of deferred card fees.

Card Member receivables — Represents the outstanding amount due from Card Members for charges made on their American Express charge cards as well as any card-related fees.

Charge cards — Represents cards that generally carry no pre-set spending limits and are primarily designed as a method of payment and not as a means of financing purchases. Charge Card Members generally must pay the full amount billed each month. No finance charges are assessed on charge cards. Each charge card transaction is authorized based on its likely economics reflecting a customer’s most recent credit information and spend patterns. Some charge card accounts have an additional lending-on-charge feature that allows revolving certain balances.

Credit cards — Represents cards that have a range of revolving payment terms, grace periods, and rate and fee structures.

Discount revenue — Represents revenue earned from fees generally charged to merchants with whom the Company has entered into a card acceptance agreement for processing Card Member transactions. The discount fee generally is deducted from the Company’s payment reimbursing the merchant for Card Member purchases. Discount revenue is reduced by other payments made to merchants, third-party card issuing partners, cash-back reward costs, corporate incentive payments and other contra-revenue items.

Interest expense — Interest expense includes interest incurred primarily to fund Card Member loans, charge card product receivables, general corporate purposes, and liquidity needs, and is recognized as incurred. Interest expense is divided principally into two categories: (i) deposits, which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions and (ii) long-term debt, which primarily relates to interest expense on the Company’s long-term financing and short-term borrowings, which primarily relates to interest expense on commercial paper, federal funds purchased, bank overdrafts and other short-term borrowings.

Interest income — Interest income includes (i) interest on loans, (ii) interest and dividends on investment securities and (iii) interest income on deposits with banks and others.

Interest on loans — is assessed using the average daily balance method for loans. Unless the loan is classified as non-accrual, interest is recognized based upon the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the terms of the applicable account agreement until the outstanding balance is paid or written off.

Interest and dividends on investment securities — primarily relates to the Company’s performing fixed-income securities. Interest income is accrued as earned using the effective interest method, which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts, fees and other payments, so that the related investment security recognizes a constant rate of return on the outstanding balance throughout its term. These amounts are recognized until these securities are in default or when it is likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled.

Interest income on deposits with banks and other — is recognized as earned, and primarily relates to the placement of cash in excess of near-term funding requirements in interest-bearing time deposits, overnight sweep accounts, and other interest bearing demand and call accounts.

Merchant acquisition — Represents the signing of merchants to accept American Express-branded cards.

Net card fees — Represents the card membership fees earned during the period. These fees are recognized as revenue over the covered card membership period (typically one year), net of provision for projected refunds for cancellation of card membership.

Net interest yield on Card Member loans — Net interest yield on Card Member loans is computed by dividing adjusted net interest income by adjusted average loans, computed on an annualized basis. The calculation of net interest yield on Card Member loans includes interest that is deemed uncollectible. For all presentations of net interest yield on Card Member loans, reserves and net write-offs related to uncollectible interest are recorded through provisions for losses — Card Member loans; therefore, such reserves and net write-offs are not included in the net interest yield calculation.

Net loss ratio — Represents the ratio of ICS and GCS charge card write-offs consisting of principal (resulting from authorized and unauthorized transactions) and fee components, less recoveries, on Card Member receivables expressed as a percentage of gross amounts billed to Card Members.

Net write-off rate — principal only — Represents the amount of Card Member loans or USCS Card Member receivables written off consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions), less recoveries, as a percentage of the average loan balance or USCS average receivables during the period.

Net write-off rate — principal, interest and fees — Includes, in the calculation of the net write-off rate, amounts for interest and fees in addition to principal for Card Member loans, and fees in addition to principal for USCS Card Member receivables.

Operating expenses — Represents salaries and employee benefits, professional services, occupancy and equipment, communications and other expenses.

Return on average equity — Calculated by dividing one-year period net income by one-year average total shareholders’ equity.

Return on average segment capital — Calculated by dividing one-year period segment income by one-year average segment capital.

Return on average tangible segment capital — Computed in the same manner as return on average segment capital except the computation of average tangible segment capital excludes from average segment capital average goodwill and other intangibles.

Risk-weighted assets — Refer to the Capital Strategy section under “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity” for the definitions under Basel I and Basel III.

Segment capital — Represents the capital allocated to a segment based upon specific business operational needs, risk measures and regulatory capital requirements.

Three-party network — A payment network, such as American Express, that acts as both the card issuer and merchant acquirer.

Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio — Refer to the Capital Strategy section under “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity” for the definitions under Basel I and Basel III.

Tier 1 leverage ratio — Refer to the Capital Strategy section under “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity” for the definitions under Basel I and Basel III.

•	 	
the ability to hold annual operating expense growth to less than 3 percent during 2014, which will depend in part on unanticipated increases in significant categories of operating expenses, such as consulting or professional fees, compliance or regulatory-related costs and technology costs, the payment of monetary damages and penalties, disgorgement and restitution, the Company’s decision to increase or decrease discretionary operating expenses depending on overall business performance, the Company’s ability to achieve the expected benefits of the Company’s reengineering plans, which will be impacted by, among other things, the factors identified in the third bullet below, the Company’s ability to balance expense control and investments in the business, the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on costs and results, the impact of accounting changes and reclassifications, and the level of acquisition activity and related expenses;

 

•	 	
the actual amount to be spent by the Company on investments in the business, including on marketing, promotion, rewards and Card Member services and certain operating expenses and in such areas as affluent consumers, small businesses, business-to-business payments, merchant coverage, international growth, prepaid and online/mobile commerce, as well as the actual amount of any potential gain arising from the proposed GBT joint venture transaction the Company decides to invest in growth initiatives, which will be based in part on management’s assessment of competitive opportunities and the Company’s performance and the ability to control operating, infrastructure, advertising, promotion and rewards expenses as business expands or changes, including the changing behavior of Card Members;

 

•	 	
changes affecting the Company’s ability or desire to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of its common shares in the first quarter of 2014, such as acquisitions, results of operations, capital needs and the amount of shares issued by the Company to employees upon the exercise of options, among other factors, which will significantly impact the potential decrease in the Company’s capital ratios;

 

•	 	
the possibility of not achieving the expected timing and financial impact of the Company’s reengineering plans, which could be caused by factors such as the Company’s inability to mitigate the operational and other risks posed by planned staff reductions, the Company’s inability to develop and implement technology resources to realize cost savings, underestimating hiring needs related to some of the job positions being eliminated and other employee needs not currently anticipated, lower than expected attrition rates and higher than expected redeployment rates;

 

•	 	
the ability of the Company to meet its on-average and over-time growth targets for revenues net of interest expense, earnings per share and return on average equity, which will depend on factors such as the Company’s success in implementing its strategies and business initiatives including growing the Company’s share of overall spending, increasing merchant coverage, enhancing its pre-paid offerings, expanding the GNS business and controlling expenses, and on factors outside management’s control including the willingness of Card Members to sustain spending, the effectiveness of marketing and loyalty programs, regulatory and market pressures on pricing, credit trends, currency and interest rate fluctuations, and changes in general economic conditions, such as GDP growth, consumer confidence, unemployment and the housing market;

 

•	 	
the ability of the Company to meet its on-average and over-time objective to return 50 percent of capital generated to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which will depend on factors such as approval of the Company’s capital plans by its regulators, the amount the Company spends on acquisitions, the Company’s results of operations and capital needs in any given period, and the amount of shares issued by the Company to employees upon the exercise of options;

the Company’s funding plan for the full year 2014 being implemented in a manner inconsistent with current expectations, which will depend on various factors such as future business growth, the impact of global economic, political and other events on market capacity, demand for securities offered by the Company, regulatory changes, ability to securitize and sell receivables and the performance of receivables previously sold in securitization transactions;

•	 	
the impact of final laws and regulations, if any, arising from the European Commission’s legislative proposals covering a range of issues affecting the payments industry, which will depend on various factors, including, but not limited to, the issues presented and decisions made in the European legislative and regulatory processes addressing the proposed regulation of interchange fees and other practices related to card-based payment transactions, the amount of time these processes take to reach completion, and the actual pricing and other requirements ultimately adopted in the final laws and regulations in the European Union and its member states;
