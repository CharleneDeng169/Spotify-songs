Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and the other financial information found elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The following discussion includes forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties. See "Disclosures Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" (immediately prior to Part I) and Item 1A. Risk Factors. Each of our segments is organized and managed based upon both geographic location and the nature of the products and services it offers: North America E&P explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas in North America; International E&P explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas outside of North America and produces and markets products manufactured from natural gas, such as LNG and methanol, in E.G.; and Oil Sands Mining mines, extracts and transports bitumen from oil sands deposits in Alberta, Canada, and upgrades the bitumen to produce and market synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil. Executive Summary During 2016 we continued our efforts on capital and operating cost management, simplifying and concentrating our portfolio, and maintaining balance sheet strength and flexibility. In 2016, we achieved $1.3 billion of non-core asset sales which allowed us to be opportunistic with a high quality acquisition in Oklahoma's STACK play. As a result, we further simplified and concentrated our portfolio to the lower cost, higher margin assets in the U.S. resource plays. Looking ahead, our goal is to return to annual production growth for both the company and U.S. resource plays, within cash flows. Our 2016 accomplishments are summarized below: Relentless focus on costs Reduced 2016 Capital Program spend to $1.1 billion, below $1.4 billion original budget Reduced production expenses per boe in 2016 North America E&P - 19% reduction to $5.96 per boe International E&P - 16% reduction to $5.05 per boe Oil Sands Mining - 24% reduction to $27.89 per boe Reduced average completed well costs in 2016 by 22% in the Oklahoma Resource Basins and 26% in Eagle Ford compared to 2015 Decreased total general and administrative costs by 18% in 2016 compared to last year Simplifying and concentrating portfolio Closed on the Oklahoma STACK acquisition of 61,000 net acres Concentrated asset base to lower cost, higher margin resource plays by closing on $1.3 billion in non-core asset sales Strengthened balance sheet Increased our liquidity to $5.8 billion at December 31, 2016 compared to $4.2 billion at December 31, 2015 Raised net $1.2 billion from an equity offering in the first quarter of 2016 Expanded the capacity of the revolving credit facility from $3.0 billion to $3.3 billion in the first quarter of 2016 Improved our cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio to 21% at December 31, 2016 compared to 25% at December 31, 2015 Profitable growth within cash flows Increased U.S. resource play rig count by 50 percent in fourth quarter of 2016, while remaining under budget, and positioning to resume sequential production growth in the resource plays in the first half of 2017 Our 2016 significant operational updates and financial results included the following: Operational Updates Total company net sales volumes of 404 mboed in 2016 We ended 2016 with 2,096 mmboe of proved reserves, with extension, discovery and other additions of 304 mmboe 30 Increased net sales volumes by 40% in the Oklahoma Resource Basins as we increased activity on our STACK and SCOOP acreage Delivered basin-leading well results in the Bakken supported by enhanced completions and advantaged geology, while reducing production expense by approximately 30% year-over-year Achieved record drilling efficiency in the Eagle Ford and record low completed costs during 2016 while continuing to execute high intensity completions Completed the Alba B3 Compression project in E.G., extending plateau production and field life Resumed liftings in Libya in December 2016; Force Majeure lifted in September 2016 Ended the year with 12 rigs operating in the U.S. resource plays Financial results 2016 net loss of $2.1 billion versus 2015 net loss of $2.2 billion; included in the loss for 2016: Non-cash charge related to a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets of $1.3 billion (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements) Reduction in segment sales revenues of $1.2 billion with a nearly even split between lower price realizations and decreased sales volumes Non-cash charge of $262 million for proved and unproved property impairments (See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 13 to the consolidated financial statement for additional detail) Net cash provided by operating activities in 2016 was $1.1 billion , compared to $1.6 billion in 2015 , reflecting the lower segment revenues 31 Outlook Capital Program Our $2.2 billion 2017 Capital Program will have over 90% allocated to the higher return, lower cost U.S. resource plays. We intend to ramp up activity in Oklahoma as we progress our STACK and SCOOP acreage toward full field development, and in the Bakken where our enhanced completions recently achieved record results. Additionally, our Eagle Ford asset will continue to focus on driving capital efficiencies. Our 2017 Capital Program is broken down by reportable operating segment in the table below: (In millions) Capital Program North America E&P $ 2,107 International E&P 64 Oil Sands Mining 29 Segment total 2,200 Corporate and other 25 Total Capital Program $ 2,225 North America E&P Approximately $2 billion of our 2017 Capital Program is allocated about one-third to each of our three core U.S. resource plays as follows: Oklahoma Resource Basins - we expect to focus on STACK leasehold retention, STACK delineation and infill pilots in preparation for full field development. We plan to increase our Oklahoma rig count to average approximately 10 rigs in 2017, while bringing 90 to 100 gross operated wells to sales during the year. This includes four to five STACK infill pilots and two SCOOP infill pilots to sales, as well as testing additional secondary horizons. Eagle Ford - we expect to maintain a six-rig drilling program and bring 155 to 170 gross operated wells to sales during 2017. With about two-thirds of the program focused in the high margin oil window, we plan to continue optimizing completion techniques with increased proppant and fluid loading, and average lateral lengths. Bakken - we plan to focus on our highest return West and East Myrmidon areas where we completed several basin-leading wells in 2016. We will progress multiple enhanced completion trials as well as continue our focus on optimizing base production, while bringing 70 to 75 gross operated wells to sales during 2017. We expect to average approximately six drilling rigs in the Bakken in 2017. International E&P, Oil Sands Mining, Corporate and other Less than 10% of our Capital Program will be allocated to these segments for sustaining capital projects. Operations Our net sales volumes from continuing operations averaged 404 mboed, 438 mboed and 415 mboed for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 . Net sales volumes from continuing operations decreased by 8% to 404 mboed in 2016 relating to dispositions of certain non-core assets ( 23 mboed from Wyoming, West Texas, East Texas, North Louisiana and Gulf of Mexico) during the comparison period as well as lower completion activity in the U.S resource plays. As liftings from Libya were sporadic during this 3-year period, a more representative comparison is net sales volumes from continuing operations excluding Libya, which was 401 mboed, 438 mboed and 408 mboed for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 . The table below provides additional detail regarding net sales volumes by segment: Net Sales Volumes 2016 Increase (Decrease) 2015 Increase (Decrease) 2014 North America E&P (mboed) 223 (17 )% 269 13 % 238 International E&P (mboed) 122 5 % 116 (9 )% 127 Oil Sands Mining (mbbld) (a) 59 11 % 53 6 % 50 Total Continuing Operations (mboed) 404 (8 )% 438 6 % 415 (a) Includes blendstocks. 32 North America E&P The following tables provide additional detail regarding net sales volumes, sales mix and operational drilling activity: Net Sales Volumes 2016 Increase (Decrease) 2015 Increase (Decrease) 2014 Oklahoma Resource Basins 35 40% 25 39% 18 Eagle Ford 105 (22)% 134 20% 112 Bakken 54 (8)% 59 16% 51 Other North America (a) 29 (43)% 51 (11)% 57 Total North America E&P (mboed) 223 (17)% 269 13% 238 (a) Year ended December 31, 2016 decreases relating to assets sold were 23 mboed, primarily consisting of Wyoming, West Texas, East Texas, North Louisiana and certain Gulf of Mexico assets. Sales Mix - U.S. Resource Plays - 2016 Oklahoma Resource Basins Eagle Ford Bakken Total Crude oil and condensate 25% 57% 81% 58% Natural gas liquids 26% 21% 11% 19% Natural gas 49% 22% 8% 23% Drilling Activity - U.S. Resource Plays 2016 2015 2014 Gross Operated Oklahoma Resource Basins: Wells drilled to total depth 33 20 19 Wells brought to sales 28 21 18 Eagle Ford: Wells drilled to total depth 168 251 360 Wells brought to sales 168 276 310 Bakken: Wells drilled to total depth 3 35 83 Wells brought to sales 13 56 69 In 2016, we continued to focus on our U.S. unconventional resource plays. We acquired 61,000 net surface acres in the STACK play in Oklahoma, delivered basin-leading well results in the Bakken and further improved returns in the Eagle Ford with cost reductions, efficiency gains and enhanced completions. North America E&P segment average net sales volumes in 2016 decrease d 17% when compared to 2015 largely as a result of the aforementioned dispositions in Wyoming, East Texas, North Louisiana and Gulf of Mexico, as well as base declines due to reduced completion activity. This decrease was partially offset by increases due to the Oklahoma STACK acquisition in the second-half of 2016. Oklahoma Resource Basins During 2016 we brought 28 gross wells to sales, of which 20 were in the STACK Meramec, 6 were in the SCOOP Woodford and 2 were in the SCOOP Springer . We increased activity during the year from two to five rigs, and focused on protecting our valuable acreage through leasehold drilling, delineation activity, and enhancing well performance through enhanced completion designs. We also pursued technical advancement through data collection, analysis and participation in several infill spacing pilots. In 2016, we drilled our first operated spacing pilot in the STACK Meramec and we expect those wells to come to sales in the first quarter of 2017. At year-end 2016, approximately 70% of our STACK leasehold was held by production and approximately 90% of our SCOOP acreage was held by production. Eagle Ford - In 2016 we brought 168 gross wells to sales, of which 90 were in the Lower Eagle Ford, 53 were in the Upper Eagle Ford, and 25 were in the Austin Chalk. We continued efforts to utilize technology and drive efficiencies into the drilling process resulting in an average spud-to-TD of 7.9 days in 2016, compared to 10.6 days in 2015. Record low average completed well costs of $3.9 million per well were achieved the fourth quarter of 2016 (down 20 percent from year-ago quarter), despite increasing proppant loading per lateral foot by more than 70 percent compared to fourth quarter 2015. Bakken In 2016 we brought 13 wells to sales, of which 7 were in the Middle Bakken formation and 6 were in the Three Forks formation. We realized well performance improvements through high intensity completions and targeted application of 33 diversion techniques. In 2016, Myrmidon wells were pumped with 6 to 18 million pounds of proppant with 40 to 50 stages per well. Since December, we have mobilized four rigs to Myrmidon to support the development program. North America E&P segment average net sales volumes in 2015 increased 13% when compared to 2014 . Net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes increased 24 mbbld and net natural gas sales volumes increased 41 mmcfd in 2015 primarily reflecting continued growth from our three core U.S. resource plays. International E&P The following table provides net sales volumes from continuing operations: Net Sales Volumes 2016 Increase (Decrease) 2015 Increase (Decrease) 2014 Equivalent Barrels (mboed) Equatorial Guinea 102 5% 97 (7)% 104 United Kingdom (a) 17 (11)% 19 19% 16 Libya 3 100% (100)% 7 Total International E&P (mboed) 122 5% 116 (9)% 127 Net Sales Volumes of Equity Method Investees LNG (mtd) 5,874 % 5,884 (10)% 6,535 Methanol (mtd) 1,358 45% 937 (14)% 1,092 Condensate & LPG (boed) 13,430 10% 12,208 (40)% 20,506 (a) Includes natural gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale of 5 mmcfd, 8 mmcfd and 6 mmcfd for 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 . International E&P segment average net sales volumes in 2016 increase d 5% when compared to 2015 . Sales volumes in E.G. were higher due to the completion and start-up of the Alba field compression project, which extends the production plateau and field life. In the U.K., the sales volumes slightly decreased as a result of downtime in the first quarter of 2016. International E&P segment average net sales volumes in 2015 decreased 9% when compared to 2014 . There were no liftings in Libya during 2015 as a result of ongoing civil unrest. Sales volumes in E.G. were lower due to a series of turnarounds and other maintenance activities performed at the Alba field, E.G. LNG and AMPCO facilities during the year. In the U.K., sales volumes increased as we completed the five-well Brae infill drilling program that began in 2014. Oil Sands Mining Our OSM operations consist of a 20% non-operated working interest in the AOSP. Our net synthetic crude oil sales volumes were 59 mbbld in 2016 compared to 53 mbbld in 2015 and 50 mbbld in 2014 . The 2016 increase was a result of strong mine and upgrader performance coupled with less planned maintenance. We've continued our alignment with the operator and other partners to focus on reducing the mine's cost and increasing reliability. As a result, there has been noticeable impact on the mine's cost structure with a 24% reduction in production expense to $27.89 per bbl for 2016 compared to 2015. See Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the 2016 compared to 2015 for additional detail on production expenses. 34 Market Conditions Oil and gas benchmarks declined during 2016 and as a result, we experienced declines in our price realizations associated with those benchmarks. Although we expect crude oil, natural gas and NGLs benchmark prices to remain volatile based on global supply and demand, prices have improved subsequent to December 31, 2016. See Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition Critical Accounting Estimates for further discussion of how a further decline in commodity prices could impact us. North America E&P The following table presents our average price realizations and the related benchmarks for crude oil, NGLs and natural gas for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 : 2016 Increase (Decrease) 2015 Decrease 2014 Average Price Realizations (a) Crude Oil and Condensate (per bbl) (b) $38.57 (11 )% $43.50 (49 )% 85.25 Natural Gas Liquids (per bbl) 13.15 (2 )% 13.37 (60 )% 33.42 Total Liquid Hydrocarbons (per bbl) 32.71 (14 )% 37.85 (51 )% 77.02 Natural Gas (per mcf) (c) 2.38 (11 )% 2.66 (42 )% 4.57 Benchmarks WTI crude oil average of daily prices (per bbl) $43.47 (11 )% $48.76 (48 )% 92.91 LLS crude oil average of daily prices (per bbl) 45.02 (14 )% 52.33 (46 )% 96.64 Mont Belvieu NGLs (per bbl) (d) 17.40 3 % 16.94 (48 )% 32.52 Henry Hub natural gas settlement date average (per mmbtu) 2.46 (8 )% 2.66 (40 )% 4.42 (a) Excludes gains or losses on commodity derivative instruments. (b) Inclusion of realized gains on crude oil derivative instruments would have increased average liquid hydrocarbon price realizations per barrel by $0.92 and $1.24 for 2016 and 2015 . There were no crude oil derivative instruments for 2014 . (c) Inclusion of realized gains (losses) on natural gas derivative instruments would have a de minimus impact on average price realizations for the periods presented. (d) Bloomberg Finance LLP: Y-grade Mix NGL of 50% ethane, 25% propane, 10% butane, 5% isobutane and 10% natural gasoline. Crude oil and condensate Our crude oil and condensate price realizations may differ from the benchmark due to the quality and location of the product. Natural gas liquids The majority of our NGLs volumes are sold at reference to Mont Belvieu prices. Natural gas A significant portion of our natural gas production in the U.S. is sold at bid-week prices, or first-of-month indices relative to our specific producing areas. International E&P The following table presents our average price realizations and the related benchmark for crude oil for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 : 2016 Decrease 2015 Increase (Decrease) 2014 Average Price Realizations Crude Oil and Condensate (per bbl) $41.70 (12 )% $47.50 (46 )% $87.23 Natural Gas Liquids (per bbl) 2.11 (25 )% 2.81 14 % 2.46 Total Liquid Hydrocarbons (per bbl) 32.10 (12 )% 36.67 (47 )% 68.98 Natural Gas (per mcf) 0.52 (24 )% 0.68 (6 )% 0.72 Benchmark Brent (Europe) crude oil (per bbl) (a) $43.55 (17 )% $52.35 (47 )% $99.02 (a) Average of monthly prices obtained from EIA website. Our U.K. liquid hydrocarbon production is generally sold in relation to the Brent crude benchmark. Our production from the Alba field in E.G. is condensate and gas. Condensate is sold at market prices. The Alba Plant extracts NGLs and secondary condensate from gas, leaving dry natural gas. The processed NGLs are sold by Alba Plant at market prices, with our share of its income/loss reflected in Income from equity method investments. The dry natural gas from Alba Plant is supplied to AMPCO and EGHoldings under long-term contracts at fixed prices; therefore, our reported average realized prices for NGLs and natural gas will not fully track market price movements. Because of the location and limited local demand for natural gas in E.G., we consider the prices under the contracts with Alba Plant LLC, EGHoldings and AMPCO to be comparable to the price that could 35 be realized from transactions with unrelated parties in this market under the same or similar circumstances. EGHoldings and AMPCO process the gas into LNG and methanol, which are sold at market prices, with our share of their income/loss reflected in the Income from equity method investments line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Although uncommon, any dry gas not sold is returned offshore and re-injected into the Alba field for later production. Oil Sands Mining The Oil Sands Mining segment produces and sells various qualities of synthetic crude oil. Output mix can be impacted by operational reliability or planned unit outages at the mines or upgrader. Sales prices for synthetic crude oil historically tracked movements in the WTI crude oil and the WCS Canadian heavy crude oil benchmarks. The influence of each benchmark can change from period to period based on market dynamics. The following table presents our average price realizations and the related benchmarks that impacted both our revenues and variable costs for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 : 2016 Decrease 2015 Decrease 2014 Average Price Realizations Synthetic Crude Oil (per bbl) $37.57 (6 %) $40.13 (52 %) $83.35 Benchmark WTI crude oil average of daily prices (per bbl) $43.47 (11 %) $48.76 (48 %) $92.91 WCS crude oil (per bbl) (a) 29.48 (16 %) 35.28 (52 %) 73.60 (a) Average of monthly prices based upon average WTI adjusted for differentials unique to western Canada. 36 Consolidated Results of Operations: 2016 compared to 2015 Sales and other operating revenues, including related party are summarized by segment in the following table: Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2016 2015 Sales and other operating revenues, including related party North America E&P $ 2,375 $ 3,358 International E&P 665 728 Oil Sands Mining 823 815 Segment sales and other operating revenues, including related party 3,863 4,901 Unrealized gain (loss) on commodity derivative instruments (110 ) 50 Sales and other operating revenues, including related party $ 3,753 $ 4,951 Below is a price/volume analysis for each segment. Refer to the preceding Operations and Market Conditions sections for additional detail related to our net sales volumes and average price realizations.

Marketing revenues decreased $293 million in 2016 from 2015 . Marketing activities include the purchase of commodities from third parties for resale and serve to aggregate volumes in order to satisfy transportation commitments as well as to achieve flexibility within product types and delivery points. Since the volume of marketing activity is based on market dynamics, it can fluctuate from period to period. The decreases are primarily related to lower marketed volumes in North America, which were further compounded by a lower commodity price environment. Income from equity method investments increased $30 million primarily due to higher net sales volumes in the second half of 2016 at E.G. as a result of the completion of the Alba field compression project. Additionally, a partial impairment of our investment in an equity method investee in 2015 of $12 million contributed to the increase in the current year. Net gain on disposal of assets increased $269 million in 2016 from 2015. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for information about these dispositions. Production expenses decreased $381 million in 2016 from 2015 . North America E&P declined $238 million primarily due to lower operational, maintenance and labor costs, coupled with lower net sales volumes resulting from the impact of our non-core asset dispositions and lower activity levels. International E&P declined $29 million largely due to lower operational and maintenance costs as well as a more favorable exchange rate on expenses. OSM decreased $114 million primarily due to continued lower turnaround costs, cost management, specifically staffing and contract labor, and a favorable exchange rate on expenses denominated in foreign currencies. 37 The 2016 production expense rate (expense per boe) for North America E&P declined primarily due to cost reductions that occurred at a rate faster than our production decline. The International E&P expense rate decreased in 2016 primarily due to reduced maintenance and project costs in the U.K. and benefited from the favorable exchange rate. The OSM expense rate decreased in 2016 primarily due to lower operational costs and the favorable exchange rate. The following table provides production expense rates for each segment: ($ per boe) 2016 2015 North America E&P $5.96 $7.38 International E&P $5.05 $5.99 Oil Sands Mining (a) $27.89 $36.48 (a) Production expense per synthetic crude oil barrel (before royalties) includes production costs, shipping and handling, taxes other than income and insurance costs and excludes pre-development costs. Marketing expenses decreased $287 million in 2016 from the prior year, consistent with the decrease in marketing revenues discussed above. Other operating expenses increased $73 million primarily as a result of the termination payment of our Gulf of Mexico deepwater drilling rig. Exploration expenses decreased $988 million in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting our strategic decision to transition out of conventional exploration. In 2016, unproved property impairments primarily consisted of non-cash charges related to our decision to not drill our remaining Gulf of Mexico leases and also included certain other unproved properties in North America. In 2015, unproved property impairments are due to changes in our conventional exploration strategy (Gulf of Mexico, Canadian in-situ assets and Harir block in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq), and the sale of certain properties in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as our unproved property in Colorado. Dry well costs in 2015 included the operated Solomon exploration well in the Gulf of Mexico, our operated Sodalita West #1 exploratory well in E.G., and suspended well costs related to our Canadian in-situ assets at Birchwood. The following table summarizes the components of exploration expenses: Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2016 2015 Unproved property impairments $ 195 $ 964 Dry well costs 32 250 Geological and geophysical 5 31 Other 98 73 Total exploration expenses $ 330 $ 1,318 Exploration expenses are also discussed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. Depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased $562 million in 2016 from the prior year primarily as a result of net sales volume decreases in the North America E&P segment, including the impact of non-core asset dispositions, and volume declines due to base declines and lower completion activity. Our segments apply the units-of-production method to the majority of their assets, including capitalized asset retirement costs; therefore, volumes have an impact on DD&A expense. The DD&A rate (expense per boe), which is impacted by field-level changes in sales volumes, reserves and capitalized costs, can also cause changes to our DD&A. The following table provides DD&A rates for each segment. The DD&A rate for North America E&P decreased primarily due to a higher proved reserve base. The DD&A rate for International E&P declined primarily due to sales volume mix changes in E.G. and the U.K. for 2016. ($ per boe) 2016 2015 North America E&P $22.49 $24.24 International E&P $6.21 $6.95 Oil Sands Mining $11.32 $12.48 Impairments decreased $685 million in 2016 versus 2015. Impairments in 2016 were primarily the result of lower forecasted commodity prices in conventional properties in Oklahoma and the Gulf of Mexico, and were also the result of revisions to estimated abandonment costs. Impairments in 2015 included $340 million for the goodwill impairment of the North America E&P reporting unit, and $335 million related to proved properties (primarily in Colorado and the Gulf of Mexico) as a result of lower forecasted commodity prices, and $44 million associated with our disposition of natural gas assets in East Texas, North Louisiana and Wilburton, Oklahoma. 38 See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 13 and Note 14 to the consolidated financial statement for additional detail. Taxes other than income includes production, severance and ad valorem taxes, primarily in the U.S., which tend to increase or decrease in relation to revenue and sales volumes. The decline in revenue and sales volumes during 2016 resulted in a decline of $66 million compared to 2015. The following table summarizes the components of taxes other than income: Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2016 2015 Production and severance $ 91 $ 131 Ad valorem 23 39 Other 54 64 Total $ 168 $ 234 General and administrative expenses decreased $106 million primarily due to cost savings realized from the 2015 workforce reductions including corresponding severance expenses. Net interest and other increased $68 million primarily due to an increase in interest expense as a result of the increase in long-term debt in the second quarter of 2015. The components of net interest and other are detailed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. Provision (benefit) for income taxes reflects an effective tax rate of 73% and (25)% for 2016 and 2015 . The increase of the 2016 effective tax rate was primarily due to the valuation allowance increase of $1,346 million related to U.S. benefits on foreign taxes and other federal deferred tax assets. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the effective income tax rate. Segment Results: 2016 compared to 2015 Segment income (loss) for 2016 and 2015 is summarized and reconciled to net income (loss) in the following table. Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2016 2015 North America E&P $ (415 ) $ (486 ) International E&P 228 112 Oil Sands Mining (55 ) (113 ) Segment income (loss) (242 ) (487 ) Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes (1,898 ) (1,717 ) Net income (loss) $ (2,140 ) $ (2,204 ) North America E&P segment loss decreased $71 million in 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of lower net sales volumes and their impact to DD&A, production costs and taxes other than income which was nearly offset by lower revenues as a result of decreases in both price realizations and net sales volumes. The remainder of the decrease was due to lower exploration expenses in 2016 relative to 2015. International E&P segment income increased $116 million in 2016 compared to 2015 . The increase was largely due to lower exploration expenses in 2016, as our 2015 expense included costs relating to our transition out of our conventional exploration program. The remainder of the increase was due to lower production costs and DD&A as a result of lower asset retirement costs and sales mix, and an increase in income from equity method investments, partially offset by lower price realizations. Oil Sands Mining segment loss decreased $58 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to higher sales volumes and lower production expenses, which were partially offset by lower price realizations. 39 Consolidated Results of Operations: 2015 compared to 2014 Sales and other operating revenues, including related party are summarized by segment in the following table: Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2015 2014 Sales and other operating revenues, including related party North America E&P $ 3,358 $ 5,770 International E&P 728 1,410 Oil Sands Mining 815 1,556 Segment sales and other operating revenues, including related party 4,901 8,736 Unrealized gain on crude oil derivative instruments 50 Sales and other operating revenues, including related party $ 4,951 $ 8,736 Below is a price/volume analysis for each segment. Refer to the preceding Operations and Market Conditions sections for additional detail related to our net sales volumes and average price realizations. Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) Related to Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2014 Price Realizations Net Sales Volumes 2015 North America E&P Price-Volume Analysis Liquid hydrocarbons $ 5,240 $ (3,006 ) $ 671 $ 2,905 Natural gas 516 (243 ) 68 341 Realized gain on crude oil derivative instruments 78 78 Other sales 14 34 Total $ 5,770 $ 3,358 International E&P Price-Volume Analysis Liquid hydrocarbons $ 1,240 $ (509 ) $ (153 ) $ 578 Natural gas 124 (8 ) (8 ) 108 Other sales 46 42 Total $ 1,410 $ 728 Oil Sands Mining Price-Volume Analysis Synthetic crude oil $ 1,525 $ (842 ) $ 98 $ 781 Other sales 31 34 Total $ 1,556 $ 815 Marketing revenues decreased $1,539 million in 2015 from 2014 . Marketing activities include the purchase of commodities from third parties for resale and serve to aggregate volumes in order to satisfy transportation commitments as well as to achieve flexibility within product types and delivery points. Since the volume of marketing activity is based on market dynamics, it can fluctuate from period to period. The decreases are primarily related to the lower commodity price environment as well as lower marketed volumes in North America. Income from equity method investments decreased $279 million primarily due to lower price realizations for LPG at our Alba Plant, LNG at our LNG facility and lower methanol prices at our AMPCO methanol facility, all of which are located in E.G. Also contributing to the decrease were lower sales volumes due to planned turnaround and maintenance activities at the AMPCO methanol plant, the Alba field and the LNG facility. Net gain on disposal of assets in 2015 was related to the sale of our operated producing properties in the greater Ewing Bank area and non-operated producing interests in the Petronius field in the Gulf of Mexico. The gain associated with those assets was partially offset by the loss on sale of East Africa exploration acreage in Ethiopia and Kenya. The net loss on disposal of assets in 2014 was primarily related to the sale of non-core acreage located in the far northwest portion of the Williston Basin. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for information about these dispositions. Production expenses decreased $552 million in 2015 from 2014 . Our focus on cost discipline and efficiencies yielded sustainable savings in production costs. North America E&P declined $167 million due to lower operational, maintenance and labor costs. International E&P declined $131 million due to lower project work, repair, maintenance and turnaround costs, as 40 well as lower production volumes. OSM declined $254 million primarily due to cost management, especially staffing and contract labor, lower fuel and utility costs, and lower feedstock purchases given the increased mine and upgrader reliability, combined with a more favorable exchange rate on expenses denominated in the Canadian dollar. The production expense rate (expense rate per boe) decreased for each of our segments as total production costs declined due to reasons described in the preceding paragraph. The North America E&P and OSM segments also experienced volume increases, which further contributed to the expense rate decline. The following table provides production expense rates for each segment: ($ per boe) 2015 2014 North America E&P $7.38 $10.25 International E&P $5.99 $8.31 Oil Sands Mining (a) $36.48 $44.53 (a) Production expense per synthetic crude oil barrel (before royalties) includes production costs, shipping and handling, taxes other than income and insurance costs and excludes pre-development costs. Marketing expenses decreased $1,536 million in 2015 from the prior year, consistent with the decreases in marketing revenues discussed above. Exploration expenses increased $525 million in 2015 , primarily due to higher unproved property impairments in North America. During 2015, we made a strategic decision to reduce the overall level of our conventional exploration program; as a result, we impaired our Canadian in-situ assets, certain of our leases in the Gulf of Mexico and the Harir block in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. We also impaired unproved property in Colorado in 2015, which we deemed uneconomic given our forecasted natural gas prices. Unproved property impairments in 2014 primarily were a result of Eagle Ford and Bakken leases that either expired or we decided not to drill or extend. Dry well costs for 2015 include the operated Solomon well in the Gulf of Mexico, our operated Sodalita West #1 exploratory well in E.G., and suspended well costs related to our Canadian in-situ assets at Birchwood. Dry well costs in 2014 also included our operated Sodalita West #1 exploratory well in E.G. which was drilling over year-end 2014 , the operated Key Largo well, outside-operated Perseus well and the outside operated second Shenandoah appraisal well, all of which are located in the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, 2014 also includes our exploration programs in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, Ethiopia and Kenya. The following table summarizes the components of exploration expenses: Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2015 2014 Unproved property impairments $ 964 $ 306 Dry well costs 250 317 Geological and geophysical 31 85 Other 73 85 Total exploration expenses $ 1,318 $ 793 Exploration expense are also discussed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $96 million in 2015 from the prior year primarily as a result of higher North America E&P net sales volumes from our three U.S. resource plays. Our segments apply the units-of-production method to the majority of their assets, including capitalized asset retirement costs; therefore, proved reserve and production volumes have an impact on DD&A expense. The DD&A rate (expense rate per boe), which is impacted by changes in proved reserves, capitalized costs and sales volume mix by field, can also cause changes to our DD&A. The following table provides DD&A rates for each segment. The DD&A rate for North America E&P decreased primarily as a result of a higher proved reserve base in the Eagle Ford. The International E&P rate increased primarily due to higher sales volumes from the Brae infill drilling program. ($ per boe) 2015 2014 North America E&P $24.24 $26.95 International E&P $6.95 $5.79 Oil Sands Mining $12.48 $12.07 41 Impairments for 2015 included $340 million for the goodwill impairment of the North America E&P reporting unit, $335 million related to proved properties (primarily in Colorado and the Gulf of Mexico) as a result of lower forecasted commodity prices and $44 million associated with our disposition of natural gas assets in East Texas, North Louisiana and Wilburton, Oklahoma. Impairments for 2014 consisted primarily of proved properties in the Gulf of Mexico, Texas and North Dakota as a result of revisions to estimated abandonment costs and lower forecasted commodity prices. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 13 and Note 14 to the consolidated financial statement for additional detail. Taxes other than income include production, severance and ad valorem taxes, primarily in the U.S., which tend to increase or decrease in relation to revenues and sales volumes. With the decrease in North America E&P revenues due to lower price realizations, taxes other than income decreased $172 million in 2015 . This decrease was partially offset by an increase in sales volumes in North America E&P. The following table summarizes the components of taxes other than income: Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2015 2014 Production and severance $ 131 $ 240 Ad valorem 39 74 Other 64 92 Total $ 234 $ 406 General and administrative expenses decreased $64 million primarily due to cost savings realized from the workforce reductions that occurred during 2015 . This decrease was partially offset by severance expenses of $55 million associated with the workforce reductions and an increase in pension settlement expense. Pension settlement expenses in 2015 totaled $119 million as compared to $99 million in 2014 . Net interest and other increased $29 million primarily due to increased interest expense associated with an increase in long-term debt. The components of net interest and other are detailed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. Provision (benefit) for income taxes reflects an effective tax rate of (25)% and 29% for each of 2015 and 2014 . See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the effective income tax rate. Discontinued operations is presented net of tax. We closed the sale of our Angola assets and Norway business in 2014 , and both are reflected as discontinued operations for 2014 . Included in the discontinued operations for 2014 are after-tax gains of $532 million and $976 million related to the dispositions of Angola and Norway respectively. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. Segment Results: 2015 compared to 2014 Segment income (loss) for 2015 and 2014 is summarized and reconciled to net income (loss) in the following table. Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2015 2014 North America E&P $ (486 ) $ 693 International E&P 112 568 Oil Sands Mining (113 ) 235 Segment income (loss) (487 ) 1,496 Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes $ (1,717 ) (527 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations (2,204 ) 969 Discontinued operations 2,077 Net income (loss) $ (2,204 ) $ 3,046 North America E&P segment income (loss) decreased $1,179 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease was primarily due to lower price realizations, which was partially offset by the impacts from the increased net sales volumes from the three U.S resource plays and lower production costs (even though net sales volumes increased). International E&P segment income decreased $456 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease was largely due to lower liquid hydrocarbon price realizations as well as reduced income from equity investments. These declines were partially offset by lower production, operating and exploration expenses. Oil Sands Mining segment income (loss) decreased $348 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily as result of lower price realizations, partially offset by higher sales volumes and reduced production expenses. 42 Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, Cash Flows and Liquidity Commodity prices are the most significant factor impacting our operating cash flows and the amount of capital available to reinvest into the business. In 2016, we closed on the sale of certain non-core assets resulting in net proceeds of $ 1.2 billion , including closing adjustments, which allowed us to be opportunistic with a high quality acquisition in Oklahoma's STACK play. Our successful portfolio management allowed us to realize our goal of living within cash flows in 2016. Beyond the proceeds the non-core asset sales generated, the portfolio changes enhance our profitability by driving out higher unit cost operations and allowing for the more efficient allocation of our Capital Program to the high return opportunities in the U.S. resource plays. We plan to continue the progress we made in 2016 towards achieving profitable growth within cash flows as the price environment improves. Steps taken to respond to the sustained low commodity prices during 2016 included the following strategic actions: Divested of certain non-core assets resulting in net proceeds of $ 1.2 billion Raised proceeds of $1.2 billion from an equity offering in the first quarter of 2016 Reduced cash additions to property, plant and equipment to $1.2 billion , a 64% decrease compared to 2015 Expanded the capacity of the revolving credit facility from $3.0 billion to $3.3 billion in the first quarter of 2016 Improved cost structure by reducing total company production expenses by 23% and production expense per boe in 2016 by: North America E&P - 19% reduction to $5.96 per boe International E&P - 16% reduction to $5.05 per boe Oil Sands Mining - 24% reduction to $27.89 per boe Increased cash and cash equivalents by $1.3 billion from year-end 2015 Progressed our 2017 commodity hedging program which covers approximately 40% of our expected U.S. crude oil and natural gas production. Pricing for these hedges is discussed in further detail in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements At December 31, 2016 , we had approximately $5.8 billion of liquidity consisting of $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $3.3 billion available under our revolving credit facility. As previously discussed in Outlook, we are targeting a $2.2 billion Capital Program for 2017. We believe our current liquidity level and balance sheet, along with our non-core asset disposition program and ability to access the capital markets provides us with the flexibility to fund our business throughout the sustained lower commodity price cycle. We will continue to evaluate the commodity price environment and our spending throughout 2017. 43 Cash Flows The following table presents sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 : Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2016 2015 2014 Sources of cash and cash equivalents Continuing operations $ 1,073 $ 1,565 $ 4,736 Discontinued operations 751 Disposals of assets 1,219 225 3,760 Issuance of common stock 1,236 Maturities of short-term investment 925 Borrowings, net 1,996 Other 56 91 214 Total sources of cash and cash equivalents $ 3,584 $ 4,802 $ 9,461 Uses of cash and cash equivalents Cash additions to property, plant and equipment $ (1,245 ) $ (3,476 ) $ (5,160 ) Purchases of short-term investments (925 ) Investing activities of discontinued operations (376 ) Acquisitions (902 ) (21 ) Purchases of common stock (1,000 ) Commercial paper, net (135 ) Debt repayments (1 ) (1,069 ) (68 ) Debt issuance costs (19 ) Dividends paid (162 ) (460 ) (543 ) Other (5 ) (30 ) (24 ) Total uses of cash and cash equivalents $ (2,315 ) $ (5,979 ) $ (7,327 ) Cash flows from continuing operations in 2016 were lower than 2015 as the downturn in commodity prices continued to impact price realizations coupled with lower net sales volumes which negatively impact our cash flows from operating activities. In 2016, our weighted average crude oil and natural gas price realizations were down 11% and 16% as compared to the prior year. Proceeds from disposals of assets in 2016 are primarily from the sale of our Wyoming upstream and midstream assets, as well as the sale of certain other assets in West Texas and New Mexico. Disposals of assets in 2015 pertain to the sale of certain of our operated and non-operated producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico as well as natural gas assets in East Texas, North Louisiana and Wilburton, Oklahoma. Disposals in 2014 primarily reflect the proceeds from the sales of our Angola assets and our Norway business. Disposition transactions are discussed in further detail in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. Issuance of common stock reflects net proceeds received in March 2016. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Cash flows from discontinued operations primarily related to our Norway business, which we disposed of in fourth quarter 2014. Borrowings reflect net proceeds received from the issuance of senior notes in June 2015. In November 2015, we repaid our $1 billion 0.90% senior notes upon maturity. We announced an adjustment to our quarterly dividend starting in third quarter 2015, with the full-year impact resulting in a decrease of dividends paid in the current year. During the third quarter of 2016, we closed the Oklahoma STACK acquisition for a purchase price of $902 million, net of cash acquired; see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information concerning acquisitions. 44 Additions to property, plant and equipment are our most significant use of cash and cash equivalents. The following table shows capital expenditures related to continuing operations by segment and reconciles to additions to property, plant and equipment as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 : Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2016 2015 2014 North America E&P $ 936 $ 2,553 $ 4,698 International E&P 82 368 534 Oil Sands Mining (a) 33 (10 ) 212 Corporate 18 25 51 Total capital expenditures 1,069 2,936 5,495 Change in capital expenditure accrual 176 540 (335 ) Additions to property, plant and equipment $ 1,245 $ 3,476 $ 5,160 (a) Reflects reimbursements earned from the governments of Canada and Alberta related to funds previously expended for Quest CCS capital equipment. Quest CCS was successfully completed and commissioned in the fourth quarter of 2015. There were no share repurchases in 2016 or 2015. During 2014, we acquired 29 million shares at a cost of $1 billion. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of purchases of common stock. Liquidity and Capital Resources In March 2016, we issued 166,750,000 shares of our common stock, par value $1 per share, at a price of $7.65 per share, excluding underwriting discounts and commissions, for net proceeds of $1,236 million . The proceeds were used to strengthen our balance sheet and for general corporate purposes, including funding a portion of our Capital Program. Also in March 2016, we increased our $3 billion unsecured revolving credit facility by $300 million to a total of $3.3 billion. Fees on the unused commitment of each lender, as well as the borrowing options under the revolving credit facility, remain unaffected by the increase. Our main sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, internally generated cash flow from operations, sales of non-core assets, capital market transactions, and our $3.3 billion revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2016 , we had approximately $5.8 billion of liquidity consisting of $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $3.3 billion available under our revolving credit facility. Our working capital requirements are supported by these sources and we may draw on our $3.3 billion revolving credit facility to meet short-term cash requirements, or issue debt or equity securities through the shelf registration statement discussed below as part of our longer-term liquidity and capital management. Because of the alternatives available to us as discussed above, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity are adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements including our capital spending programs, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities, and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies. Due to decreases in crude oil and U.S. natural gas prices, credit rating agencies reviewed companies in the industry earlier this year. During the first quarter of 2016, our corporate credit rating was downgraded by: Standard & Poor's Ratings Services to BBB- (stable) from BBB (stable); by Fitch Ratings to BBB (negative) from BBB+ (stable); and by Moody's Investor Services, Inc. to Ba1 (negative) from Baa1 (stable). On October 11, 2016, Moody Investor Services, Inc. subsequently revised their outlook of our corporate credit rating to stable from negative. Any further rating downgrades could increase our future cost of financing or limit our ability to access capital, and result in additional collateral requirements. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of how a further downgrade in our credit ratings could affect us. We may incur additional debt in order to fund our capital expenditures, acquisitions or development activities, or for general corporate or other purposes. A higher level of indebtedness could increase the risk that our liquidity and financial flexibility deteriorates. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a further discussion of how our level of indebtedness could affect us. The June 23, 2016 referendum by British voters to exit the European Union ( Brexit ) provided volatility around European currencies and resulted in a decline in the value of the British pound, as compared to the U.S. dollar and other currencies. For our U.K. operations, a majority of our revenues are tied to global crude oil prices which are denominated in U.S. dollars while a significant portion of our operating and capital costs are denominated in British pounds. In addition, our U.K. operations have an asset retirement obligation, which represents a future cash commitment. In the longer term, any impact from Brexit on our U.K. operations will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory, and other negotiations. 45 Capital Resources Credit Arrangements and Borrowings At December 31, 2016 , we had no borrowings against our revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2016 , we had $7.3 billion in long-term debt outstanding, with our next debt maturity in the amount of $ 682 million due in the fourth quarter of 2017. We do not have any triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an event of default in the case of a downgrade of our credit ratings. Shelf Registration We have a universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC, under which we, as a "well-known seasoned issuer" for purposes of SEC rules, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities. Asset Disposals We have closed or announced $1.3 billion of non-core asset sales during 2016. In the largest transaction, we announced the sale of our Wyoming upstream and midstream assets and received proceeds of approximately $845 million. We also entered into multiple agreements to sell certain non-operated assets, and CO2 and waterflood assets in West Texas and New Mexico for combined proceeds of approximately $302 million. Additionally, we entered into separate agreements to sell our 10% working interest in the outside-operated Shenandoah discovery in the Gulf of Mexico, operated natural gas assets in the Piceance basin in Colorado and certain undeveloped acreage in West Texas for a combined total of approximately $80 million in proceeds. We closed on certain of these asset sales in 2016, with the remaining asset sales expected to close in the second quarter of 2017. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these dispositions. Cash-Adjusted Debt-To-Capital Ratio Our cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio (total debt-minus-cash to total debt-plus-equity-minus-cash) was 21% at December 31, 2016 and 25% at December 31, 2015 . (Dollars in millions) 2016 2015 Long-term debt due within one year $ 686 $ 1 Long-term debt 6,589 7,276 Total debt $ 7,275 $ 7,277 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,490 $ 1,221 Equity $ 17,541 $ 18,553 Calculation Total debt $ 7,275 $ 7,277 Minus cash and cash equivalents 2,490 1,221 Total debt minus cash and cash equivalents 4,785 6,056 Total debt $ 7,275 $ 7,277 Plus equity 17,541 18,553 Minus cash and cash equivalents 2,490 1,221 Total debt plus equity minus cash, cash equivalents $ 22,326 $ 24,609 Cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio 21 % 25 % Capital Requirements Capital Spending Our approved Capital Program for 2017 is $2.2 billion . Additional details were previously discussed in Outlook. Share Repurchase Program The remaining share repurchase authorization as of December 31, 2016 is $1.5 billion. 46 Other Expected Cash Outflows On January 25, 2017, our Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.05 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016. The dividend is payable on March 10, 2017 to shareholders on record on February 15, 2017. We plan to make contributions of up to $60 million to our funded pension plans during 2017 . Cash contributions to be paid from our general assets for the unfunded pension and postretirement plans are expected to be approximately $5 million and $21 million in 2017 . Contractual Cash Obligations The table below provides aggregated information on our consolidated obligations to make future payments under existing contracts as of December 31, 2016 . (In millions) Total 2017 2018- 2019 2020- 2021 Later Years Short and long-term debt (includes interest) (a) $ 11,318 $ 1,042 $ 1,654 $ 1,102 $ 7,520 Lease obligations 183 36 58 55 34 Purchase obligations: Oil and gas activities (b) 151 128 14 7 2 Service and materials contracts (c) 764 78 93 28 565 Transportation and related contracts 1,606 256 483 261 606 Drilling rigs and fracturing crews (d) 44 44 Other 126 20 32 22 52 Total purchase obligations 2,691 526 622 318 1,225 Other long-term liabilities reported in the consolidated balance sheet (e) 370 51 69 69 181 Total contractual cash obligations (f) $ 14,562 $ 1,655 $ 2,403 $ 1,544 $ 8,960 (a) Includes anticipated cash payments for interest of $359 million for 2017 , $572 million for 2018 - 2019 , $502 million for 2020 - 2021 and $2,585 million for the remaining years for a total of $4,018 million . (b) Oil and gas activities include contracts to acquire property, plant and equipment and commitments for oil and gas exploration such as costs related to contractually obligated exploratory work programs that are expensed immediately. (c) Service and materials contracts include contracts to purchase services such as utilities, supplies and various other maintenance and operating services. (d) Some contracts may be canceled at an amount less than the contract amount. Were we to elect that option where possible at December 31, 2016 our minimum commitment would be $42 million . (e) Primarily includes obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits including medical and life insurance. We have estimated projected funding requirements through 2026. Although unrecognized tax benefits are not a contractual obligation, they are presented in this table because they represent potential demands on our liquidity. (f) This table does not include the estimated discounted liability for dismantlement, abandonment and restoration costs of oil and gas properties of $1,748 million . See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements. Transactions with Related Parties We own a 63% working interest in the Alba field offshore E.G. Onshore E.G., we own a 52% interest in an LPG processing plant, a 60% interest in an LNG production facility and a 45% interest in a methanol production plant, each through equity method investees. We sell our natural gas from the Alba field to these equity method investees as the feedstock for their production processes. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Off-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Although off-balance sheet arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes, we are not dependent on these arrangements to maintain our liquidity and capital resources, and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the off-balance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources. We will issue stand-alone letters of credit when required by a business partner. Such letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 aggregated $166 million , $53 million and $101 million . Most of the letters of credit are in support of obligations recorded in the consolidated balance sheet. For example, they are issued to counterparties to insure our payments for outstanding company debt and future abandonment liabilities. 47 Management Discussion and Analysis of Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies We have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes. Legislation and regulations pertaining to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions have the potential to materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including costs of compliance and permitting delays. The extent and magnitude of these adverse impacts cannot be reliably or accurately estimated at this time because specific regulatory and legislative requirements have not been finalized and uncertainty exists with respect to the measures being considered, the costs and the time frames for compliance, and our ability to pass compliance costs on to our customers. For additional information see Item 1A. Risk Factors. We accrue for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated. As environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise, charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required. New or expanded environmental requirements, which could increase our environmental costs, may arise in the future. We strive to comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment, but as not all costs are fixed or presently determinable (even under existing legislation) and may be affected by future legislation or regulations, it is not possible to predict all of the ultimate costs of compliance, including remediation costs that may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed. For more information on environmental regulations that impact us, or could impact us, see Item 1. Business Environmental, Health and Safety Matters, Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 3. Legal Proceedings. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods. Accounting estimates are considered to be critical if (1) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and (2) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. Estimated Quantities of Net Reserves We use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities. The successful efforts method inherently relies on the estimation of proved crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves. The amount of estimated proved reserve volumes affect, among other things, whether certain costs are capitalized or expensed, the amount and timing of costs depreciated, depleted or amortized into net income and the presentation of supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities. In addition, the expected future cash flows to be generated by producing properties are used for testing impairment and the expected future taxable income available to realize deferred tax assets, also in part, rely on estimates of quantities of net reserves. Refer to the applicable sections below for further discussion of these accounting estimates. The estimation of quantities of net reserves is a highly technical process performed by our engineers and geoscientists for crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas, and synthetic crude oil, which is based upon several underlying assumptions. The reserve estimates may change as additional information becomes available and as contractual, operational, economic and political conditions change. We evaluate our reserves using drilling results, reservoir performance, seismic interpretation and future plans to develop acreage. Technologies used in proved reserves estimation includes statistical analysis of production performance, decline curve analysis, pressure and rate transient analysis, pressure gradient analysis, reservoir simulation and volumetric analysis. The observed statistical nature of production performance coupled with highly certain reservoir continuity or quality within the reliable technology areas and sufficient proved developed locations establish the reasonable certainty criteria required for booking proved reserves. The data for a given reservoir may also change over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. 48 Reserve estimates are based on an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices during the 12-month period, using the closing prices on the first day of each month, as defined by the SEC. The table below provides the 2016 SEC pricing for certain benchmark prices: SEC Pricing 2016 WTI Crude oil (per bbl) $ 42.75 Henry Hub natural gas (per mmbtu) $ 2.49 Brent crude oil (per bbl) $ 43.53 Mont Belvieu NGLs (per bbl) $ 15.89 When determining the December 31, 2016 proved reserves for each property, the benchmark prices listed above were adjusted using price differentials that account for property-specific quality and location differences. Estimates of future cash flows associated with proved reserves are based on actual costs of developing and producing proved reserves at the end of the year. If commodity prices were to significantly drop below average prices used to estimate 2016 proved reserves (see table above), we would expect price related reserve revisions that could have a material impact on proved reserve volumes and the present value of our proved reserves. In this scenario, our OSM proved reserves represent the largest risk to be reclassified to non-proved reserves or resource category. For further discussion of risks associated with our estimation of proved reserves, see Part I. Item 1A Risk Factors. Depreciation and depletion of crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil producing properties is determined by the units-of-production method and could change with revisions to estimated proved reserves. While revisions of previous reserve estimates have not historically been significant to the depreciation and depletion rates of our segments, any reduction in proved reserves, could result in an acceleration of future DD&A expense. The following table illustrates, on average, the sensitivity of each segment's units-of-production DD&A per boe and pretax income to a hypothetical 10% change in 2016 proved reserves based on 2016 production. Impact of a 10% Increase in Proved Reserves Impact of a 10% Decrease in Proved Reserves (In millions, except per boe) DD&A per boe Pretax Income DD&A per boe Pretax Income North America E&P $ (2.04 ) $ 167 $ 2.50 $ (204 ) International E&P $ (0.56 ) $ 25 $ 0.69 $ (31 ) Oil Sands Mining $ (0.99 ) $ 18 $ 1.26 $ (22 ) Asset Retirement Obligations We have material legal, regulatory and contractual obligations to remove and dismantle long-lived assets and to restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations, including bitumen mining operations. A liability equal to the fair value of such obligations and a corresponding capitalized asset retirement cost are recognized on the balance sheet in the period in which the legal obligation is incurred and a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The capitalized asset retirement cost is depreciated using the units-of-production method and the discounted liability is accreted over the period until the obligation is satisfied, the impacts of which are recognized as DD&A in the consolidated statements of income. In many cases, the satisfaction and subsequent discharge of these liabilities is projected to occur many years, or even decades, into the future. Furthermore, the legal, regulatory and contractual requirements often do not provide specific guidance regarding removal practices and the criteria that must be fulfilled when the removal and/or restoration event actually occurs. Estimates of retirement costs are developed for each property based on numerous factors, such as the scope of the dismantlement, timing of settlement, interpretation of legal, regulatory and contractual requirements, type of production and processing structures, depth of water (if applicable), reservoir characteristics, depth of the reservoir, market demand for equipment, currently available dismantlement and restoration procedures and consultations with construction and engineering professionals. Inflation rates and credit-adjusted-risk-free interest rates are then applied to estimate the fair values of the obligations. To the extent these or other assumptions change after initial recognition of the liability, the fair value estimate is revised and the recognized liability adjusted, with a corresponding adjustment made to the related asset balance or income statement, as appropriate. Changes in estimated asset retirement obligations for late life assets could result in future impairment charges. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures regarding our asset retirement obligation estimates. An estimate of the sensitivity to net income if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practical because of the number of obligations that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of possible assumptions. 49 Fair Value Estimates Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. There are three approaches for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities: the market approach, the income approach and the cost approach, each of which includes multiple valuation techniques. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach uses valuation techniques to measure fair value by converting future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, into a single present value, or range of present values, using current market expectations about those future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace the service capacity of an asset. This is often referred to as current replacement cost. The cost approach assumes that the fair value would not exceed what it would cost a market participant to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility, adjusted for obsolescence. The fair value accounting standards do not prescribe which valuation technique should be used when measuring fair value and do not prioritize among the techniques. These standards establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in applying the various valuation techniques. Inputs broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make pricing decisions, including assumptions about risk. Level 1 inputs are given the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy while Level 3 inputs are given the lowest priority. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: Level 1 Observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets as of the measurement date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 2 Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. These are inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date. Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data and may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management best estimate of fair value. Valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs are favored. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest priority level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities within the levels of the fair value hierarchy. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures regarding our fair value measurements. Significant uses of fair value measurements include: impairment assessments of long-lived assets; impairment assessments of goodwill; and recorded value of derivative instruments. The need to test long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment can be based on several indicators, including a significant reduction in prices of crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas or synthetic crude oil, sustained declines in our common stock, reductions to our Capital Program, unfavorable adjustments to reserves, significant changes in the expected timing of production, other changes to contracts or changes in the regulatory environment in which the property is located. Impairment Assessments of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets in use are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. For purposes of an impairment evaluation, long-lived assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified, which generally is field-by-field or, in certain instances, by logical grouping of assets if there is significant shared infrastructure or contractual terms that cause economic interdependency amongst separate, discrete fields. If the sum of the undiscounted estimated cash flows from the use of the asset group and its eventual disposition is less than the carrying value of an asset group, the carrying value is written down to the estimated fair value. During 2016 the sustained decline of commodity prices resulted in a downward revisions of our long-term commodity price assumptions which triggered an assessment of certain of our long-lived assets related to oil and gas producing properties for impairment. We estimated the fair values using an income approach and recognized impairments. As of the date of our last impairment assessment, our estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to our long-lived assets significantly exceeded their carrying values. Long-lived assets most at risk for future impairment (defined as those assets with estimated undiscounted cash flows that exceeded their carrying values by less than approximately 50%) had estimated undiscounted cash flows that exceeded their $269 million carrying value by $139 million. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 13 and Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of impairments recorded in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 and the related fair value measurements. 50 Fair value calculated for the purpose of testing our long-lived assets for impairment is estimated using the present value of expected future cash flows method and comparative market prices when appropriate. Significant judgment is involved in performing these fair value estimates since the results are based on forecasted assumptions. Significant assumptions include: Future crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil prices. Our estimates of future prices are based on our analysis of market supply and demand and consideration of market price indicators. Although these commodity prices may experience extreme volatility in any given year, we believe long-term industry prices are driven by global market supply and demand. To estimate supply, we consider numerous factors, including the worldwide resource base, depletion rates and OPEC production policies. We believe demand is largely driven by global economic factors, such as population and income growth, governmental policies and vehicle stocks. The prices we use in our fair value estimates are consistent with those used in our planning and capital investment reviews. There has been significant volatility in crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil prices and estimates of such future prices are inherently imprecise. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion on commodity prices. Estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil. Such quantities are based on a combination of proved reserves and risk-weighted probable reserves and resources such that the combined volumes represent the most likely expectation of recovery. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion on reserves. Expected timing of production. Production forecasts are the outcome of engineer studies which estimate reserves, as well as expected capital development programs. The actual timing of the production could be different than the projection. Cash flows realized later in the projection period are less valuable than those realized earlier due to the time value of money. The expected timing of production that we use in our fair value estimates is consistent with that used in our planning and capital investment reviews. Discount rate commensurate with the risks involved. We apply a discount rate to our expected cash flows based on a variety of factors, including market and economic conditions, operational risk, regulatory risk and political risk. A higher discount rate decreases the net present value of cash flows. Future capital requirements. Our estimates of future capital requirements are based upon a combination of authorized spending and internal forecasts. We base our fair value estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonably likely to occur. An estimate of the sensitivity to changes in assumptions in our undiscounted cash flow calculations is not practicable, given the numerous assumptions (e.g. reserves, pace and timing of development plans, commodity prices, capital expenditures, operating costs, drilling and development costs, inflation and discount rates) that can materially affect our estimates. Unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions would likely be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions. For example, the impact of sustained reduced commodity prices on future undiscounted cash flows would likely be partially offset by lower costs. Impairment Assessments of Goodwill Goodwill must be tested for impairment at least annually, or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. We performed our annual impairment test in April 2016 for the International E&P reporting unit and no impairment was required. Based on the results of these assessments, we fully impaired the goodwill associated with our North America E&P reporting unit. As of the date of our last goodwill impairment assessment, our International E&P reporting unit fair value exceeded its book value of $115 million by 26%. We estimate the fair values of the International E&P reporting unit using a combination of market and income approaches. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The market approach referenced observable inputs specific to us and our industry. The income approach calculated the present value of expected future cash flows, which were based on forecasted assumptions. Key assumptions to the income approach are the same as those described above regarding our impairment assessment of long-lived assets. We believe the estimates and assumptions used in our impairment assessments are reasonable and based on available market information, but variations in such assumptions could result in materially different calculations of fair value and determinations of whether or not an impairment is indicated. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of goodwill. Derivatives We record all derivative instruments at fair value. Fair value measurements for all our derivative instruments are based on observable market-based inputs that are corroborated by market data and are discussed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. Additional information about derivatives and their valuation may be found in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 51 Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in numerous taxing jurisdictions worldwide. Estimates of income taxes to be recorded involve interpretation of complex tax laws and assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our U.S. federal income taxes. We have recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between book basis and tax basis, tax credit carryforwards and operating loss carryforwards. We routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In assessing the need for additional or adjustments to existing valuation allowances, we consider the preponderance of evidence concerning the realization of the deferred tax asset. We must consider any prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that might minimize the amount of deferred tax liabilities recognized or the amount of any valuation allowance recognized against deferred tax assets, if we can implement the strategies and if we expect to implement them in the event the forecasted conditions actually occur. This assessment requires analysis of all available positive and negative evidence. Positive evidence includes reversals of temporary differences, forecasts of future taxable income, assessment of future business assumptions and applicable tax planning strategies. Negative evidence includes losses in recent years as well as the forecasts of future income (loss) in the realizable period. We expect to be in a cumulative loss position in early 2017, which constitutes significant objective negative evidence as to the future realizability of the value of our deferred tax assets. As a result, we are limited in our ability to consider forecasts for taxable income in future years in connection with our assessment of the realizability of our foreign tax credits and other federal deferred tax assets. Additionally, we considered the reversals of existing deferred tax assets and liabilities related to temporary differences between the book and tax basis of our assets and liabilities and concluded that it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets would not be realized. Therefore, we increased our valuation allowance on our federal deferred tax assets by $1,346 million in 2016. Our remaining U.S. operating loss carryforwards of $1.8 billion , which expire in 2035 and 2036, represent the federal deferred tax asset most at risk for an additional valuation allowance at December 31, 2016. See further detail in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements . We base our future taxable income estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonably likely to occur. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the estimation of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions and the assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our U.S. federal income taxes. Future operating conditions can be affected by numerous factors, including (i) future crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil prices, (ii) estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil, (iii) expected timing of production, and (iv) future capital requirements. These assumptions are described in further detail above regarding our impairment assessment of long-lived assets, see above for further detail describing these assumptions. An estimate of the sensitivity to changes in assumptions resulting in future taxable income calculations is not practicable, given the numerous assumptions that can materially affect our estimates. Unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions would likely be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions. For example, the impact of sustained reduced commodity prices on future taxable income would likely be partially offset by lower costs. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations Accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the following: the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; the expected long-term return on plan assets; the rate of future increases in compensation levels; and health care cost projections. We develop our demographics and utilize the work of third-party actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations. We have selected different discount rates for our U.S. pension plans and our other U.S. postretirement benefit plans due to the different projected benefit payment patterns. In determining the assumed discount rates, our methods include a review of market yields on high-quality corporate debt and use of our third-party actuary's discount rate model. This model calculates an equivalent single discount rate for the projected benefit plan cash flows using a yield curve derived from bond yields. The yield curve represents a series of annualized individual spot discount rates from 0.5 to 99 years. The bonds used are rated AA or higher by a recognized rating agency, only non-callable bonds are included and outlier bonds (bonds that have a yield to maturity that significantly deviates from the average yield within each maturity grouping) are removed. Each issue is required to have at least $250 million par value outstanding. The constructed yield curve is based on those bonds representing the 50% highest yielding issuances within each defined maturity group. Of the assumptions used to measure obligations and estimated annual net periodic benefit cost as of December 31, the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit cost reported for the plans. The hypothetical impacts of a 52 0.25% change in the discount rates of 4.02% for our U.S. pension plans and 3.98% for our other U.S. postretirement benefit plans is summarized in the table below: Impact of a 0.25% Increase in Discount Rate Impact of a 0.25% Decrease in Discount Rate (In millions) Obligation Expense Obligation Expense U.S. pension plans $ (5 ) $ $ 6 $ Other U.S. postretirement benefit plans $ (5 ) $ $ 5 $ The asset rate of return assumption for the funded U.S. plan considers the plan's asset mix (currently targeted at approximately 55% equity and 45% other fixed income securities), past performance and other factors. Certain components of the asset mix are modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation, debt returns and stock yields. Decreasing the 6.75% asset rate of return assumption by 0.25% would not have a significant impact on our defined benefit pension expense. Compensation change assumptions are based on historical experience, anticipated future management actions and demographics of the benefit plans. Health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements includes detailed information about the assumptions used to calculate the components of our annual defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan expense, as well as the obligations and accumulated other comprehensive income reported on the consolidated balance sheets. Contingent Liabilities We accrue contingent liabilities for environmental remediation, tax deficiencies related to operating taxes, as well as tax disputes and litigation claims when such contingencies are probable and estimable. Actual costs can differ from estimates for many reasons. For instance, settlement costs for claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on responsibility and assessments of the amount of damages. Similarly, liabilities for environmental remediation may vary from estimates because of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation, additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination and improvements in technology. Our in-house legal counsel regularly assesses these contingent liabilities. In certain circumstances outside legal counsel is utilized. We generally record losses related to these types of contingencies as other operating expense or general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income, except for tax contingencies unrelated to income taxes, which are recorded as taxes other than income. For additional information on contingent liabilities, see Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Management Discussion and Analysis of Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies. An estimate of the sensitivity to net income if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practical because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, in terms of both the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss.
