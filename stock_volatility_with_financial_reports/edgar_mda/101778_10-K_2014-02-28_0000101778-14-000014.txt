Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Each of our segments is organized and managed based upon both geographic location and the nature of the products and services it offers: North America E&P explores for, produces and markets liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas in North America; International E&P explores for, produces and markets liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas outside of North America and produces and markets products manufactured from natural gas, such as LNG and methanol, in E.G.; and Oil Sands Mining mines, extracts and transports bitumen from oil sands deposits in Alberta, Canada, and upgrades the bitumen to produce and market synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil. Certain sections of Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations include forward-looking statements concerning trends or events potentially affecting our business. These statements typically contain words such as "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "expects," "targets," "plans," "projects," "could," "may," "should," "would" or similar words indicating that future outcomes are uncertain. In accordance with "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, these statements are accompanied by cautionary language identifying important factors, though not necessarily all such factors, which could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. For additional risk factors affecting our business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the information under Item 1. Business, Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data found in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Spin-off Downstream Business On June 30, 2011, the spin-off of Marathon downstream business was completed, creating two independent energy companies: Marathon Oil and MPC. Marathon stockholders at the close of business on the record date of June 27, 2011 received one share of MPC common stock for every two shares of Marathon common stock held. A private letter tax ruling received in June 2011 from the IRS affirmed the tax-free nature of the spin-off. Activities related to the downstream business have been treated as discontinued operations for all periods prior to the spin-off (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information). Overview Market Conditions Prevailing prices for the various qualities of crude oil and natural gas that we produce significantly impact our revenues and cash flows. The following table lists benchmark crude oil and natural gas price averages relative to our North America E&P and International E&P segments for the past three years. Benchmark 2013 2012 2011 WTI crude oil (Dollars per bbl) $98.05 $94.15 $95.11 Brent (Europe) crude oil (Dollars per bbl) $108.64 $111.65 $111.26 Henry Hub natural gas (Dollars per mmbtu) (a) $3.65 $2.79 $4.04 (a) Settlement date average. North America E&P Liquid hydrocarbons The quality, location and composition of our liquid hydrocarbon production mix can cause our North America E&P price realizations to differ from the WTI benchmark. Quality Light sweet crude contains less sulfur and tends to be lighter than sour crude oil so that refining it is less costly and has historically produced higher value products; therefore, light sweet crude is considered of higher quality and has historically sold at a price that approximates WTI or at a premium to WTI. The percentage of our North America E&P crude oil and condensate production that is light sweet crude has been increasing as onshore production from the Eagle Ford and Bakken increases and production from the Gulf of Mexico declines. In 2013 , the percentage of our U.S. crude oil and condensate production that was sweet averaged 76 percent compared to 63 percent and 42 percent in 2012 and 2011 . Location In recent years, crude oil sold along the U.S. Gulf Coast, such as that from the Eagle Ford, has been priced based on the Louisiana Light Sweet ("LLS") benchmark which has historically priced at a premium to WTI and has historically tracked closely to Brent, while production from inland areas farther from large refineries has been priced lower. The average annual WTI 35 discount to Brent was narrower in 2013 than in 2012 and 2011. As a result of the significant increase in U.S. production of light sweet crude oil, the historical relationship between WTI, Brent and LLS pricing may not be indicative of future periods. Composition The proportion of our liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes that are NGLs continues to increase due to our development of United States unconventional liquids-rich plays. NGLs were 15 percent of our North America E&P liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes in 2013 compared to 10 percent in 2012 and 7 percent in 2011 . Natural gas A significant portion of our natural gas production in the U.S. is sold at bid-week prices, or first-of-month indices relative to our specific producing areas. Average Henry Hub settlement prices for natural gas were 31 percent higher for 2013 than for 2012 . International E&P Liquid hydrocarbons Our International E&P crude oil production is relatively sweet and has historically sold in relation to the Brent crude benchmark, which on average was 3 percent lower for 2013 than 2012 . Natural gas Our major International E&P natural gas-producing regions are Europe and E.G. Natural gas prices in Europe have been considerably higher than the U.S. in recent years. In the case of E.G., our natural gas sales are subject to term contracts, making realized prices in these areas less volatile. The natural gas sales from E.G. are at fixed prices; therefore, our reported average International E&P natural gas realized prices may not fully track market price movements. Oil Sands Mining The Oil Sands Mining segment produces and sells various qualities of synthetic crude oil. Output mix can be impacted by operational problems or planned unit outages at the mines or upgrader. Sales prices for roughly two-thirds of the normal output mix has historically tracked movements in WTI and one-third has historically tracked movements in the Canadian heavy crude oil marker, primarily WCS. The WCS discount to WTI has been increasing on average in each year presented below. Despite a wider WCS discount in 2013, our average Oil Sands Mining price realizations increased due to a greater proportion of higher value synthetic crude oil sales volumes compared to 2012. The operating cost structure of the Oil Sands Mining operations is predominantly fixed and therefore many of the costs incurred in times of full operation continue during production downtime. Per-unit costs are sensitive to production rates. Key variable costs are natural gas and diesel fuel, which track commodity markets such as the AECO natural gas sales index and crude oil prices, respectively. The table below shows average benchmark prices that impact both our revenues and variable costs: Benchmark 2013 2012 2011 WTI crude oil (Dollars per bbl) $98.05 $94.15 $95.11 WCS (Dollars per bbl) (a) $72.77 $73.18 $77.97 AECO natural gas sales index (Dollars per mmbtu) (b) $3.08 $2.39 $3.68 (a) Monthly pricing based upon average WTI adjusted for differentials unique to western Canada. (b) Monthly average day ahead index. 36 Key Operating and Financial Activities Significant 2013 activities related to our strategic imperatives: Production growth Total company net sales volume growth of 11 percent (excluding Alaska and Libya) North America E&P net sales volumes averaged 201 mboed, a 21 percent increase over last year Eagle Ford averaged net sales volumes of 81 mboed, a 136 percent increase Bakken averaged net sales volumes of 39 mboed, a 34 percent increase Oklahoma resource basins averaged net sales volumes of 14 mboed, a 68 percent increase Proved reserve replacement of 194 percent, excluding dispositions Total net proved reserves increased 8 percent to approximately 2.2 billion boe Quality resource capture through focused exploration Mirawa-1 discovery on operated Harir block in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq Diaman-1B discovery on non-operated Diaba License in Gabon Atrush block received approval from the KRG for the first phase of oil development in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq Shenandoah and Gunflint (both non-operated) prospects had successful appraisal wells in the Gulf of Mexico Rigorous portfolio management Exceeded three-year $1.5 billion to $3 billion divestiture target Agreements to sell working interests in Angola Blocks 31 and 32 with an aggregate transaction value of $2.1 billion, before closing adjustments Sold our interests in Alaska, the DJ Basin and the Neptune gas plant Acquired 4,800 additional net acres in the core of the Eagle Ford shale Grew SCOOP acreage position over 20 percent Commenced efforts to market our U.K. and Norway assets Competitive shareholder value Increased dividend by 12 percent to 19 cents per share Repurchased 14 million common shares for $500 million Announced $500 million share repurchase to begin upon closing of Angola Block 31 sale Authorized $1.2 billion increase in share repurchase program to $2.5 billion remaining Significant 2014 activity through February 28, 2014 includes: Closed sale of our interest in Angola Block 31 37 Consolidated Results of Operations: 2013 compared to 2012 Consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes in 2013 was 20 percent lower than 2012 primarily due to lower liquid hydrocarbon net sales volumes in the International E&P segment and higher DD&A and exploration expenses, partially offset by higher liquid hydrocarbon net sales volumes in the North America E&P segment. The effective tax rate for continuing operations was 68 percent in 2013 compared to 74 percent in 2012 , with the decrease primarily related to lower income from continuing operations in Libya and Norway, which are higher tax jurisdictions. Sales and other operating revenues, including related party are summarized by segment in the following table: (In millions) 2013 2012 Sales and other operating revenues, including related party North America E&P $ 5,068 $ 3,944 International E&P 5,827 7,445 Oil Sands Mining 1,576 1,521 Segment sales and other operating revenues, including related party 12,471 12,910 Unrealized gain (loss) on crude oil derivative instruments (52 ) 53 Sales and other operating revenues, including related party $ 12,419 $ 12,963 North America E&P sales and other operating revenues increased $1,124 million from 2012 to 2013 primarily due to higher liquid hydrocarbon net sales volumes resulting from ongoing development programs in the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Oklahoma resource basins, partially offset by lower natural gas net sales volumes, primarily the result of the sale of our Alaska assets in early 2013. The following table gives details of net sales volumes and average price realizations of our North America E&P segment: 2013 2012 North America E&P Operating Statistics Net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes (mbbld) 149 107 Liquid hydrocarbon average price realizations (per bbl) (a) (b) $85.20 $85.80 Net crude oil and condensate sales volumes (mbbld) 126 96 Crude oil and condensate average price realizations (per bbl) (a) $94.19 $91.30 Net natural gas liquids sales volumes (mbbld) 23 11 Natural gas liquids average price realizations (per bbl) (a) $35.12 $39.57 Net natural gas sales volumes (mmcfd) 312 358 Natural gas average price realizations (per mcf) (a) $3.84 $3.92 (a) Excludes gains and losses on derivative instruments. (b) Inclusion of realized gains (losses) on crude oil derivative instruments would have increased (decreased) average liquid hydrocarbon price realizations per bbl by $(0.27) for 2013 and $0.40 for 2012 . International E&P sales and other operating revenues decreased $1,618 million in 2013 from the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to lower liquid hydrocarbon net sales volumes in Libya and Norway and lower liquid hydrocarbon average price realizations. 38 The following table gives details of net sales volumes and average price realizations of our International E&P segment: 2013 2012 International E&P Operating Statistics Net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes (mbbld) (a) Europe 86 97 Africa 58 78 Total International E&P 144 175 Liquid hydrocarbon average price realizations (per bbl) Europe $112.60 $115.16 Africa $86.29 $98.52 Total International E&P $102.10 $107.78 Net natural gas sales volumes (mmcfd) Europe (b) 83 101 Africa 464 443 Total International E&P 547 544 Natural gas average price realizations (per mcf) Europe $12.08 $10.47 Africa (c) $0.49 $0.43 Total International E&P $2.25 $2.29 (a) Corresponds with the basis for fiscal settlements with governments, representing equity tanker liftings and direct deliveries of liquid hydrocarbons. (b) Includes natural gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale of 7 mmcfd and 15 mmcfd for 2013 and 2012 . (c) Primarily represents fixed prices under long-term contracts with Alba Plant LLC, AMPCO, and EGHoldings, equity method investees. We include our share of Alba Plant LLC's, AMPCO's and EGHoldings' income in our International E&P segment. Oil Sands Mining sales and other operating revenues increased $55 million in 2013 from 2012 . This increase was primarily due to a higher proportion of net sales volumes related to a premium grade synthetic crude oil and the associated average price realizations when compared to 2012 . The increase was partially offset by lower feedstock sales in 2013. The following table gives details of net sales volumes and average price realizations of our Oil Sands Mining segment: 2013 2012 Oil Sands Mining Operating Statistics Net synthetic crude oil sales volumes (mbbld) (a) 48 47 Synthetic crude oil average price realizations (per bbl) $87.51 $81.72 (a) Includes blendstocks. Unrealized gains and losses on crude oil derivative instruments are included in total sales and other operating revenues but are not allocated to the segments. These crude oil derivative instruments, all of which had terms that ended in December 2013, resulted in a $52 million net unrealized loss in 2013 compared to a net unrealized gain of $53 million in 2012 . See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for information about our derivative positions. Marketing revenues decreased $647 million in 2013 from 2012 . North America E&P segment marketing activities, which serve to aggregate volumes in order to satisfy transportation commitments as well as to achieve flexibility within product types and delivery points, decreased in 2013 as a result of market dynamics. Income from equity method investments increased $53 million in 2013 from the prior year primarily due to higher LNG average price realizations. Net gain (loss) on disposal of assets in 2013 primarily included a $114 million pretax loss on the sale of our interests in the DJ Basin, a $43 million pretax loss on the conveyance of our interests in the Marcellus natural gas shale play to the operator, a $98 million pretax gain on the sale of our interest in the Neptune gas plant, and a $55 million pretax gain on the sale of our remaining assets in Alaska. The net gain on disposal of assets in 2012 consisted primarily of a $166 million pretax gain on the sale of our interests in several Gulf of Mexico crude oil pipeline systems and a $36 million pretax loss related to our exit from Indonesia. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for information about these dispositions. Production expenses increased $129 million in 2013 from 2012 primarily related to increased North America E&P net sales volumes in the Eagle Ford and Bakken and International E&P well workovers in Norway. The production expense rate (expense 39 per boe) decreased in North America E&P in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to improved operating efficiencies in the Eagle Ford . The International E&P production expense rate increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to the well workovers in Norway. The following table provides production expense rates for each segment: ($ per boe) 2013 2012 North America E&P $10.86 $11.59 International E&P $6.24 $5.13 Oil Sands Mining (a) $46.30 $45.95 (a) Production expense per synthetic crude oil barrel (before royalties) includes production costs, shipping and handling, taxes other than income and insurance costs and excludes pre-development costs. Marketing expenses decreased $672 million in 2013 from the prior year, consistent with the decrease in marketing revenues discussed above. Exploration expenses were $282 million higher in 2013 than in 2012 , primarily due to larger non-cash unproved property impairments in our North America E&P segment related to Eagle Ford leases that either expired or that we did not expect to drill, partially offset by reduced geological and geophysical costs. The following table summarizes the components of exploration expenses: (In millions) 2013 2012 Unproved property impairments $ 580 $ 227 Dry well costs 218 230 Geological and geophysical 84 135 Other 106 114 Total exploration expenses $ 988 $ 706 Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $313 million in 2013 from the prior year. Our segments apply the units-of-production method to the majority of their assets, including capitalized asset retirement costs. Increased DD&A in 2013 primarily reflects the impact of higher North America E&P sales volumes as well as increased amortization of capitalized asset retirement costs due to revisions of estimates for abandonment obligations in the Gulf of Mexico and the U.K. However, the disposition of our Alaska assets in January 2013 and lower International E&P DD&A primarily due to 2013 reserve additions in Norway partially offset the increase. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for information about the Alaska disposition. The DD&A rate (expense per boe), which is impacted by changes in reserves and capitalized costs, can also cause changes to our DD&A. A higher 2013 DD&A rate in North America E&P versus 2012 is due to the ongoing development programs in the U.S. resource plays. A lower International E&P DD&A rate in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to reserve increases for Norway. The following table provides DD&A rates for each segment: ($ per boe) 2013 2012 North America E&P $26.23 $23.45 International E&P $7.26 $8.08 Oil Sands Mining $12.39 $12.57 Impairments in 2013 primarily related to capitalized costs associated with engineering and feasibility studies for a second LNG production train in E.G., the Ozona development in the Gulf of Mexico, and our Powder River Basin asset in Wyoming. Impairments in 2012 were also related to the Ozona development and Powder River Basin. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for information about these impairments. Taxes other than income include production, severance and ad valorem taxes in the United States, which tend to increase or decrease in relation to net sales volumes and revenues, and increased $104 million in 2013 from 2012 . With the increase in North America E&P revenues and net sales volumes, production and severance taxes increased. In addition, ad valorem taxes were higher because the value of our North America E&P assets has increased with continued acquisitions in the Eagle Ford. Net interest and other increased $55 million in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to higher interest expense related to our $2 billion issuance of senior notes in late 2012. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed information. 40 Provision for income taxes decreased $1,180 million in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to the decrease in pretax income from continuing operations, primarily in Libya and Norway, which are higher tax jurisdictions. The following is an analysis of the effective tax rates for 2013 and 2012 . 2013 2012 Statutory rate applied to income from continuing operations before income taxes 35 % 35 % Effects of foreign operations, including foreign tax credits 14 18 Adjustments to valuation allowances 18 21 Other 1 Effective income tax rate on continuing operations 68 % 74 % The effective income tax rate is influenced by a variety of factors including the geographic sources of income and the relative magnitude of these sources of income. The provision for income taxes is allocated on a discrete, stand-alone basis to pretax segment income and to individual items not allocated to segments. The difference between the total provision and the sum of the amounts allocated to segments appears in the "Corporate and other unallocated items" shown in the reconciliation of segment income to net income below. Effects of foreign operations The effects of foreign operations on our effective tax rate decreased in 2013 as compared to 2012 , primarily due to decreased sales in Libya during 2013 as a result of third-party labor strikes at the Es Sider oil terminal. Adjustments to valuation allowances In 2013 and 2012, we increased the valuation allowance against foreign tax credits because it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize all U.S. benefits on foreign taxes accrued in those years. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about income taxes. Discontinued operations is presented net of tax. In 2013, we entered into agreements to sell our Angola assets; therefore, the Angola operations are reflected as discontinued operations in all periods presented. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. Segment Results: 2013 compared to 2012 Segment income for 2013 and 2012 is summarized and reconciled to net income in the following table. (In millions) 2013 2012 North America E&P $ 529 $ 382 International E&P 1,423 1,660 Oil Sands Mining 206 171 Segment income 2,158 2,213 Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes: Corporate and other unallocated items (473 ) (475 ) Unrealized gain (loss) on crude oil derivative instruments (33 ) 34 Net gain (loss) on dispositions (20 ) 72 Impairments (39 ) (231 ) Income from continuing operations 1,593 1,613 Discontinued operations 160 (31 ) Net income $ 1,753 $ 1,582 North America E&P segment income increased $147 million in 2013 compared to 2012 . The increase was largely due to increased liquid hydrocarbon net sales volumes primarily in the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Oklahoma resource basins, partially offset by higher DD&A associated with the higher sales volumes. Segment income was also negatively impacted by higher exploration expenses related to non-cash unproved property impairments and the sale of our Alaska assets. International E&P segment income decreased $237 million in 2013 compared to 2012 . The decrease was primarily related to the lower liquid hydrocarbon net sales volumes in Libya and Norway and lower average liquid hydrocarbon price realizations, as well as higher exploration expenses, partially offset by lower DD&A associated with the lower sales volumes. 41 Oil Sands Mining segment income increased $35 million in 2013 compared to 2012 . This increase was primarily due to a higher proportion of net sale volumes in 2013 related to a premium grade of synthetic crude oil with a higher corresponding price realization. Consolidated Results of Operations: 2012 compared to 2011 Consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes in 2012 was 38 percent higher than in 2011 primarily related to increases in North America E&P and International E&P liquid hydrocarbon net sales volumes and higher average price realizations in International E&P. The effective tax rate for continuing operations was 74 percent in 2012 compared to 61 percent in 2011 , with the increase primarily related to resumption in 2012 of sales in Libya, which is a higher tax jurisdiction. Also, in 2011 we were not in an excess foreign tax credit position for the entire year as we were in 2012. Sales and other operating revenues, including related party are summarized by segment in the following table: (In millions) 2012 2011 Sales and other operating revenues, including related party North America E&P $ 3,944 $ 3,364 International E&P 7,445 5,851 Oil Sands Mining 1,521 1,535 Segment sales and other operating revenues, including related party 12,910 10,750 Unrealized gain (loss) on crude oil derivative instruments 53 Sales and other operating revenues, including related party $ 12,963 $ 10,750 North America E&P sales and other operating revenue s increased $580 million in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to higher liquid hydrocarbon net sales volumes resulting from ongoing development programs in the Eagle Ford and Bakken, partially offset by lower average liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas price realizations, when compared to 2011 . Realized gains on our North America E&P crude oil derivative instruments were $15 million in 2012 , while there were no open crude oil derivative instruments in 2011. The following table gives details of net sales volumes and average price realizations of our North America E&P segment: 2012 2011 North America E&P Operating Statistics Net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes (mbbld) 107 75 Liquid hydrocarbon average price realizations (per bbl) (a)(b) $85.80 $92.55 Net crude oil and condensate sales volumes (mbbld) 96 70 Crude oil and condensate average price realizations (per bbl) (a) $91.30 $94.80 Net natural gas liquids sales volumes (mbbld) 11 5 Natural gas liquids average price realizations (per bbl) (a) $39.57 $58.53 Net natural gas sales volumes (mmcfd) 358 326 Natural gas average price realizations (per mcf) (a) $3.92 $4.95 (a) Excludes gains and losses on derivative instruments. (b) Inclusion of realized gains on crude oil derivative instruments would have increased average liquid hydrocarbon price realizations by $0.40 per bbl for 2012 . There were no crude oil derivative instruments in 2011 . International E&P sales and other operating revenues increased $1,594 million in 2012 from 2011 primarily as a result of the previously discussed resumption of liquid hydrocarbon sales in Libya. Higher average liquid hydrocarbon price realizations during 2012, again primarily related to Libyan crude oil, also contributed to the revenue increase. The following table gives details of net sales volumes and average price realizations of our International E&P segment: 2012 2011 International E&P Operating Statistics Net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes (mbbld) (a) Europe 97 101 Africa 78 43 Total International E&P 175 144 Liquid hydrocarbon average price realizations (per bbl) Europe $115.16 $115.55 Africa $98.52 $73.21 Total International E&P $107.78 $102.96 Net natural gas sales volumes (mmcfd) Europe (b) 101 97 Africa 443 443 Total International E&P 544 540 Natural gas average price realizations (per mcf) Europe $10.47 $9.84 Africa (c) $0.43 $0.24 Total International E&P $2.29 $1.97 (a) Corresponds with the basis for fiscal settlements with governments, representing equity tanker liftings and direct deliveries of liquid hydrocarbons. (b) Includes natural gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale of 15 mmcfd and 16 mmcfd for 2012 and 2011 . (c) Primarily represents fixed prices under long-term contracts with Alba Plant LLC, AMPCO, and EGHoldings, equity method investees. We include our share of Alba Plant LLC's, AMPCO's and EGHoldings' income in our International E&P segment. Oil Sands Mining sales and other operating revenues decreased $14 million in 2012 from 2011. This decrease was primarily the result of lower average price realizations which were partially offset by higher net sales volumes. The following table gives details of net sales volumes and average price realizations of our Oil Sands Mining segment: 2012 2011 Oil Sands Mining Operating Statistics Net synthetic crude oil sales volumes (mbbld) (a) 47 43 Synthetic crude oil average price realizations (per bbl) $81.72 $91.65 (a) Includes blendstocks. Unrealized gains and losses on crude oil derivative instruments are included in total sales and other operating revenues but are not allocated to the segments. These crude oil derivative instruments resulted in a net unrealized gain of $53 million in 2012 , however, there were no open crude oil derivative instruments in 2011 . See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our derivative positions. Marketing revenues decreased $1,190 million in 2012 from 2011. North America E&P segment marketing activities, which serve to aggregate volumes in order to satisfy transportation commitments as well as to achieve flexibility within product types and delivery points, decreased in 2012 as a result of market dynamics and slightly lower commodity prices. Income from equity method investments decreased $92 million in 2012 from the prior year primarily due to lower natural gas prices and turnarounds early in 2012 at our facilities in E.G. Also, in January 2012, we sold our equity investments in several Gulf of Mexico crude oil pipelines. Net gain (loss) on disposal of assets in 2012 consisted primarily of the $166 million pretax gain on the sale of our interests in several Gulf of Mexico crude oil pipeline systems and a $36 million pretax loss related to our exit from Indonesia. In 2011, the net gain on disposal of assets was primarily related to the $37 million pretax gain related to the assignment of interests in our DJ Basin acreage position, the $34 million pretax gain on the sale of our interest in the Burns Point gas plant and the $8 million pretax gain on the sale of our interest in the Alaska LNG facility. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for information about these dispositions. Production expenses increased $251 million in 2012 from 2011 . The increase is primarily related to increased liquid hydrocarbon net sales volumes in the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Libya as well as the 2012 planned turnaround in the U.K. The following table provides production expense rates (expense per boe) for each segment: 42 ($ per boe) 2012 2011 North America E&P $11.59 $11.51 International E&P $5.13 $4.80 Oil Sands Mining (a) $45.95 $46.27 (a) Production expense per synthetic crude oil barrel (before royalties) includes production costs, shipping and handling, taxes other than income and insurance costs and excludes pre-development costs. Marketing expenses decreased $1,154 million in 2012 from the prior year, consistent with the decreases in marketing revenues discussed above. Exploration expenses were $65 million higher in 2012 than in 2011 , primarily due to larger non-cash unproved property impairments. Unproved property impairments in 2012 related to Marcellus, Eagle Ford and Indonesia. The following table summarizes the components of exploration expenses. (In millions) 2012 2011 Unproved property impairments $ 227 $ 79 Dry well costs 230 278 Geological and geophysical 135 124 Other 114 160 Total exploration expenses $ 706 $ 641 Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $214 million in 2012 from the prior year. Our segments apply the units-of-production method to the majority of their assets; therefore, the previously discussed increases in North America E&P and International E&P sales volumes generally result in similar changes in DD&A. There was no depletion of our Alaska assets for much of 2012 because they were held for sale, which partially offset the DD&A increase. The DD&A rate (expense per boe), which is impacted by changes in reserves and capitalized costs, can also cause changes in our DD&A. The decreases in both the North America E&P and International E&P DD&A rates in 2012 compared to 2011 were primarily due to proved reserve additions. The following table provides DD&A rates for each segment: ($ per boe) 2012 2011 North America E&P $23.45 $25.15 International E&P $8.08 $9.70 Oil Sands Mining $12.57 $12.43 Impairments in 2012 primarily related to the Ozona development in the Gulf of Mexico and to our Powder River Basin asset in Wyoming. Impairments in 2011 primarily related to the Droshky development in the Gulf of Mexico and an intangible asset for an LNG delivery contract at Elba Island. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for information about these impairments. Taxes other than income include production, severance and ad valorem taxes in the United States, which tend to increase or decrease in relation to sales volumes and revenues, and increased $55 million in 2012 from 2011 . With the increase in revenues related to higher sales volumes, production and severance taxes increased. In addition, ad valorem taxes are higher because the value of our U.S. assets increased with the acquisitions in the Eagle Ford shale. Net interest and other increased $112 million in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to lower capitalized interest in 2012. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed information. Loss on early extinguishment of debt relates to debt retirements in February and March of 2011. 43 Provision for income taxes increased $1,791 million in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to the increase in pretax income from continuing operations, including the impact of the resumption of sales in Libya in the first quarter of 2012. The following is an analysis of the effective income tax rates for 2012 and 2011: 2012 2011 Statutory rate applied to income from continuing operations before income taxes 35 % 35 % Effects of foreign operations, including foreign tax credits 18 6 Change in permanent reinvestment assertion 5 Adjustments to valuation allowances 21 14 Tax law changes 1 Effective income tax rate on continuing operations 74 % 61 % The effective income tax rate is influenced by a variety of factors including the geographic sources of income and the relative magnitude of these sources of income. The provision for income taxes is allocated on a discrete, stand-alone basis to pretax segment income and to individual items not allocated to segments. The difference between the total provision and the sum of the amounts allocated to segments appears in the "Corporate and other unallocated items" shown in the reconciliation of segment income to net income below. Effects of foreign operations The effects of foreign operations on our effective tax rate increased in 2012 as compared to 2011 , primarily due to the resumption of sales in Libya in the first quarter of 2012, where the statutory rate is in excess of 90 percent. Change in permanent reinvestment assertion In the second quarter of 2011, we recorded $716 million of deferred U.S. tax on undistributed earnings of $2,046 million that we previously intended to permanently reinvest in foreign operations. Offsetting this tax expense were associated foreign tax credits of $488 million. In addition, we reduced our valuation allowance related to foreign tax credits by $228 million due to recognizing deferred U.S. tax on previously undistributed earnings. Adjustments to valuation allowances In 2012 and 2011, we increased the valuation allowance against foreign tax credits because it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize all U.S. benefits on foreign taxes accrued in those years. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about income taxes. Discontinued operations is presented net of tax, and reflects our downstream business that was spun off June 30, 2011 and our Angola business which we agreed to sell in 2013. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes 3 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 44 Segment Results: 2012 compared to 2011 Segment income for 2012 and 2011 is summarized and reconciled to net income in the following table. (In millions) 2012 2011 North America E&P $ 382 $ 392 International E&P 1,660 1,991 Oil Sands Mining 171 261 Segment income 2,213 2,644 Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes: Corporate and other unallocated items (475 ) (359 ) Unrealized gain on crude oil derivative instruments 34 Net gain on dispositions 72 45 Impairments (231 ) (195 ) Loss on early extinguishment of debt (176 ) Tax effect of subsidiary restructuring (122 ) Deferred income tax items (61 ) Water abatement - Oil Sands (48 ) Eagle Ford transaction costs (10 ) Income from continuing operations 1,613 1,718 Discontinued operations (31 ) 1,228 Net income $ 1,582 $ 2,946 North America E&P segment income decreased $10 million in 2012 compared to 2011 . The decrease is largely due to lower liquid hydrocarbon price realizations and increased exploration expenses due to non-cash unproved property impairments, partially offset by higher liquid hydrocarbon net sales volumes primarily in the Eagle Ford and Bakken. International E&P segment income decreased $331 million in 2012 compared to 2011 . The decrease included lower earnings in the U.K. and E.G., partially offset by higher earnings in Libya. Also, in 2011 we were not in an excess foreign tax credit position for the entire year as we were in 2012. Oil Sands Mining segment income decreased $90 million in 2012 compared to 2011 . The decrease is primarily due to lower synthetic crude oil price realizations partially offset by higher net sales volumes. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, Cash Flows and Liquidity Cash Flows Net cash provided by continuing operations was $5,091 million in 2013 compared to $4,036 million in 2012 and $5,441 million in 2011 . The $1,055 million increase in 2013 primarily reflects the impact of increased North America E&P liquid hydrocarbon net sales volumes on operating income. The $1,405 million decrease in 2012 was primarily the result of working capital changes related to the 2012 ramp-up of operations in the Eagle Ford and Libya along with the timing of tax payments. Net cash used in investing activities related to continuing operations totaled $4,294 million in 2013 compared to $5,092 million in 2012 and $6,865 million in 2011 . Significant investing activities include acquisitions, additions to property, plant and equipment and asset disposals. Acquisitions in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 included proved and unproved assets in the Eagle Ford. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the transactions. In recent years, the focus of most of our capital spending has been in our North America E&P segment related to unconventional resource plays like the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Oklahoma resource basins. Disposals of assets totaled $450 million , $467 million , and $518 million in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 . In 2013 , net proceeds were primarily related to the sales of our interests in Alaska, the Neptune gas plant, and the DJ Basin. In 2012 , net proceeds were primarily from the sales of our interests in several Gulf of Mexico crude oil pipeline systems, a sell-down of our interests in the Harir and Safen blocks in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, and the final collection of proceeds on a 2009 asset sale. Several sales of non-core assets and acreage sell-downs in 2011 resulted in net proceeds of $518 million . See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about dispositions. 45 Financing activities related to continuing operations resulted in a use of cash of $1,162 million in 2013 , provided cash of $1,600 million in 2012 and used cash of $5,211 million in 2011 . Debt repayments of $182 million , $145 million , and $2,877 million occurred in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 . Purchases of common stock used $500 million in cash during 2013 and $300 million in 2011. Dividend payments were uses of cash in every year. Sources of cash in 2012 included the issuance of a net $200 million in commercial paper and $2 billion in senior notes. In connection with the spin-off, we distributed $1,622 million to MPC in the second quarter of 2011. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our main sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, internally generated cash flow from operations, the issuance of notes, our committed revolving credit facility and sales of non-strategic assets. Our working capital requirements are supported by these sources and we may issue commercial paper backed by our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility to meet short-term cash requirements. We issued $10,870 million and repaid $10,935 million of commercial paper in 2013 , leaving a balance of $135 million outstanding at December 31, 2013 . Because of the alternatives available to us as discussed above and access to capital markets through the shelf registration discussed below, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements including our capital spending programs, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities, share repurchase program and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies. Capital Resources Credit Arrangements and Borrowings At December 31, 2013 , we had $ 6,462 million in long-term debt outstanding, $68 million of which is due within one year. We do not have any triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an event of default in the case of a downgrade of our credit ratings. At December 31, 2013 , we had no borrowings against our revolving credit facility and had $135 million in commercial paper outstanding under our commercial paper program, which is backed by the revolving credit facility. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the revolving credit facility. 2014 Asset Disposals The sale of our interest in Angola Block 31 closed in February 2014 for proceeds of $1.5 billion before closing adjustments. These proceeds will be used to repurchase $500 million of common stock with the remainder to be used for general corporate purposes. The sale of our interest in Angola Block 32 for proceeds of $590 million before closing adjustments is expected to close in the first quarter of 2014. Shelf Registration We are a "well-known seasoned issuer" for purposes of SEC rules, thereby allowing us to use a universal shelf registration statement should we choose to issue and sell various types of equity and debt securities. Beginning in the first quarter of 2013, we changed our reportable segments and subsequently have recast all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to reflect these new segments in our consolidated financial statements. We expect to update and file our universal shelf registration statement shortly after the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC. 46 Cash-Adjusted Debt-To-Capital Ratio Our cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio (total debt-minus-cash to total debt-plus-equity-minus-cash) was 25 percent at December 31, 2013 and 2012 . (Dollars in millions) 2013 2012 Commercial paper $ 135 $ 200 Long-term debt due within one year 68 184 Long-term debt 6,394 6,512 Total debt $ 6,597 $ 6,896 Cash $ 264 $ 684 Equity $ 19,344 $ 18,283 Calculation: Total debt $ 6,597 $ 6,896 Minus cash 264 684 Total debt minus cash 6,333 6,212 Total debt 6,597 6,896 Plus equity 19,344 18,283 Minus cash 264 684 Total debt plus equity minus cash $ 25,677 $ 24,495 Cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio 25 % 25 % Capital Requirements Capital Spending Our approved capital, investment and exploration spending budget for 2014 is $5,882 million . Additional details related to this 2014 budget are discussed in Outlook. Share Repurchase Program In 2013, our Board of Directors increased the authorization for repurchases of our common stock by $1.2 billion, bringing the total authorized to $6.2 billion of which $2.5 billion is remaining. As of December 31, 2013 , we had repurchased 92 million common shares at a cost of $3,722 million, with 14 million shares acquired at a cost of $500 million during the third quarter of 2013, 12 million shares acquired at a cost of $300 million in the third quarter of 2011 and 66 million shares purchased for $2,922 million prior to the spin-off of our downstream business. As previously discussed, a portion of the proceeds from the sale of our interest in Angola Block 31 will be used to repurchase $500 million of common stock. Purchases under the repurchase program may be in either open market transactions, including block purchases, or in privately negotiated transactions. This program may be changed based upon our financial condition or changes in market conditions and is subject to termination prior to completion. The program authorization does not include specific price targets or timetables. The timing of purchases under the program will be influenced by cash generated from operations, proceeds from potential asset sales, cash from available borrowings and market conditions. Other Expected Cash Outflows We plan to make contributions of up to $77 million to our funded pension plans during 2014 , and $11 million of that amount was paid in January 2014. Cash contributions to be paid from our general assets for the unfunded pension and postretirement plans are expected to be approximately $74 million and $19 million in 2014 . As of December 31, 2013 , $135 million of commercial paper and $68 million of our long-term debt is due in the next twelve months. Dividends of $ 508 million were paid during 2013 reflecting quarterly dividends of $0.17 per share in the first two quarters of the year and $0.19 per share in the last two quarters for a per share increase of 12 percent. On January 29, 2014, we announced that our Board of Directors had declared a dividend of $0.19 cents per share on Marathon Oil common stock, payable March 10, 2014, to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 19, 2014. Our opinions concerning liquidity and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. Factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance (as measured by various factors including cash provided from operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies. The discussion of liquidity above also 47 contains forward-looking statements regarding the use of proceeds from the sale of our interest in Angola Block 31, the timing and amount of repurchasing additional common stock and the timing of closing the sale of our interest in Angola Block 32. The expectations with respect to the use of proceeds from the sale of our interest in Angola Block 31 and the timing and amount of repurchasing additional common stock could be affected by changes in the prices and demand for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas, actions of competitors, disruptions or interruptions of our exploration or production operations, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions or acts of war or terrorist acts and other operating and economic considerations. The sale of our interest in Angola Block 32 is subject to customary closing conditions. The discussion of liquidity above also contains forward-looking statements regarding planned funding of pension plans, which are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of actual performance. Contractual Cash Obligations The table below provides aggregated information on our consolidated obligations to make future payments under existing contracts as of December 31, 2013 . (In millions) Total 2014 2015- 2016 2017- 2018 Later Years Short and long-term debt (excludes interest) (a) $ 6,572 $ 203 $ 1,068 $ 1,536 $ 3,765 Lease obligations 235 46 78 44 67 Purchase obligations: Oil and gas activities (b) 1,294 742 391 74 87 Service and materials contracts (c) 925 192 231 100 402 Transportation and related contracts 1,345 211 330 201 603 Drilling rigs and fracturing crews (d) 1,037 554 461 22 Other 237 42 57 32 106 Total purchase obligations 4,838 1,741 1,470 429 1,198 Other long-term liabilities reported in the consolidated balance sheet (e) 1,258 181 276 244 557 Total contractual cash obligations (f) $ 12,903 $ 2,171 $ 2,892 $ 2,253 $ 5,587 (a) We anticipate cash payments for interest of $299 million for 2014 , $596 million for 2015-2016, $520 million for 2017-2018 and $2,619 million for the remaining years for a total of $4,034 million. (b) Oil and gas activities include contracts to acquire property, plant and equipment and commitments for oil and gas exploration such as costs related to contractually obligated exploratory work programs that are expensed immediately. (c) Service and materials contracts include contracts to purchase services such as utilities, supplies and various other maintenance and operating services. (d) Some contracts may be canceled at an amount less than the contract amount. Were we to elect that option where possible at December 31, 2013 our minimum commitment would be $905 million. (e) Primarily includes obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits including medical and life insurance. We have estimated projected funding requirements through 2023. Also includes amounts for uncertain tax positions. (f) This table does not include the estimated discounted liability for dismantlement, abandonment and restoration costs of oil and gas properties of $2,096 million. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements. Transactions with Related Parties We own a 63 percent working interest in the Alba field offshore E.G. Onshore E.G., we own a 52 percent interest in an LPG processing plant, a 60 percent interest in an LNG production facility and a 45 percent interest in a methanol production plant, each through equity method investees. We sell our natural gas from the Alba field to these equity method investees as the feedstock for their production processes. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Off-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Although off-balance sheet arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes, we are not dependent on these arrangements to maintain our liquidity and capital resources, and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the off-balance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources. We will issue stand alone letters of credit when required by a business partner. Such letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 aggregated $119 million, $139 million, and $231 million. Most of the letters of credit are in support of obligations recorded in the consolidated balance sheet. For example, they are issued to counterparties to insure our payments for outstanding company debt and future abandonment liabilities. 48 Outlook Budget Our Board of Directors approved a capital, investment and exploration spending budget of $5,882 million for 2014 , including budgeted capital expenditures of $5,777 million . Our capital, investment and exploration spending budget is broken down by reportable segment in the table below. (In millions) 2014 Budget Percent of Total North America E&P $ 4,241 72 % International E&P 1,242 21 % Oil Sands Mining 294 5 % Segment total 5,777 98 % Corporate and other 105 2 % Total capital, investment and exploration spending budget $ 5,882 100 % We continue to focus on growing profitable reserves and production worldwide. In 2014, we are accelerating drilling activity in our three key U.S. unconventional resource plays: the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Oklahoma resource basins, which account for approximately 60 percent of our budget. The majority of spending in our unconventional resource plays is intended for drilling. With an increased number of rigs in each of these areas, we plan to drill more net wells in these areas than in any previous year. We also have dedicated a portion of our capital budget in these areas to facility construction and recompletions. In our conventional assets, we will follow a disciplined spending plan that is intended to provide stable production,with approximately 23 percent of our budget allocated to the development of these assets worldwide. We also plan to either drill or participate in 8 to 10 exploration wells throughout our portfolio, with 10 percent of our budget allocated to exploration projects. For additional information about expected exploration and development activities see Item 1. Business. The above discussion includes forward-looking statements with respect to projected spending and investment in exploration and development activities under the 2014 capital, investment and exploration spending budget, accelerated rig and drilling activity in the Eagle Ford, Bakken, and Oklahoma resource basins, and future exploratory and development drilling activity. Some factors which could potentially affect these forward-looking statements include pricing, supply and demand for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, timing of commencing production from new wells, drilling rig availability, availability of materials and labor, other risks associated with construction projects, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. These forward-looking statements may be further affected by the inability to obtain or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals or permits. The development projects could further be affected by presently known data concerning size and character of reservoirs, economic recoverability, future drilling success and production experience. The foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Sales Volumes We expect to increase our U.S. resource plays' net sales volumes by more than 30 percent in 2014 compared to 2013, excluding dispositions. In addition, we expect total production growth to be approximately 4 percent in 2014 versus 2013, excluding dispositions and Libya. Acquisitions and Dispositions Excluded from our budget are the impacts of acquisitions and dispositions not previously announced. We continually evaluate ways to optimize our portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures and exceeded our previously stated goal of divesting between $1.5 billion and $3.0 billion of assets over the period of 2011 through 2013. For the three-year period ended December 31, 2013 , we closed or entered agreements for approximately $3.5 billion in divestitures, of which $2.1 billion is from the sales of our Angola assets. The sale of our interest in Angola Block 31 closed in February 2014 and the sale of our interest in Angola Block 32 is expected to close in the first quarter of 2014. In December 2013, we announced the commencement of efforts to market our assets in the North Sea, both in the U.K. and Norway, which would simplify and concentrate our portfolio to higher margin growth opportunities and increase our production growth rate. The above discussion includes forward-looking statements with respect to our percentage growth rate of production, production available for sale, the sale of our interest in Angola Block 32 and the possible sale of our U.K. and Norway assets. Some factors 49 which could potentially affect our percentage growth rate of production and production available for sale include pricing, supply and demand for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, timing of commencing production from new wells, drilling rig availability, availability of materials and labor, the inability to obtain or delay in obtaining necessary government or third-party approvals and permits, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response thereto, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict. The timing of closing the sale of our interest in Block 32 is subject to customary closing conditions. The possible sale of our U.K. and Norway assets is subject to the identification of one or more buyers, successful negotiations, board approval and execution of definitive agreements. The foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Management Discussion and Analysis of Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies We have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, and production processes. Legislation and regulations pertaining to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions have the potential to materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including costs of compliance and permitting delays. The extent and magnitude of these adverse impacts cannot be reliably or accurately estimated at this time because specific regulatory and legislative requirements have not been finalized and uncertainty exists with respect to the measures being considered, the costs and the time frames for compliance, and our ability to pass compliance costs on to our customers. For additional information see Item 1A. Risk Factors. We accrue for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated. As environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise, charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required. For additional information see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 25 to the consolidated financial statements. New or expanded environmental requirements, which could increase our environmental costs, may arise in the future. We comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment, but since not all costs are fixed or presently determinable (even under existing legislation) and may be affected by future legislation or regulations, it is not possible to predict all of the ultimate costs of compliance, including remediation costs that may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed. For more information on environmental regulations that impact us, or could impact us, see Item 1. Business Environmental, Health and Safety Matters, Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 3. Legal Proceedings. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods. Accounting estimates are considered to be critical if (1) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and (2) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. 50 Estimated Quantities of Net Reserves The estimation of quantities of net reserves is a highly technical process performed by our engineers for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas and by outside consultants for synthetic crude oil, which is based upon several underlying assumptions that are subject to change. Estimates of reserves may change, either positively or negatively, as additional information becomes available and as contractual, operational, economic and political conditions change. We evaluate our reserves using drilling results, reservoir performance, seismic interpretation and future plans to develop acreage. The data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. Consequently, material revisions (upward or downward) to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. Reserve estimates are based upon an unweighted average of commodity prices in the prior 12-month period, using the closing prices on the first day of each month. These prices are not indicative of future market conditions. For a discussion of our reserve estimation process, including the use of third-party audits, see Item 1. Business. We use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities. The successful efforts method inherently relies on the estimation of proved liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves. The existence and the estimated amount of reserves affect, among other things, whether certain costs are capitalized or expensed, the amount and timing of costs depreciated, depleted or amortized into net income and the presentation of supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities. Additionally, both the expected future cash flows to be generated by oil and gas producing properties used in testing such properties for impairment and the expected future taxable income available to realize deferred tax assets also rely, in part, on estimates of quantities of net reserves. Depreciation and depletion of liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil producing properties is determined by the units-of-production method and could change with revisions to estimated proved reserves. Over the past three years, the impact on our depreciation and depletion rate due to revisions of previous reserve estimates has not been significant to any of our segments. The following table illustrates, on average, the sensitivity of each segment's units-of-production DD&A per boe and pretax income to a hypothetical five percent change in 2013 proved reserves based on 2013 production. Impact of a Five Percent Increase in Proved Reserves Impact of a Five Percent Decrease in Proved Reserves (In millions, except per boe) DD&A per boe Pretax Income DD&A per boe Pretax Income North America E&P $ (1.25 ) $ 92 $ 1.38 $ (101 ) International E&P (0.35 ) 30 0.38 (33 ) Oil Sands Mining $ (0.46 ) $ 7 $ 0.73 $ (11 ) Asset Retirement Obligations We have material legal, regulatory and contractual obligations to remove and dismantle long-lived assets and to restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations, including bitumen mining operations. A liability equal to the fair value of such obligations and a corresponding capitalized asset retirement cost are recognized on the balance sheet in the period in which the legal obligation is incurred and a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The capitalized asset retirement cost is depreciated using the units-of-production method and the discounted liability is accreted over the period until the obligation is satisfied, the impacts of which are recognized as DD&A in the consolidated statements of income. In many cases, the satisfaction and subsequent discharge of these liabilities is projected to occur many years, or even decades, into the future. Furthermore, the legal, regulatory and contractual requirements often do not provide specific guidance regarding removal practices and the criteria that must be fulfilled when the removal and/or restoration event actually occurs. Estimates of retirement costs are developed for each property based on numerous factors, such as the scope of the dismantlement, timing of settlement, interpretation of legal, regulatory and contractual requirements, type of production and processing structures, depth of water (if applicable), reservoir characteristics, depth of the reservoir, market demand for equipment, currently available dismantlement and restoration procedures and consultations with construction and engineering professionals. Inflation rates and credit-adjusted-risk-free interest rates are then applied to estimate the fair values of the obligations. To the extent these or other assumptions change after initial recognition of the liability, the fair value estimate is revised and the recognized liability adjusted, with a corresponding adjustment made to the related asset balance. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures regarding our asset retirement obligation estimates. An estimate of the sensitivity to net income if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practical because of the number of obligations that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of possible assumptions. 51 Fair Value Estimates Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. There are three approaches for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities: the market approach, the income approach and the cost approach, each of which includes multiple valuation techniques. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach uses valuation techniques to measure fair value by converting future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, into a single present value, or range of present values, using current market expectations about those future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace the service capacity of an asset. This is often referred to as current replacement cost. The cost approach assumes that the fair value would not exceed what it would cost a market participant to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility, adjusted for obsolescence. The fair value accounting standards do not prescribe which valuation technique should be used when measuring fair value and do not prioritize among the techniques. These standards establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in applying the various valuation techniques. Inputs broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make pricing decisions, including assumptions about risk. Level 1 inputs are given the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy while Level 3 inputs are given the lowest priority. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: Level 1 Observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets as of the measurement date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 2 Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. These are inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date. Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data and may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management best estimate of fair value. Valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs are favored. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest priority level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities within the levels of the fair value hierarchy. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures regarding our fair value measurements. Significant uses of fair value measurements include: impairment assessments of long-lived assets; impairment assessments of goodwill; allocation of the purchase price paid to acquire businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed; and recorded value of derivative instruments. Impairment Assessments of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill The need to test long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment can be based on several indicators, including a significant reduction in prices of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas or synthetic crude oil, unfavorable adjustments to reserves, significant changes in the expected timing of production, other changes to contracts or changes in the regulatory environment in which the property is located. Long-lived assets in use are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. For purposes of impairment evaluation, long-lived assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified, which generally is field-by-field for our North America E&P and International E&P assets and at the project level for OSM assets. If the sum of the undiscounted estimated cash flows from the use of the asset group and its eventual disposition is less than the carrying value of an asset group, the carrying value is written down to the estimated fair value. Unlike long-lived assets, goodwill must be tested for impairment at least annually, or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. Fair value calculated for the purpose of testing our long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment is estimated using the present value of expected future cash flows method and comparative market prices when appropriate. Significant judgment is involved in performing these fair value estimates since the results are based on forecasted assumptions. Significant assumptions include: 52 Future liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil prices. Our estimates of future prices are based on our analysis of market supply and demand and consideration of market price indicators. Although these commodity prices may experience extreme volatility in any given year, we believe long-term industry prices are driven by global market supply and demand. To estimate supply, we consider numerous factors, including the worldwide resource base, depletion rates, and OPEC production policies. We believe demand is largely driven by global economic factors, such as population and income growth, governmental policies, and vehicle stocks. The prices we use in our fair value estimates are consistent with those used in our planning and capital investment reviews. There has been significant volatility in liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil prices and estimates of such future prices are inherently imprecise. Estimated quantities of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and synthetic crude oil. Such quantities are based on a combination of reserve categories such that the combined volumes represent the most likely expectation of recovery. Expected timing of production. Production forecasts are the outcome of engineer studies which estimate reserves, as well as expected capital development programs. The actual timing of the production could be different than the projection. Cash flows realized later in the projection period are less valuable than those realized earlier due to the time value of money. The expected timing of production that we use in our fair value estimates is consistent with that used in our planning and capital investment reviews. Discount rate commensurate with the risks involved. We apply a discount rate to our expected cash flows based on a variety of factors, including market and economic conditions, operational risk, regulatory risk and political risk. This discount rate is also compared to recent observable market transactions, if possible. A higher discount rate decreases the net present value of cash flows. Future capital requirements. Our estimates of future capital requirements are based upon a combination of authorized spending and internal forecasts. We base our fair value estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonable. However, actual results may differ from these projections. An estimate of the sensitivity to net income resulting from impairment calculations is not practicable, given the numerous assumptions (e.g. reserves, pricing and discount rates) that can materially affect our estimates. That is, unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions may be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions. Acquisitions In accounting for business combinations, the purchase price paid to acquire a business is allocated to its assets and liabilities based on the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. A significant amount of judgment is involved in estimating the individual fair values of property, plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets. The most significant assumptions relate to the estimated fair values allocated to proved and unproved liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil properties. Estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired can have a significant effect on our results of operations in the future. We use all available information to make these fair value determinations and, for certain acquisitions, engage third-party consultants for assistance. During 2013, 2012 and 2011, we completed several business combinations in the Eagle Ford, the purchase prices of which were allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements). The fair values used to allocate the purchase price of an acquisition are often estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method, which requires us to estimate reserves as described above under Estimated Quantities of Net Reserves, project related future cash inflows and outflows and apply an appropriate discount rate. The estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain. Accordingly, actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value. Derivatives We record all derivative instruments at fair value. Fair value measurements for all our derivative instruments are based on observable market-based inputs that are corroborated by market data and are discussed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. Additional information about derivatives and their valuation may be found in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 53 Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in numerous taxing jurisdictions worldwide. Estimates of income taxes to be recorded involve interpretation of complex tax laws and assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our U.S. federal income taxes. We have recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between book basis and tax basis, tax credit carryforwards and operating loss carryforwards. We routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In assessing the need for additional or adjustments to existing valuation allowances, we consider the preponderance of evidence concerning the realization of the deferred tax asset. We must consider any prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that might minimize the amount of deferred tax liabilities recognized or the amount of any valuation allowance recognized against deferred tax assets, if we can implement the strategies and we expect to implement them in the event the forecasted conditions actually occur. Assumptions related to the permanent reinvestment of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are reconsidered quarterly to give effect to changes in our portfolio of producing properties and in our tax profile. Our net deferred tax assets, after valuation allowances, are expected to be realized through our future taxable income and the reversal of temporary differences. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the estimation of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil prices) and the assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our U.S. federal income taxes. The estimates and assumptions used in determining future taxable income are consistent with those used in our planning and capital investment reviews. We consider a combination of reserve categories related to our existing producing properties, as well as estimated quantities of liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil related to undeveloped discoveries if, in our judgment, it is likely that development plans will be approved in the foreseeable future. Assumptions regarding our ability to realize the U.S. federal benefit of foreign tax credits are based on certain estimates concerning future operating conditions (particularly as related to liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil prices), future financial conditions, income generated from foreign sources and our tax profile in the year that such credits may be claimed. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations Accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the following: the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; the expected long-term return on plan assets; the rate of future increases in compensation levels; and health care cost projections. We develop our demographics and utilize the work of third-party actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations. We have selected different discount rates for our U.S. pension plans and our other U.S. postretirement benefit plans due to the different projected benefit payment patterns. In determining the assumed discount rates, our methods include a review of market yields on high-quality corporate debt and use of our third-party actuary's discount rate model. This model calculates an equivalent single discount rate for the projected benefit plan cash flows using a yield curve derived from bond yields. The yield curve represents a series of annualized individual spot discount rates from 0.5 to 99 years. The bonds used are rated AA or higher by a recognized rating agency, only non-callable bonds are included and outlier bonds (bonds that have a yield to maturity that significantly deviates from the average yield within each maturity grouping) are removed. Each issue is required to have at least $250 million par value outstanding. The constructed yield curve is based on those bonds representing the 50 percent highest yielding issuances within each defined maturity group. Of the assumptions used to measure obligations and estimated annual net periodic benefit cost as of December 31, the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit cost reported for the plans. The hypothetical impacts of a 0.25 percent change in the discount rates of 4.28 percent for our U.S. pension plans and 4.85 percent for our other U.S. postretirement benefit plans is summarized in the table below: Impact of a 0.25 Percent Increase in Discount Rate Impact of a 0.25 Percent Decrease in Discount Rate (In millions) Obligation Expense Obligation Expense U.S. pension plans $ (38 ) $ (4 ) $ 40 $ 4 Other U.S. postretirement benefit plans $ (7 ) $ $ 8 $ The asset rate of return assumption for the funded U.S. plan considers the plan's asset mix (currently targeted at approximately 55 percent equity and high-yield bonds and 45 percent other fixed income securities), past performance and other factors. Certain 54 components of the asset mix are modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation, debt returns and stock yields. Our long-term asset rate of return assumption is compared to those of other companies and to our historical returns for reasonableness. Decreasing the 6.75 percent asset rate of return assumption by 0.25 would not have a significant impact on our defined benefit pension expense. Effective January 1, 2014, the expected long-term rate of return was changed from 7.25 percent to 6.75 percent and this change also did not have a significant impact. Compensation change assumptions are based on historical experience, anticipated future management actions and demographics of the benefit plans. Health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements includes detailed information about the assumptions used to calculate the components of our annual defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan expense, as well as the obligations and accumulated other comprehensive income reported on the consolidated balance sheets. Contingent Liabilities We accrue contingent liabilities for environmental remediation, tax deficiencies related to operating taxes, and litigation claims when such contingencies are probable and estimable. Actual costs can differ from estimates for many reasons. For instance, settlement costs for claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on responsibility and assessments of the amount of damages. Similarly, liabilities for environmental remediation may vary from estimates because of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation, additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination, and improvements in technology. Our in-house legal counsel regularly assesses these contingent liabilities. In certain circumstances, outside legal counsel is utilized. We generally record losses related to these types of contingencies as other operating expense or general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income, except for tax contingencies unrelated to income taxes, which are recorded as taxes other than income. For additional information on contingent liabilities, see Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Management Discussion and Analysis of Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies. An estimate of the sensitivity to net income if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practical because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, in terms of both the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss. Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted In June 2013, the FASB ratified the Emerging Issues Task Force consensus which requires that an unrecognized tax benefit (or a portion thereof ) be presented as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for an available net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or tax credit carryforward. This accounting standards update is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2014 and should be applied prospectively to unrecognized tax benefits that exist as of the effective date. Early adoption and retrospective application are permitted. Adoption of this accounting standards update will not have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In February 2013, an accounting standards update was issued to provide guidance for the recognition, measurement, and disclosure of obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation is fixed at the reporting date, except for obligations such as asset retirement and environmental obligations, contingencies, guarantees, income taxes and retirement benefits, which are separately addressed within U.S. GAAP. An entity is required to measure obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation is fixed at the reporting date as the sum of 1) the amount the entity agreed to pay on the basis of its arrangement among its co-obligors and 2) any amount the entity expects to pay on behalf of its co-obligors. Disclosure of the nature of the obligation, including how the liability arose, the relationship with other co-obligors and the terms and conditions of the arrangement is required. In addition, the total outstanding amount under the arrangement, not reduced by the effect of any amounts that may be recoverable from other entities, plus the carrying amount of any liability or receivable recognized must be disclosed. This accounting standards update is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2014 and should be applied retrospectively for those in-scope obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements that exist at the beginning of 2014. Early adoption is permitted. Adoption of this accounting standards update will not have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
