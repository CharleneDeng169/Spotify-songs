Item 2. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A ) This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based upon management current expectations and are subject to significant uncertainties and changes in circumstances. Please review MD&A Forward-Looking Statements for more information on the forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ( this Report ).Our actual results may differ materially from those included in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to, those described in Part II Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Report and in Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K ( 2018 Form 10-K ). Unless otherwise specified, references to notes to our consolidated financial statements refer to the notes to our consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2019 included in this Report. Management monitors a variety of key indicators to evaluate our business results and financial condition. The following MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and related notes in this Report and the more detailed information contained in our 2018 Form 10-K. INTRODUCTION We are a diversified financial services holding company with banking and non-banking subsidiaries. Capital One Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company ) offer a broad array of financial products and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients through branches, the internet and other distribution channels. As of March 31, 2019 , our principal subsidiaries included: Capital One Bank (USA), National Association ( COBNA ), which offers credit and debit card products, other lending products and deposit products; and Capital One, National Association ( CONA ), which offers a broad spectrum of banking products and financial services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients. The Company is hereafter collectively referred to as we, us or our. COBNA and CONA are collectively referred to as the Banks. Certain business terms used in this document are defined in the MD&A Glossary and Acronyms and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in this Report. Our consolidated total net revenues are derived primarily from lending to consumer, small business, and commercial customers net of funding costs associated with interest on deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt. We also earn non-interest income which primarily consists of interchange income net of reward expenses, and service charges and other customer-related fees. Our expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating expenses, marketing expenses and income taxes. Our principal operations are organized for management reporting purposes into three major business segments, which are defined primarily based on the products and services provided or the type of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio, asset/liability management by our centralized Corporate Treasury group and residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate that is not assessed to our primary business segments, are included in the Other category. Credit Card: Consists of our domestic consumer and small business card lending, and international card businesses in Canada and the United Kingdom ( U.K. ). Consumer Banking: Consists of our branch-based lending and deposit gathering activities for consumers and small businesses, national deposit gathering and national auto lending. Commercial Banking: Consists of our lending, deposit gathering, capital markets and treasury management services to commercial real estate and commercial and industrial customers. Our commercial and industrial customers typically include companies with annual revenues between $20 million and $2 billion. 4 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Business Developments We regularly explore and evaluate opportunities to acquire financial services and financial assets, including credit card and other loan portfolios, and enter into strategic partnerships as part of our growth strategy. We also explore opportunities to acquire technology companies and related assets to improve our information technology infrastructure and to deliver on our digital strategy. In addition, we regularly consider the potential disposition of certain of our assets, branches, partnership agreements or lines of business. We may issue equity or debt to fund our acquisitions. On July 26, 2018, we announced that we entered into a new, long-term credit card program agreement with Walmart Inc. ( Walmart ). Under the terms of the agreement, we will become the exclusive issuer of Walmart cobrand and private label credit card program in the U.S. On January 22, 2019, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the existing portfolio of Walmart cobrand and private label credit card receivables. We expect to launch the new issuance program and close on the acquired portfolio late in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter of 2019. SUMMARY OF SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA The following table presents selected consolidated financial data and performance from our results of operations for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 and selected comparative balance sheet data as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . We also provide selected key metrics we use in evaluating our performance, including certain metrics that are computed using non-GAAP measures. We believe these non-GAAP metrics provide useful insight to investors and users of our financial information as they provide an alternate measurement of our performance and assist in assessing our capital adequacy and level of return generated.

In comparison, we reported net income of $1.3 billion ($2.62 per diluted common share) on total net revenue of $6.9 billion for the first quarter of 2018 . Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio as calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach was 11.9% and 11.2% as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , respectively. See MD&A Capital Management below for additional information. On June 28, 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.2 billion of shares of our common stock ( 2018 Stock Repurchase Program ) beginning in the third quarter of 2018 through the end of the second quarter of 2019. We completed the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program in the fourth quarter of 2018. See MD&A Capital Management Dividend Policy and Stock Purchases for additional information. Below are additional highlights of our performance in the first quarter of 2019 . These highlights are generally based on a comparison between the results of the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 , except as otherwise noted. The changes in our financial condition and credit performance are generally based on our financial condition and credit performance as of March 31, 2019 compared to our financial condition and credit performance as of December 31, 2018 . We provide a more detailed discussion of our financial performance in the sections following this Executive Summary and Business Outlook . Total Company Performance Earnings: Our net income increased by $66 million to $1.4 billion in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 primarily driven by: higher non-interest income largely due to an increase in net interchange fees, driven by higher purchase volume and the impact of updated rewards cost estimates; and higher net interest income due to growth in our domestic credit card, commercial and auto loans portfolios, partially offset by lower net interest margin as well as the reduction in net interest income from the sale of our consumer home loan portfolio. These drivers were partially offset by increased marketing expense . Loans Held for Investment : Period-end loans held for investment decreased by $5.6 billion to $240.3 billion as of March 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 primarily driven by expected seasonal paydowns in our domestic credit card loan portfolio . Average loans held for investment decreased by $7.8 billion to $242.0 billion in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 primarily driven by the sale of our consumer home loan portfolio, partially offset by the growth in our commercial, auto and domestic credit card loan portfolios. Net Charge-Off and Delinquency Metrics: Our net charge-off rate increased by 5 basis points to 2.64% in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 primarily driven by the impact of lower loan balances from the sale of our consumer home loan portfolio, partially offset by growth in our commercial, auto and domestic credit card loan portfolios. Our 30+ day delinquency rate decreased by 44 basis points to 3.40% as of March 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 primarily driven by seasonally lower delinquency inventories in our auto and domestic credit card loan portfolios. Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses: Our allowance for loan and lease losses increased by $93 million to $7.3 billion as of March 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 primarily driven by an allowance build in our commercial loan portfolio due to isolated credit deterioration and portfolio growth. The allowance coverage ratio increased by 10 basis points to 3.04% as of March 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 primarily driven by expected seasonal paydowns in our domestic credit card loan portfolio. 8 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Business Outlook We discuss below our current expectations regarding our total company performance and the performance of our business segments based on market conditions, the regulatory environment and our business strategies. The statements contained in this section are based on our current expectations regarding our outlook for our financial results and business strategies. Our expectations take into account, and should be read in conjunction with, our expectations regarding economic trends and analysis of our business as discussed in Part I Item 1. Business and Part II Item 7. MD&A in our 2018 Form 10-K. Certain statements are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results could differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements. Except as otherwise disclosed, forward-looking statements do not reflect: any change in current dividend or repurchase strategies; the effect of any acquisitions, divestitures or similar transactions that have not been previously disclosed; or any changes in laws, regulations or regulatory interpretations, in each case after the date as of which such statements are made. See MD&A Forward-Looking Statements in this Report for more information on the forward-looking statements and Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2018 Form 10-K for factors that could materially influence our results. Total Company Expectations Net Interest Margin: We continue to expect increases in deposit costs will have a negative impact on our net interest margin throughout 2019. Marketing and Efficiency: We expect full-year marketing for 2019 to be modestly higher than full-year 2018 and to exhibit a more normal seasonal pattern than the exaggerated pattern in 2018. We expect to achieve modest improvements in full-year operating efficiency ratio, net of adjustments, in both 2019 and 2020, while in 2021 we expect our full-year operating efficiency ratio, net of adjustments, to improve to 42%. We expect operating efficiency ratio improvements to drive significant improvement in our total efficiency ratio by 2021. Capital: We expect that our capital and earnings are sufficient to support growth, the Walmart portfolio acquisition later in 2019, the phased-in impact of adopting CECL on January 1, 2020, as well as a capital distribution request for the 2019 CCAR cycle meaningfully higher than 2018, subject to regulatory approval. Business Segment Expectations Domestic Card: We estimate the acquired Walmart portfolio will be in the low $8 billion range at the time of close, and the initial allowance build for this portfolio to be around $100 million. The actual portfolio size will depend on program performance between this point and acquisition and the actual initial allowance build will depend on the amount and characteristics of the portfolio, as well as economic conditions and our loss forecasts at acquisition. We continue to expect $225 million in one-time expenses in 2019 to launch the new originations programs and integrate the acquired portfolio during 2019. Consumer Banking : We expect further increases in average deposit interest rate, as faster growth in higher rate deposits continues to change our product mix. 9 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Over the longer-term, we continue to expect that the charge-off rate in our auto finance business will increase gradually. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The section below provides a comparative discussion of our consolidated financial performance for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 . We provide a discussion of our business segment results in the following section, MD&A Business Segment Financial Performance. You should read this section together with our MD&A Executive Summary and Business Outlook , where we discuss trends and other factors that we expect will affect our future results of operations. Net Interest Income Net interest income represents the difference between the interest income, including certain fees, earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense paid on our interest-bearing liabilities. Interest-earning assets include loans, investment securities and other interest-earning assets, while our interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing deposits, securitized debt obligations, senior and subordinated notes, other borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. Generally, we include in interest income any past due fees on loans that we deem collectible. Our net interest margin, based on our consolidated results, represents the difference between the yield on our interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities, including the notional impact of non-interest-bearing funding. We expect net interest income and our net interest margin to fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 10 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 2 below presents, for each major category of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the average outstanding balance, interest income earned, interest expense incurred and average yield for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 . Nonperforming loans are included in the average loan balances below.

(2) Some of our commercial loans generate tax-exempt income. Accordingly, we present our Commercial Banking interest income and yields on a taxable- equivalent basis, calculated using the federal statutory rate of 21% and state taxes where applicable, with offsetting reductions to the Other category. Taxable-equivalent adjustments included in the interest income and yield computations for our Commercial banking loans totaled approximately $21 million and $20 million in the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 , respectively , with corresponding reductions to the Other category. ** Not meaningful. 11 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Net interest income increased by $73 million to $5.8 billion in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 , primarily driven by growth in our domestic credit card, commercial and auto loans portfolios, partially offset by lower net interest margin as well as the reduction in net interest income from the sale of our consumer home loan portfolio. Net interest margin decreased by 7 basis points to 6.86% in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 , driven by an increase on the average deposit rate paid due to deposit mix changes. Table 3 displays the change in our net interest income between periods and the extent to which the variance is attributable to: changes in the volume of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities; or changes in the interest rates related to these assets and liabilities.

The portion of interest income or interest expense attributable to both volume and rate is allocated proportionately when the calculation results in a positive value. When the portion of interest income or interest expense attributable to both volume and rate results in a negative value, the total amount is allocated to volume or rate, depending on which amount is positive. (2) Some of our commercial loans generate tax-exempt income. Accordingly, we present our Commercial Banking interest income and yields on a taxable- equivalent basis, calculated using the federal statutory rate of 21% and state taxes where applicable, with offsetting reductions to the Other category. 12 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Non-Interest Income Table 4 displays the components of non-interest income for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 . Table 4 : Non-Interest Income Three Months Ended March 31, (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 Interchange fees, net $ 758 $ 643 Service charges and other customer-related fees 353 432 Net securities gains 24 8 Other non-interest income: Mortgage banking revenue 46 38 Treasury and other investment income 56 8 Other 55 62 Total other non-interest income 157 108 Total non-interest income $ 1,292 $ 1,191 Non-interest income increased by $101 million to $1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to an increase in net interchange fees, driven by higher purchase volume and the impact of updated rewards cost estimates as well as higher treasury and other investment income, partially offset by lower service charges and other customer-related fees. Provision for Credit Losses Our provision for credit losses in each period is driven by net charge-offs, changes to the allowance for loan and lease losses, and changes to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. Our provision for credit losses remained flat at $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 as higher provision in our commercial loan portfolio due to isolated credit deterioration and portfolio growth was largely offset by lower provision in our credit card loan portfolio as a result of a smaller allowance build. The provision for credit losses as a percentage of net interest income was 29.2% and 29.3% in the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 , respectively. We provide additional information on the provision for credit losses and changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses within MD&A Credit Risk Profile, Note 4 Loans and Note 5 Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments . For information on the allowance methodology for each of our loan categories, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our 2018 Form 10-K. 13 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Non-Interest Expense Table 5 displays the components of non-interest expense for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 . Table 5 : Non-Interest Expense Three Months Ended March 31, (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 Salaries and associate benefits $ 1,573 $ 1,520 Occupancy and equipment 493 490 Marketing 517 414 Professional services 291 210 Communications and data processing 303 306 Amortization of intangibles 30 44 Other non-interest expense: Bankcard, regulatory and other fee assessments 87 169 Collections 95 108 Fraud losses 103 97 Other 179 215 Total other non-interest expense 464 589 Total non-interest expense $ 3,671 $ 3,573 Non-interest expense increased by $98 million to $3.7 billion in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to higher marketing expense as well as higher operating expenses associated with continued investments in technology and infrastructure, partially offset by lower bankcard, regulatory and other fee assessments. Income Taxes We recorded income tax provisions of $309 million ( 18.0% effective income tax rate) and $319 million (19.2% effective income tax rate) in the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations varies between periods due, in part, to fluctuations in our pre-tax earnings, which affects the relative tax benefit of tax-exempt income, tax credits and other permanent tax items. The decrease in our income tax provision and effective income tax rate in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 was primarily due to higher tax credits and lower non-deductible expenses relative to our income, partially offset by lower discrete tax benefits. We provide additional information on items affecting our income taxes and effective tax rate in Note 16 Income Taxes in our 2018 Form 10-K. CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS ANALYSIS Total assets increased by $653 million to $373.2 billion as of March 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 driven by an increase in cash and cash equivalents as well as restricted cash for securitization investors, largely offset by a decrease in loans held for investment primarily due to the expected seasonal paydowns in our domestic credit card loan portfolio. Total liabilities decreased by $1.2 billion to $319.7 billion as of March 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 primarily driven by maturities of our short-term Federal Home Loan Banks ( FHLB ) advances, partially offset by deposit growth. Stockholders equity increased by $1.8 billion to $53.5 billion as of March 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 primarily due to our net income of $1.4 billion and $603 million of other comprehensive income in the first quarter of 2019 , partially offset by dividend payments to our stockholders. The following is a discussion of material changes in the major components of our assets and liabilities during the first quarter of 2019 . Period-end balance sheet amounts may vary from average balance sheet amounts due to liquidity and balance sheet 14 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents management activities that are intended to support the adequacy of capital while managing our liquidity requirements, our customers and our market risk exposure in accordance with our risk appetite. Investment Securities Our investment securities portfolio consists primarily of the following: U.S. Treasury securities; U.S. government-sponsored enterprise or agency ( Agency ) and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities ( RMBS ); Agency commercial mortgage-backed securities ( CMBS ); and other securities. Agency securities include Government National Mortgage Association ( Ginnie Mae ) guaranteed securities, and Federal National Mortgage Association ( Fannie Mae ) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( Freddie Mac ) issued securities. The U.S. Treasury and Agency securities generally have high credit ratings and low credit risks, and our investments in U.S. Treasury and Agency securities represented 96% of our total investment portfolio, as of both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . The fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio decreased by $262 million to $45.9 billion as of March 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 primarily driven by sales and maturities outpacing purchases, partially offset by the fair value gains as a result of changes in interest rates. The fair value of our held to maturity securities portfolio increased by $336 million to $37.0 billion as of March 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 primarily driven by fair value gains as a result of changes in interest rates. Table 6 presents the amortized cost, carrying value and fair value for the major categories of our investment securities portfolio as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 .

We provide additional information on the composition of our loan portfolio and credit quality below in MD&A Credit Risk Profile , MD&A Consolidated Results of Operations and Note 4 Loans . Funding Sources Our primary source of funding comes from deposits, as they are a stable and relatively low cost source of funding. In addition to deposits, we also raise funding through the issuance of securitized debt obligations and other debt. Other debt primarily consists of senior and subordinated notes, FHLB advances secured by certain portions of our loan and securities portfolios, and federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. Table 8 provides the composition of our primary sources of funding as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 .

Total deposits increased by $5.3 billion to $255.1 billion as of March 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 primarily driven by strong growth in our deposit products as a result of our national banking growth strategy in our Consumer Banking business. Securitized debt obligations increased by $1.0 billion to $19.3 billion as of March 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 as debt issuances outpaced maturities in the first quarter of 2019. Other debt decreased by $9.5 billion to $31.1 billion as of March 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 primarily driven by maturities of our short-term FHLB advances. We provide additional information on our funding sources in MD&A Liquidity Risk Profile and in Note 8 Deposits and Borrowings . 16 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS In the ordinary course of business, we engage in certain activities that are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets, generally referred to as off-balance sheet arrangements. These activities typically involve transactions with unconsolidated variable interest entities ( VIEs ) as well as other arrangements, such as letters of credit, loan commitments and guarantees, to meet the financing needs of our customers and support their ongoing operations. We provide additional information regarding these types of activities in Note 6 Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations and Note 14 Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others . BUSINESS SEGMENT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE Our principal operations are organized for management reporting purposes into three major business segments, which are defined primarily based on the products and services provided or the type of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio, asset/liability management by our centralized Corporate Treasury group and residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate that is not assessed to our primary business segments, are included in the Other category. The results of our individual businesses, which we report on a continuing operations basis, reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources. We provide additional information on the allocation methodologies used to derive our business segment results in Note 18 Business Segments and Revenue from Contracts with Customers in our 2018 Form 10-K. We refer to the business segment results derived from our internal management accounting and reporting process as our managed presentation, which differs in some cases from our reported results prepared based on U.S. GAAP. There is no comprehensive authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to U.S. GAAP; therefore, the managed presentation of our business segment results may not be comparable to similar information provided by other financial services companies. In addition, our individual business segment results should not be used as a substitute for comparable results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We summarize our business segment results for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 and provide a comparative discussion of these results, as well as changes in our financial condition and credit performance metrics as of March 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018 . We provide a reconciliation of our total business segment results to our reported consolidated results in Note 13 Business Segments and Revenue from Contracts with Customers . Business Segment Financial Performance Table 9 summarizes our business segment results, which we report based on revenue and income from continuing operations, for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 .

(2) Net income (loss) for our business segments and the Other category is based on income from continuing operations, net of tax. (3) Some of our commercial investments generate tax-exempt income, tax credits or other tax benefits. Accordingly, we present our Commercial Banking revenue and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated using the federal statutory tax rate of 21% and state taxes where applicable, with offsetting reductions to the Other category. (4) In the first quarter of 2019, we made a change in how revenue is measured in our Commercial Banking business by revising the allocation of tax benefits on certain tax-advantaged investments. As such, prior period results have been recast to conform with the current period presentation. The result of this measurement change reduced the previously reported total net revenue in our Commercial Banking business by $30 million for the first quarter of 2018, with an offsetting increase in the Other category. Credit Card Business The primary sources of revenue for our Credit Card business are net interest income, net interchange income and fees collected from customers. Expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating costs and marketing expenses. Our Credit Card business generated net income from continuing operations of $751 million and $707 million in the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Table 10 summarizes the financial results of our Credit Card business and displays selected key metrics for the periods indicated.

Total net revenue was reduced by $376 million and $335 million in the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 , respectively, for the estimated uncollectible amount of billed finance charges and fees and related losses. The finance charge and fee reserve totaled $461 million and $468 million as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , respectively. 18 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents (2) Period-end loans held for investment and average loans held for investment include billed finance charges and fees, net of the estimated uncollectible amount. (3) Average yield on loans held for investment is calculated by dividing annualized interest income for the period by average loans held for investment during the period. Interest income excludes various allocations including funds transfer pricing that assigns certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses attributable to each business segment. (4) Total net revenue margin is calculated by dividing annualized total net revenue for the period by average loans held for investment during the period. Interest income also includes interest income on loans held for sale. (5) Purchase volume consists of purchase transactions, net of returns, for the period, and excludes cash advance and balance transfer transactions. (6) Within our credit card loan portfolio, only certain loans in our international card businesses are classified as nonperforming. See MD&A Nonperforming Loans and Other Nonperforming Assets for additional information. Key factors affecting the results of our Credit Card business for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 , and changes in financial condition and credit performance between March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 include the following: Net Interest Income: Net interest income increased by $32 million to $3.6 billion in the first quarter of 2019 primarily driven by growth in our domestic credit card loan portfolio . Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income increased by $93 million to $950 million in the first quarter of 2019 primarily due to an increase in net interchange fees, driven by higher purchase volume and the impact of updated rewards cost estimates . Provision for Credit Losses: The provision for credit losses decreased by $67 million to $1.4 billion in the first quarter of 2019 primarily driven by smaller allowance build as compared to the the first quarter of 2018 . Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense increased by $132 million to $2.2 billion in the first quarter of 2019 , primarily driven by increased marketing expense as well as Walmart partnership and related expenses. Loans Held for Investment: Period-end loans held for investment decreased by $6.5 billion to $109.8 billion as of March 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 primarily due to expected seasonal paydowns. Average loans held for investment increased by $2.0 billion to $111.5 billion in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to growth in our domestic credit card loan portfolio. Net Charge-Off and Delinquency Metrics: The net charge-off rate decreased by 13 basis points to 4.90% in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 primarily driven by favorability realized from portfolio seasoning . The 30+ day delinquency rate decreased by 29 basis points to 3.72% as of March 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 primarily due to seasonally lower delinquency inventories in our domestic credit card loan portfolio. Domestic Card Business The Domestic Card business generated net income from continuing operations of $695 million and $607 million in the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 , respectively. In the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 , Domestic Card accounted for greater than 90% of total net revenue of our Credit Card business. 19 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 10.1 summarizes the financial results for Domestic Card and displays selected key metrics for the periods indicated.

(5) Purchase volume consists of purchase transactions, net of returns, for the period, and excludes cash advance and balance transfer transactions. Because our Domestic Card business accounts for the substantial majority of our Credit Card business, the key factors driving the results are similar to the key factors affecting our total Credit Card business. Net income for our Domestic Card business increased in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 primarily driven by: higher non-interest income due to an increase in net interchange fees, driven by higher purchase volume and the impact of updated rewards cost estimates ; lower provision for credit losses due to a small allowance release as compared to an allowance build; and higher net interest income due to portfolio growth. These drivers were partially offset by increased marketing expense as well as Walmart partnership and related expenses. 20 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Consumer Banking Business The primary sources of revenue for our Consumer Banking business are net interest income from loans and deposits and non-interest income from service charges and customer-related fees. Expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating costs and marketing expenses.

Key factors affecting the results of our Consumer Banking business for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 , and changes in financial condition and credit performance between March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 include the following: Net Interest Income: Net interest income increased by $64 million to $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2019 primarily driven by higher deposit volumes and margins in our Retail Banking business as well as growth in our auto loan portfolio, partially offset by the reduction in net interest income from the sale of our consumer home loan portfolio. Consumer Banking loan yield increased by 129 basis points to 8.15% in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 . The increase was primarily driven by: changes in product mix as a result of the sale of our consumer home loan portfolio; and higher yields as a result of higher interest rates. Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income decreased by $14 million to $160 million in the first quarter of 2019 primarily driven by the impact of the sale of our online retail brokerage business in the fourth quarter of 2018. Provision for Credit Losses: The provision for credit losses was substantially flat at $235 million in the first quarter of 2019 . Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense was substantially flat at $1.0 billion in the first quarter of 2019 primarily driven by lower operating expense due to our decision to cease new originations of home loan lending products in the fourth quarter of 2017, largely offset by higher marketing expense. Loans Held for Investment: Period-end loans held for investment remained flat at $59.2 billion as of March 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018 . Average loans held for investment decreased by $15.9 billion to $59.1 billion in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 primarily driven by the sale of our consumer home loan portfolio, partially offset by growth in our auto loan portfolio. Deposits: Period-end deposits increased by $6.8 billion to $205.4 billion as of March 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 driven by strong growth in our deposit products as a result of our national banking growth strategy . Net Charge-Off and Delinquency Metrics: The net charge-off rate increased by 30 basis points to 1.49% in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 primarily driven by lower loan balances due to the sale of our consumer home loan portfolio. The 30+ day delinquency rate decreased by 134 basis points to 6.02% as of March 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 primarily attributable to seasonally lower auto delinquency inventories. Commercial Banking Business The primary sources of revenue for our Commercial Banking business are net interest income from loans and deposits and non-interest income from customer fees and other products and services. Because our Commercial Banking business has loans and investments that generate tax-exempt income, tax credits or other tax benefits, we present the revenues on a taxable-equivalent basis. Expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating costs and marketing expenses. Our Commercial Banking business generated net income from continuing operations of $146 million and $233 million in the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 , respectively. 22 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 12 summarizes the financial results of our Commercial Banking business and displays selected key metrics for the periods indicated.

Accordingly, we present our Commercial Banking revenue and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated using the federal statutory tax rate of 21% and state taxes where applicable, with offsetting reductions to the Other category. (2) In the first quarter of 2019, we made a change in how revenue is measured in our Commercial Banking business by revising the allocation of tax benefits on certain tax-advantaged investments. As such, prior period results have been recast to conform with the current period presentation. The result of this measurement change reduced the previously reported total net revenue in our Commercial Banking business by $30 million for the first quarter of 2018, with an offsetting increase in the Other category. 23 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents (3) The provision for losses on unfunded lending commitments is included in the provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of income and the related reserve for unfunded lending commitments is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Our reserve for unfunded lending commitments totaled $127 million and $118 million as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , respectively. (4) Average yield on loans held for investment is calculated by dividing annualized interest income for the period by average loans held for investment during the period. Interest income excludes various allocations including funds transfer pricing that assigns certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses attributable to each business segment. (5) Nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans, REO and other foreclosed assets. The total nonperforming asset rate is calculated based on total nonperforming assets divided by the combined period-end total loans held for investment, REO and other foreclosed assets. ** Not meaningful. Key factors affecting the results of our Commercial Banking business for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 , and changes in financial condition and credit performance between March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 include the following: Net Interest Income: Net interest income decreased by $17 million to $489 million in the first quarter of 2019 primarily driven by lower average deposit balances and lower loan margins, partially offset by growth across our commercial loan portfolios. Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income remained flat at $187 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018. Provision for Credit Losses: Provision for credit losses increased to $69 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to a benefit of $14 million in the first quarter of 2018, primarily driven by an allowance build associated with some isolated credit deterioration and portfolio growth. Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense increased by $14 million to $417 million in the first quarter of 2019 primarily driven by higher operating expenses associated with continued investments in technology and other business initiatives. Loans Held for Investment: Period-end loans held for investment increased by $856 million to $71.2 billion as of March 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 , and average loans held for investment increased by $6.3 billion to $71.4 billion in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 , both primarily driven by growth across our commercial loan portfolios. Deposits: Period-end deposits increased by $1.8 billion to $31.2 billion as of March 31, 2019 , from December 31, 2018 primarily driven by new business growth. Net Charge-Off and Nonperforming Metrics: The net charge-off rate decreased by 3 basis points to 0.08% in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 . The nonperforming loan rate increased by 9 basis points to 0.53% as of March 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 primarily driven by some isolated credit deterioration. Other Category Other includes unallocated amounts related to our centralized Corporate Treasury group activities, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio, asset/liability management and certain capital management activities. Other also includes: unallocated corporate revenue and expenses that do not directly support the operations of the business segments or for which the business segments are not considered financially accountable in evaluating their performance, such as certain restructuring charges; offsets related to certain line-item reclassifications; residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate that is not assessed to our primary business segments ; and foreign exchange-rate fluctuations on foreign currency-denominated balances. 24 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 13 summarizes the financial results of our Other category for the periods indicated.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make a number of judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses on the consolidated financial statements. Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We provide a summary of our significant accounting policies under Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our 2018 Form 10-K. We have identified the following accounting policies as critical because they require significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. These critical accounting policies govern: Loan loss reserves Asset impairment Fair value of financial instruments Customer rewards reserve We evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and update them as necessary, based on changing conditions. There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates described in our 2018 Form 10-K under MD&A Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. 25 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents ACCOUNTING CHANGES AND DEVELOPMENTS See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for information on the accounting standards we adopted in 2019 and the expected impacts of accounting standards issued but not adopted as of March 31, 2019. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The level and composition of our capital are determined by multiple factors, including our consolidated regulatory capital requirements and internal risk-based capital assessments such as internal stress testing and economic capital. The level and composition of our capital may also be influenced by rating agency guidelines, subsidiary capital requirements, business environment, conditions in the financial markets and assessments of potential future losses due to adverse changes in our business and market environments. Capital Standards and Prompt Corrective Action We are subject to capital adequacy standards adopted by the Federal Banking Agencies, including the Basel III Capital Rule. Moreover, the Banks, as insured depository institutions, are subject to Prompt Corrective Action ( PCA ) capital regulations. We entered parallel run under Basel III Advanced Approaches on January 1, 2015, during which we are required to calculate capital ratios under both the Basel III Standardized Approach and the Basel III Advanced Approaches, though we continue to use the Standardized Approach for purposes of meeting regulatory capital requirements. Under the Basel III Capital Rule, when we complete our parallel run for the Advanced Approaches, our minimum risk-based capital requirement will be determined by the greater of our risk-weighted assets under the Basel III Standardized Approach and the Basel III Advanced Approaches. Once we exit parallel run, based on clarification of the Basel III Capital Rule from our regulators, any amount by which our expected credit losses exceed eligible credit reserves, as each term is defined under the Basel III Capital Rule, will be deducted from our Basel III Standardized Approach numerator, subject to transition provisions. Inclusive of this impact, based on current capital rules and our business mix, we estimate that our Basel III Advanced Approaches ratios will be lower than our Basel III Standardized Approach ratios. However, there is uncertainty whether this will remain the case, or whether we remain subject to the Basel III Advanced Approaches, and in light of potential changes to the United States capital rules. The Basel III Capital Rule also introduced the supplementary leverage ratio for all Advanced Approaches banking organizations with a minimum requirement of 3.0%. The supplementary leverage ratio compares Tier 1 capital to total leverage exposure, which includes all on-balance sheet assets and certain off-balance sheet exposures, including derivatives and unused commitments. Given that we are in our Basel III Advanced Approaches parallel run, we calculate the ratio based on Tier 1 capital under the Standardized Approach. The Market Risk Rule supplements both the Basel III Standardized Approach and the Basel III Advanced Approaches by requiring institutions subject to the Market Risk Rule to adjust their risk-based capital ratios to reflect the market risk in their trading portfolios. As of March 31, 2019 , the Company and CONA are subject to the Market Risk Rule. See MD&A Market Risk Profile below for additional information. For the description of the regulatory capital rules we are subject to, see Part I Item 1. Business Supervision and Regulation in our 2018 Form 10-K. 26 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 14 provides a comparison of our regulatory capital ratios under the Basel III Standardized Approach, the regulatory minimum capital adequacy ratios and the PCA well-capitalized level for each ratio, where applicable, as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 .

The Company exceeded the minimum capital requirements and each of the Banks exceeded the minimum regulatory requirements and were well capitalized under PCA requirements as of both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . The Basel III Capital Rule requires banks to maintain a capital conservation buffer, composed of common equity Tier 1 capital, of 2.5% above the regulatory minimum ratios. For banks subject to the Advanced Approaches, including the Company and the Banks, the capital conservation buffer may be supplemented by an incremental countercyclical capital buffer of up to 2.5% composed of common equity Tier 1 capital and set at the discretion of the Federal Banking Agencies. As of March 31, 2019, the countercyclical capital buffer was zero percent in the United States. A determination to increase the countercyclical capital buffer generally would be effective twelve months after the announcement of such an increase, unless the Federal Banking Agencies set an earlier effective date. For 2019, the minimum capital requirement plus capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer for common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios is 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5%, respectively, for the Company and the Banks. A common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio, or total capital ratio below the applicable regulatory minimum ratio plus the applicable capital conservation buffer and the applicable countercyclical buffer (if set to an amount greater than zero percent) might restrict a bank ability to distribute capital and make discretionary bonus payments. As of March 31, 2019, the Company and each of the Banks were all above the applicable combined thresholds. Capital Planning and Regulatory Stress Testing On April 5, 2019, we submitted our capital plan to the Federal Reserve as part of the 2019 CCAR cycle. The stress testing results are expected to be released by the Federal Reserve before June 30, 2019. 28 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents On June 28, 2018, the Federal Reserve informed us that they had no objection to our CCAR 2018 Capital Plan submission. As a result of this non-objection to our capital plan, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.2 billion of shares of our common stock beginning in the third quarter of 2018 through the end of the second quarter of 2019, which we completed in the fourth quarter of 2018. The Board of Directors also authorized the quarterly dividend on our common stock of $0.40 per share. For the description of the regulatory capital planning rules we are subject to, see Part I Item 1. Business Supervision and Regulation in our 2018 Form 10-K. Dividend Policy and Stock Purchases In the first quarter of 2019 , we declared and paid common stock dividends of $194 million , or $0.40 per share, and preferred stock dividends of $52 million . The following table summarizes the dividends paid per share on our various preferred stock series in the first quarter of 2019 .

As a bank holding company ( BHC ), our ability to pay dividends is largely dependent upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries. Regulatory restrictions exist that limit the ability of the Banks to transfer funds to our BHC. As of March 31, 2019 , funds available for dividend payments from COBNA and CONA were $2.6 billion and $3.8 billion , respectively. There can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends to stockholders. Consistent with our 2018 Stock Repurchase Program, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.2 billion of shares of common stock beginning in the third quarter of 2018 through the end of the second quarter of 2019. We completed the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program in the fourth quarter of 2018. The timing and exact amount of any future common stock repurchases will depend on various factors, including regulatory approval, market conditions, opportunities for growth, our capital position and the amount of retained earnings. Our stock repurchase program does not include specific price targets, may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including utilizing Rule 10b5-1 programs, and may be suspended at any time. For additional information on dividends and stock repurchases, see Part I Item 1. Business Supervision and Regulation Dividends, Stock Repurchases and Transfers of Funds in our 2018 Form 10-K. RISK MANAGEMENT Risk Framework We use a risk framework to provide an overall enterprise-wide approach for effectively managing risk. We execute against our risk framework with the Three Lines of Defense risk management model to demonstrate and structure the roles, responsibilities and accountabilities in the organization for taking and managing risk. 29 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents The First Line of Defense is comprised of the business areas that through their day-to-day business activities take risk on our behalf. As the business owner, the first line is responsible for identifying, assessing, managing and controlling that risk. This principle places ultimate accountability for the management of risks and ownership of risk decisions with the CEO and business heads. The Second Line of Defense provides oversight of first line risk taking and management, and is primarily comprised of our Risk Management organization. The second line assists in determining risk appetite and the strategies, policies and structures for managing risks. The second line is both an expert advisor to the first line and an effective challenger of first line risk activities. The Third Line of Defense is comprised of our Internal Audit and Credit Review functions. The third line provides independent and objective assurance to senior management and to the Board of Directors that first and second line risk management and internal control systems and its governance processes are well-designed and working as intended. The risk framework is also used to guide design of risk programs and performance of risk activity within each risk category and across the entire enterprise. There are eight elements that comprise the risk framework: Establish Governance Processes, Accountabilities and Risk Appetites Identify and Assess Risks and Ownership Develop and Operate Controls, Monitoring and Mitigation Plans Test and Detect Control Gaps and Perform Corrective Action Escalate Key Risks and Gaps to Executive Management and, when Appropriate, the Board of Directors Calculate and Allocate Capital in Alignment with Risk Management and Measurement Processes (including Stress Testing) Support with the Right Culture, Talent and Skills Enabled by the Right Data, Infrastructure and Programs We provide additional discussion of our risk management principles, roles and responsibilities, framework and risk appetite under MD&A Risk Management in our 2018 Form 10-K. CREDIT RISK PROFILE Our loan portfolio accounts for the substantial majority of our credit risk exposure. Our lending activities are governed under our credit policy and are subject to independent review and approval. Below we provide information about the composition of our loan portfolio, key concentrations and credit performance metrics. We also engage in certain non-lending activities that may give rise to credit and counterparty settlement risk, including purchasing securities for our investment securities portfolio, entering into derivative transactions to manage our market risk exposure and to accommodate customers, extending short-term advances on syndication activity (including bridge financing transactions we have underwritten), depositing certain operational cash balances in other financial institutions, executing certain foreign exchange transactions and extending customer overdrafts. We provide additional information on credit risk related to our investment securities portfolio under MD&A Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis Investment Securities and credit risk related to derivative transactions in Note 9 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities . 30 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Loans Held for Investment Portfolio Composition We provide a variety of lending products. Our primary products include credit cards, auto loans and commercial lending products. We sold all of our consumer home loan portfolio and the related servicing during 2018. For information on our lending policies and procedures, including our underwriting criteria for our primary loan products, see MD&A Credit Risk Profile in our 2018 Form 10-K. Our loan portfolio consists of loans held for investment, including loans held in our consolidated trusts, and loans held for sale. Table 17 presents the composition of our portfolio of loans held for investment by portfolio segment as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . Table 17 and the credit metrics presented in this section exclude loans held for sale, which are carried at lower of cost or fair value and totaled $905 million and $1.2 billion as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , respectively.

Key metrics we track in evaluating the credit quality of our loan portfolio include delinquency and nonperforming asset rates, as well as net charge-off rates and our internal risk ratings of larger-balance commercial loans. Trends in delinquency rates are one of the primary indicators of credit risk within our consumer loan portfolios, particularly in our credit card loan portfolios, as changes in delinquency rates can provide an early warning of changes in credit losses. The primary indicator of credit risk in our commercial loan portfolios is our internal risk ratings. Because we generally classify loans that have been delinquent for an extended period of time and other loans with significant risk of loss as nonperforming, the level of nonperforming assets represents another indicator of the potential for future credit losses. In addition to delinquency rates, the geographic distribution of our loans provides insight as to the exposure of the portfolio to regional economic conditions. We underwrite most consumer loans using proprietary models, which are typically based on credit bureau data, including borrower credit scores, along with application information and, where applicable, collateral and deal structure data. We continuously adjust our management of credit lines and collection strategies based on customer behavior and risk profile changes. We also use borrower credit scores for subprime classification, for competitive benchmarking and, in some cases, to drive product segmentation decisions. 32 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 19 provides details on the credit scores of our domestic credit card and auto loans held for investment portfolios as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 .

Domestic card credit scores generally represent FICO scores. These scores are obtained from one of the major credit bureaus at origination and are refreshed monthly thereafter. We approximate non-FICO credit scores to comparable FICO scores for consistency purposes. Balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 660 or below category. (2) Percentages represent period-end loans held for investment in each credit score category. Auto credit scores generally represent average FICO scores obtained from three credit bureaus at the time of application and are not refreshed thereafter. Balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 620 or below category. We present information in the section below on the credit performance of our loan portfolio, including the key metrics we use in tracking changes in the credit quality of our loan portfolio. See Note 4 Loans in this Report for additional credit quality information, and see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our 2018 Form 10-K for information on our accounting policies for delinquent and nonperforming loans, charge-offs and troubled debt restructurings ( TDRs ) for each of our loan categories. Delinquency Rates We consider the entire balance of an account to be delinquent if the minimum required payment is not received by the customer due date, measured at each balance sheet date. Our 30+ day delinquency metrics include all loans held for investment that are 30 or more days past due, whereas our 30+ day performing delinquency metrics include loans that are 30 or more days past due but are currently classified as performing and accruing interest. The 30+ day delinquency and 30+ day performing delinquency metrics are the same for domestic credit card loans, as we continue to classify these loans as performing until the account is charged off, typically when the account is 180 days past due. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our 2018 Form 10-K for information on our policies for classifying loans as nonperforming for each of our loan categories. We provide additional information on our credit quality metrics above under MD&A Business Segment Financial Performance . 33 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 20 presents our 30+ day performing delinquency rates and 30+ day delinquency rates of our portfolio of loans held for investment, by portfolio segment, as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 .

These loans consist primarily of credit card accounts between 90 days and 179 days past due. As permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, we continue to accrue interest and fees on domestic credit card loans through the date of charge-off, which is typically in the period the account becomes 180 days past due. While domestic credit card loans typically remain on accrual status until the loan is charged off, we reduce the balance of our credit card receivables by the amount of finance charges and fees billed but not expected to be collected and exclude this amount from revenue.

Nonperforming Loans and Nonperforming Assets Nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans, foreclosed properties, and repossessed assets. Nonperforming loans include loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our 2018 Form 10-K for information on our policies for classifying loans as nonperforming for each of our loan categories. Table 23 presents comparative information on nonperforming loans, by portfolio segment, and other nonperforming assets as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . We do not classify loans held for sale as nonperforming, as they are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. We provide additional information on our credit quality metrics above under MD&A Business Segment Financial Performance . 35 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 23 : Nonperforming Loans and Other Nonperforming Assets (1) March 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 (Dollars in millions) Amount Rate Amount Rate Nonperforming loans held for investment: (2) Credit Card: International card businesses $ 23 0.26 % $ 22 0.25 % Total credit card 23 0.02 22 0.02 Consumer Banking: Auto 321 0.57 449 0.80 Retail banking 31 1.10 30 1.04 Total consumer banking 352 0.59 479 0.81 Commercial Banking: Commercial and multifamily real estate 69 0.24 83 0.29 Commercial and industrial 301 0.71 223 0.54 Total commercial lending 370 0.52 306 0.44 Small-ticket commercial real estate 8 ** 6 1.80 Total commercial banking 378 0.53 312 0.44 Total nonperforming loans held for investment (3) $ 753 0.31 $ 813 0.33 Other nonperforming assets: (4) Foreclosed property $ 2 $ 2 Other assets 50 0.02 57 0.02 Total other nonperforming assets 52 0.02 59 0.02 Total nonperforming assets $ 805 0.33 $ 872 0.35 __________ (1) We recognized interest income for loans classified as nonperforming of $2 million in both the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 . Interest income foregone related to nonperforming loans was $22 million and $18 million in the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Foregone interest income represents the amount of interest income in excess of recognized interest income that would have been recorded during the period for nonperforming loans as of the end of the period had the loans performed according to their contractual terms. (2) Nonperforming loan rates are calculated based on nonperforming loans for each category divided by period-end total loans held for investment for each respective category. (3) Excluding the impact of domestic credit card loans, nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans held for investment was 0.54% and 0.59% as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , respectively. (4) The denominators used in calculating nonperforming asset rates consist of total loans held for investment and total other nonperforming assets. ** Not meaningful. 36 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Net Charge-Offs Net charge-offs consist of the unpaid principal balance of loans held for investment that we determine to be uncollectible, net of recovered amounts. We charge off loans as a reduction to the allowance for loan and lease losses when we determine the loan is uncollectible and record subsequent recoveries of previously charged-off amounts as increases to the allowance for loan and lease losses. Uncollectible finance charges and fees are reversed through revenue and certain fraud losses are recorded in other non-interest expense. Generally, costs to recover charged-off loans are recorded as collection expenses as incurred and included in our consolidated statements of income as a component of other non-interest expense. Our charge-off policy for loans varies based on the loan type. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our 2018 Form 10-K for information on our charge-off policy for each of our loan categories. Table 24 presents our net charge-off amounts and rates, by portfolio segment, in the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 .

Table 25 presents our recorded investment of loans modified in TDRs as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , which excludes loan modifications that do not meet the definition of a TDR, and PCI loans, which we track and report separately.

The effective interest rate in effect immediately prior to the loan modification is used as the effective interest rate for purposes of measuring impairment using the present value of expected cash flows. If the customer does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan agreement may revert to its original payment terms, generally resulting in any loan outstanding reflected in the appropriate delinquency category and charged off in accordance with our standard charge-off policy. In our Consumer Banking business, the majority of our loans modified in TDRs receive an extension, an interest rate reduction or principal reduction, or a combination of these concessions. In addition, TDRs also occur in connection with bankruptcy of the borrower. In certain bankruptcy discharges, the loan is written down to the collateral value and the charged-off amount is reported as principal reduction. Impairment is determined using the present value of expected cash flows or a collateral evaluation for certain auto and home loans where the collateral value is lower than the recorded investment. In our Commercial Banking business, the majority of loans modified in TDRs receive an extension, with a portion of these loans receiving an interest rate reduction or a gross balance reduction. The impairment on modified commercial loans is generally determined based on the underlying collateral value. We provide additional information on modified loans accounted for as TDRs, including the performance of those loans subsequent to modification, in Note 4 Loans . Impaired Loans A loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due from the borrower in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan. Generally, we report loans as impaired based on the method for measuring impairment in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. Loans defined as individually impaired include larger-balance commercial nonperforming loans and TDRs. Loans held for sale are not reported as impaired, as these loans are recorded at lower of cost or fair value. Impaired loans also exclude PCI loans, which are accounted for based on expected cash flows because this accounting methodology takes into consideration future credit losses expected to be incurred. 38 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Impaired loans totaled $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , respectively. These amounts include TDRs of $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , respectively. We provide additional information on our impaired loans, including the allowance for loan and lease losses established for these loans, in Note 4 Loans and Note 5 Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments . Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments Our allowance for loan and lease losses represents management best estimate of incurred loan and lease credit losses inherent to our held for investment portfolio as of each balance sheet date. The allowance for loan and lease losses is increased through the provision for credit losses and reduced by net charge-offs. We provide additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used in determining our allowance for loan and lease losses under Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our 2018 Form 10-K. Table 26 presents changes in our allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 , and details by portfolio segment for the provision for credit losses, charge-offs and recoveries. 39 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 26 : Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments Activity Credit Card Consumer Banking (Dollars in millions) Domestic Card International Card Businesses Total Credit Card Auto Retail Banking Total Consumer Banking Commercial Banking Total Allowance for loan and lease losses: Balance as of December 31, 2018 $ 5,144 $ 391 $ 5,535 $ 990 $ 58 $ 1,048 $ 637 $ 7,220 Charge-offs (1,652 ) (130 ) (1,782 ) (449 ) (22 ) (471 ) (20 ) (2,273 ) Recoveries (1) 358 60 418 246 4 250 6 674 Net charge-offs (1,294 ) (70 ) (1,364 ) (203 ) (18 ) (221 ) (14 ) (1,599 ) Provision for loan and lease losses 1,291 98 1,389 215 20 235 60 1,684 Allowance build (release) for loan and lease losses (3 ) 28 25 12 2 14 46 85 Other changes (2) 8 8 8 Balance as of March 31, 2019 5,141 427 5,568 1,002 60 1,062 683 7,313 Reserve for unfunded lending commitments: Balance as of December 31, 2018 4 4 118 122 Provision for losses on unfunded lending commitments 9 9 Balance as of March 31, 2019 4 4 127 131 Combined allowance and reserve as of March 31, 2019 $ 5,141 $ 427 $ 5,568 $ 1,002 $ 64 $ 1,066 $ 810 $ 7,444 Credit Card Consumer Banking (Dollars in millions) Domestic Card International Card Businesses Total Credit Card Auto Home Loan Retail Banking Total Consumer Banking Commercial Banking Other (3) Total Allowance for loan and lease losses: Balance as of December 31, 2017 $ 5,273 $ 375 $ 5,648 $ 1,119 $ 58 $ 65 $ 1,242 $ 611 $ 1 $ 7,502 Charge-offs (1,697 ) (128 ) (1,825 ) (410 ) (21 ) (431 ) (21 ) 1 (2,276 ) Recoveries (1) 376 72 448 202 1 5 208 2 658 Net charge-offs (1,321 ) (56 ) (1,377 ) (208 ) 1 (16 ) (223 ) (19 ) 1 (1,618 ) Provision (benefit) for loan and lease losses 1,380 76 1,456 226 (6 ) 14 234 (5 ) (1 ) 1,684 Allowance build (release) for loan and lease losses 59 20 79 18 (5 ) (2 ) 11 (24 ) 66 Other changes (2) (1 ) (1 ) (1 ) Balance as of March 31, 2018 5,332 394 5,726 1,137 53 63 1,253 587 1 7,567 Reserve for unfunded lending commitments: Balance as of December 31, 2017 7 7 117 124 Benefit for losses on unfunded lending commitments (1 ) (1 ) (9 ) (10 ) Balance as of March 31, 2018 6 6 108 114 Combined allowance and reserve as of March 31, 2018 $ 5,332 $ 394 $ 5,726 $ 1,137 $ 53 $ 69 $ 1,259 $ 695 $ 1 $ 7,681 __________ (1) The amount and timing of recoveries is impacted by our collection strategies, which are based on customer behavior and risk profile and include direct customer communications, repossession of collateral, the periodic sale of charged-off loans as well as additional strategies, such as litigation.

Our allowance for loan and lease losses increased by $93 million to $7.3 billion as of March 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018 primarily driven by an allowance build in our commercial loan portfolio due to isolated credit deterioration and portfolio growth. The allowance coverage ratio increased by 10 basis points to 3.04% as of March 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 primarily driven by expected seasonal paydowns in our domestic credit card loan portfolio. LIQUIDITY RISK PROFILE We have established liquidity practices that are intended to ensure that we have sufficient asset-based liquidity to cover our funding requirements and maintain adequate reserves to withstand the potential impact of deposit attrition or diminished liquidity in the funding markets. In addition to our cash position, we maintain reserves in the form of available for sale securities, held to maturity securities and certain loans that are either readily-marketable or pledgeable. Table 28 below presents the composition of our liquidity reserves as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . Table 28 : Liquidity Reserves (Dollars in millions) March 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Cash and cash equivalents $ 17,469 $ 13,186 Investment securities portfolio: Investment securities available for sale, at fair value 45,888 46,150 Investment securities held to maturity, at fair value 36,955 36,619 Total investment securities portfolio 82,843 82,769 FHLB borrowing capacity secured by loans 9,560 10,003 Outstanding FHLB advances and letters of credit secured by loans (393 ) (9,726 ) Investment securities encumbered for Public Funds and others (6,286 ) (6,631 ) Total liquidity reserves $ 103,193 $ 89,601 Our liquidity reserves increased by $13.6 billion to $103.2 billion as of March 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 primarily driven by a decrease in our FHLB advances outstanding and an increase in our cash and cash equivalents balance. See MD&A Risk Management in our 2018 Form 10-K for additional information on our management of liquidity risk. 41 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Liquidity Coverage Ratio We are subject to the Liquidity Coverage Ratio Rule ( LCR Rule ) as implemented by the Federal Reserve and OCC. The LCR Rule requires us to calculate our LCR daily and to publicly disclose, on a quarterly basis, our LCR, certain related quantitative liquidity metrics, and a qualitative discussion of our LCR. Our average LCR during the first quarter of 2019 exceeded the LCR requirement of 100%. The calculation and the underlying components are based on our interpretations, expectations and assumptions of relevant regulations, as well as interpretations provided by our regulators, and are subject to change based on changes to future regulations and interpretations. See Part I Item 1. Business Supervision and Regulation in our 2018 Form 10-K for additional information. Borrowing Capacity We maintain a shelf registration with the SEC so that we may periodically offer and sell an indeterminate aggregate amount of senior or subordinated debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock, purchase contracts, warrants and units. There is no limit under this shelf registration to the amount or number of such securities that we may offer and sell, subject to market conditions. In addition, we also maintain a shelf registration that allows us to periodically offer and sell up to $25 billion of securitized debt obligations from our credit card loan securitization trust and a shelf registration that allows us to periodically offer and sell up to $20 billion in securitized auto loans. In addition to our issuance capacity under the shelf registration statements, we also have access to FHLB advances. The ability to draw down funding is based on membership status and the amount is dependent upon the Banks ability to post collateral. As of March 31, 2019 , we pledged both loans and securities to FHLB to secure a maximum borrowing capacity of $18.8 billion , of which $18.4 billion was still available to us to borrow. Our FHLB membership is supported by our investment in FHLB stock of $30 million and $415 million as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , respectively, which was determined in part based on our outstanding advances. In addition, we have access to the Federal Reserve Discount Window through which we had a borrowing capacity of $7.0 billion as of March 31, 2019 . Our membership with the Federal Reserve is supported by our investment in Federal Reserve stock, totaling $1.3 billion as of both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . Funding Our primary source of funding comes from deposits, as they are a stable and relatively low cost source of funding. In addition to deposits, we raise funding through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, securitized debt obligations and brokered deposits, as well as federal funds purchased, securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, and FHLB advances secured by certain portions of our loan and securities portfolios. A key objective in our use of these markets is to maintain access to a diversified mix of wholesale funding sources. See MD&A Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis Funding Sources Composition for additional information on our primary sources of funding. 42 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Deposits Table 29 provides a comparison of average balances, interest expense and average deposit interest rates for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 .

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) limits the acceptance of brokered deposits by well-capitalized insured depository institutions and, with a waiver from the FDIC, by adequately-capitalized institutions. COBNA and CONA were well-capitalized, as defined under the federal banking regulatory guidelines, as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , respectively. See Part I Item 1. Business Supervision and Regulation in our 2018 Form 10-K for additional information. We provide additional information on the composition of deposits under MD&A Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis Funding Sources Composition and in Note 8 Deposits and Borrowings . Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt We access the capital markets to meet our funding needs through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, securitized debt obligations, and federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. In addition, we may utilize short-term and long-term FHLB advances secured by certain of our investment securities, multifamily real estate loans, and commercial real estate loans. Our short-term borrowings include those borrowings with an original contractual maturity of one year or less and do not include the current portion of long-term debt. The short-term borrowings, which consist of short-term FHLB advances and federal funds purchased, securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, decreased by $9.1 billion to $335 million as of March 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 driven by maturities of our short-term FHLB advances. Our long-term debt, which primarily consists of securitized debt obligations, senior and subordinated notes, and long-term FHLB advances, increased by $520 million to $50.0 billion as of March 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018 , primarily driven by securitized debt issuances outpacing maturities. 43 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents The following table summarizes issuances of securitized debt obligations, senior and subordinated notes, and FHLB advances and their respective maturities or redemptions for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 .

MARKET RISK PROFILE Market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities, including loans, deposits, securities, short-term borrowings, long-term debt and derivatives. Below we provide additional information about our primary sources of market risk, our market risk management strategies and the measures we use to evaluate our market risk exposure. Primary Market Risk Exposures Our primary source of market risk is interest rate risk. We also have exposure to foreign exchange risk and commodity risk, both of which we believe are minimal after considering the impact of our associated risk management activities discussed below. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk, which represents exposure to instruments whose yield or price varies with the volatility of interest rates, is our most significant source of market risk exposure. Banks are inevitably exposed to interest rate risk due to differences in the timing between the maturities or re-pricing of assets and liabilities. 44 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Foreign Exchange Risk Foreign exchange risk represents exposure to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in other currencies. Our primary exposure to foreign exchange risk is related to the operations of our international businesses in the U.K. and Canada. The largest foreign exchange exposure arising from these operations is the funding they are provided in the Great British pound ( GBP ) and the Canadian dollar ( CAD ), respectively. We also have foreign exchange exposure through our net equity investments in these operations and through the dollar-denominated value of future earnings and cash flows they generate. Our intercompany funding exposes our consolidated statements of income to foreign exchange transaction risk, while our equity investments in our foreign operations result in translation risk exposure in our AOCI and capital ratios. We manage our transaction risk by entering into forward foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to variability in cash flows related to foreign currency-denominated intercompany borrowings. We use foreign currency derivative contracts as net investment hedges to manage our AOCI exposure. We apply hedge accounting to both our intercompany funding hedges and our net investment hedges, with the primary net investments subject to hedging denominated in GBP. We measure our total exposure from non-dollar-denominated intercompany borrowings to our international businesses by regularly tracking the value of the loans made to our foreign operations and the associated forward foreign currency derivative contracts we use to hedge them. We apply a 1% U.S. dollar appreciation shock against these exposures to measure the impact to our consolidated statements of income from foreign exchange transaction risk. The intercompany borrowings to our international businesses were 722 million GBP and 756 million GBP as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , respectively, and 6.1 billion CAD and 6.5 billion CAD as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , respectively. We measure our total exposure in non-dollar-denominated equity by regularly tracking the value of net equity invested in our foreign operations largely in the U.K. and Canada. Our measurement of net equity includes the impact of net investment hedges where applicable. We apply a 30% U.S. dollar appreciation shock against these net investment exposures, which we believe approximates a significant adverse foreign exchange movement over a one-year time horizon. Our gross equity exposures in our U.K. and Canadian operations were 1.7 billion GBP and 1.6 billion GBP as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , respectively, and 1.2 billion CAD as of both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . As a result of our derivative management activities, we believe our net exposure to foreign exchange risk is minimal. Risk related to Customer Accommodation Derivatives We offer various interest rate, commodity and foreign currency derivatives as accommodation to our customers within our Commercial Banking business and offset the majority of these exposures through derivative transactions with other counterparties. These exposures are measured and monitored on a daily basis. As a result of offsetting our customer exposures with other counterparties, we believe our net exposure to customer accommodation derivatives is minimal. We employ value-at-risk ( VaR ) as the primary method to both measure and monitor the market risk in our customer accommodation derivative activities. VaR is a statistical-based risk measure used to estimate the potential loss from adverse market movements in a normal market environment. We employ a historical simulation approach using the most recent 500 business days and use a 99 percent confidence level and a holding period of one business day. We use internal models to produce a daily VaR measure of the market risk of all customer accommodation derivative exposures. For further information on our customer-related trading exposures, see Note 9 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities . Market Risk Management We employ several techniques to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk, which include, but are not limited to, altering the duration and re-pricing characteristics of our various assets and liabilities and mitigating the foreign exchange exposure of certain non-dollar-denominated equity or transactions. Derivatives are the primary tools that we use for managing interest rate and foreign exchange risk. Use of derivatives is included in our current market risk management policies. We execute our derivative contracts in both over-the-counter and exchange-traded derivative markets and have exposure to both bilateral and clearinghouse counterparties. Although the majority of our derivatives are interest rate swaps, we can also use a variety of other derivative instruments, including caps, floors, options, futures and forward contracts, to manage our risk exposures, which are primarily interest rate, foreign currency and commodity risk. The outstanding notional amount of our derivative contracts increased to $219.0 billion as of March 31, 2019 from $212.5 billion as of December 31, 2018 primarily driven by an increase in our hedging and customer accommodation activities. 45 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Market Risk Measurement We have risk management policies and limits established by our market risk management policies and approved by the Board of Directors. Our objective is to manage our asset and liability risk position and exposure to market risk in accordance with these policies and prescribed limits based on prevailing market conditions and long-term expectations. Because no single measure can reflect all aspects of market risk, we use various industry standard market risk measurement techniques and analysis to measure, assess and manage the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and our economic value of equity and the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our non-dollar-denominated earnings and non-dollar equity investments in foreign operations. We provide additional information below in Economic Value of Equity. We consider the impact on both net interest income and economic value of equity in measuring and managing our interest rate risk. In instances where a 200 basis points decrease in rates would result in a rate less than 0%, we assume a rate of 0% in our 200 basis points decline scenario. Net Interest Income Sensitivity This sensitivity measure estimates the impact on our projected 12-month baseline interest rate-sensitive revenue resulting from movements in interest rates. Interest rate-sensitive revenue consists of net interest income and certain components of other non-interest income significantly impacted by movements in interest rates, including changes in the fair value of free-standing interest rate derivatives. In addition to our existing assets and liabilities, we incorporate expected future business growth assumptions, such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, and plans for projected changes in our funding mix in our baseline forecast. In measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our projected interest rate-sensitive revenue, we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates of +200 basis points, +100 basis points, +50 basis points, -50 basis points, -100 basis points and -200 basis points to spot rates, with the lower rate scenario limited to zero as described above . At the current level of interest rates, our net interest income remains largely unchanged in most scenarios and decreases in the -200 basis points scenario. Economic Value of Equity Our economic value of equity sensitivity measure estimates the impact on the net present value of our assets and liabilities, including derivative hedging activity, resulting from movements in interest rates. Our economic value of equity sensitivity measures are calculated based on our existing assets and liabilities, including derivatives, and do not incorporate business growth assumptions or projected plans for funding mix changes. In measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our economic value of equity, we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates of +200 basis points, +100 basis points, +50 basis points, -50 basis points, -100 basis points and -200 basis points to spot rates, with the lower rate scenario limited to zero as described above . Calculating our economic value of equity and its sensitivity to interest rates requires projecting cash flows for assets, liabilities and derivative instruments and discounting those cash flows at the appropriate discount rates. Key assumptions in our economic value of equity calculation include projecting rate sensitive prepayments for mortgage securities, loans and other assets, term structure modeling of interest rates, discount spreads, and deposit volume and pricing assumptions. Our current economic value of equity sensitivity profile demonstrates that our economic value of equity generally decreases as interest rates increase or decrease from the current levels. 46 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents Table 32 shows the estimated percentage impact on our projected baseline net interest income and economic value of equity calculated under the methodology described above as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . Table 32 : Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis March 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Estimated impact on projected baseline net interest income: +200 basis points 0.0 % (0.8 )% +100 basis points 0.2 (0.2 ) +50 basis points 0.3 0.0 50 basis points (0.6 ) (0.3 ) 100 basis points (1.5 ) (1.0 ) 200 basis points (4.1 ) (3.7 ) Estimated impact on economic value of equity: +200 basis points (6.5 ) (7.1 ) +100 basis points (2.3 ) (2.9 ) +50 basis points (0.8 ) (1.2 ) 50 basis points (0.4 ) 0.2 100 basis points (2.7 ) (0.8 ) 200 basis points (13.5 ) (8.0 ) In addition to these industry standard measures, we will continue to factor into our internal interest rate risk management decisions, the potential impact of alternative interest rate scenarios, such as stressed rate shocks, as well as steepening and flattening yield curve scenarios. Limitations of Market Risk Measures The interest rate risk models that we use in deriving these measures incorporate contractual information, internally-developed assumptions and proprietary modeling methodologies, which project borrower and depositor behavior patterns in certain interest rate environments. Other market inputs, such as interest rates, market prices and interest rate volatility, are also critical components of our interest rate risk measures. We regularly evaluate, update and enhance these assumptions, models and analytical tools as we believe appropriate to reflect our best assessment of the market environment and the expected behavior patterns of our existing assets and liabilities. There are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates. The sensitivity analysis described above contemplates only certain movements in interest rates and is performed at a particular point in time based on the existing balance sheet and, in some cases, expected future business growth and funding mix assumptions. The strategic actions that management may take to manage our balance sheet may differ significantly from our projections, which could cause our actual earnings and economic value of equity sensitivities to differ substantially from the above sensitivity analysis. 47 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents SUPERVISION AND REGULATION On March 6, 2019, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule exempting certain banking institutions, including Capital One, from a potential qualitative objection under the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review ( CCAR ) process, beginning with the 2019 CCAR cycle. The qualitative review assesses the strength of a banking institution internal capital planning process, including the reasonableness of the assumptions, analysis and methodologies used to assess capital adequacy. The final rule states that a banking institution is no longer subject to a CCAR qualitative review if the institution capital plan has been subject to potential qualitative objection for four consecutive years and did not receive a qualitative objection in the last year. We satisfy these criteria. The final rule states that firms exempt from the public CCAR qualitative objection are still subject to the Federal Reserve regular supervisory assessments over the quality of a firm capital planning practices. United Kingdom The U.K. exit ( Brexit ) from the European Union ( EU ) has been extended beyond the originally agreed exit date of March 29, 2019 by agreement between the U.K. and the rest of the EU to October 31, 2019. This new deadline does not preclude the U.K. leaving before that date if a withdrawal agreement has been ratified by the U.K. Parliament at any time before October 31. It still remains unclear what the precise terms of any withdrawal agreement will be, and whether in fact the U.K. will exit by the new deadline. The effects of Brexit on Capital One (Europe) plc ( COEP ) operations are currently unclear. See Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2018 Form 10-K for more discussion of the risks associated with Brexit.

We consider these metrics to be key financial performance measures that management uses in assessing capital adequacy and the level of returns generated. While these non-GAAP measures are widely used by investors, analysts and bank regulatory agencies to assess the capital position of financial services companies, they may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. The following table presents reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the applicable amounts measured in accordance with GAAP.

For loans that are or have been on nonaccrual status, the carrying value is also reduced by any net charge-offs that have been recorded and the amount of interest payments applied as a reduction of principal under the cost recovery method. For credit card loans, the carrying value also includes interest that has been billed to the customer. For loans classified as held for sale, carrying value is the lower of carrying value as described in the sentences above, or fair value. For PCI loans, carrying value represents the present value of all expected cash flows including interest that has not yet been accrued, discounted at the effective interest rate, including any valuation allowance for impaired loans.

Capital One Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company ) offer a broad array of financial products and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients through branches, the internet and other distribution channels. As of March 31, 2019 , our principal subsidiaries included: Capital One Bank (USA), National Association ( COBNA ), which offers credit and debit card products, other lending products and deposit products; and Capital One, National Association ( CONA ), which offers a broad spectrum of banking products and financial services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients. The Company is hereafter collectively referred to as we, us or our. COBNA and CONA are collectively referred to as the Banks. We also offer products outside of the United States of America ( U.S. ) principally through Capital One (Europe) plc ( COEP ), an indirect subsidiary of COBNA organized and located in the United Kingdom ( U.K. ), and through a branch of COBNA in Canada. COEP has authority, among other things, to provide credit card loans. Our branch of COBNA in Canada also has the authority to provide credit card loans. Our principal operations are organized for management reporting purposes into three major business segments, which are defined primarily based on the products and services provided or the type of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. We provide details on our business segments, the integration of recent acquisitions, if any, into our business segments and the allocation methodologies and accounting policies used to derive our business segment results in Note 13 Business Segments and Revenue from Contracts with Customers . Basis of Presentation and Use of Estimates The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ( U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and in the related disclosures. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. While management makes its best judgments, actual amounts or results could differ from these estimates. In the opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments have been included for a fair statement of this interim financial information. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements, and related notes thereto, included in Capital One Financial Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K ( 2018 Form 10-K ). 63 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Newly Adopted Accounting Standards Standard Guidance Adoption Timing and Financial Statements Impacts Premium Amortization on Callable Debt Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2017-08, Receivables Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic 310-20): Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities Issued March 2017 Shortens the amortization period from the contractual life to the earliest call date for certain purchased callable debt securities held at a premium. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2019 using the modified retrospective method of adoption. Our adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Leases ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) Issued February 2016 Requires lessees to recognize right of use assets and lease liabilities on their consolidated balance sheets and disclose key information about all their leasing arrangements, with certain practical expedients. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2019, using the modified retrospective method of adoption without restating prior periods. We elected the practical expedients that permitted us to not reassess the lease classification of existing leases, whether existing contracts contain a lease or the treatment of initial direct costs on existing leases. Upon adoption, we recorded a lease liability of $1.9 billion and right of use asset of $1.6 billion, which is net of other lease-related balances. Accounting Standards Issued but Not Adopted as of March 31, 2019 Standard Guidance Adoption Timing and Financial Statements Impacts Cloud Computing ASU No. 2018-15, Intangibles Goodwill and Other Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract Issued August 2018 Aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license). Effective January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted, using either the retrospective or prospective method of adoption. We plan to adopt the standard on its effective date and are currently evaluating the expected impact of such adoption. Goodwill Impairment Test Simplification ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment Issued January 2017 Eliminates the second step from the current goodwill impairment test. Under the current guidance, the first step compares a reporting unit carrying value to its fair value. If the carrying value exceeds fair value, an entity performs the second step, which assigns the reporting unit fair value to its assets and liabilities, including unrecognized assets and liabilities, in the same manner as required in purchase accounting. Under the new guidance, any impairment of a reporting unit goodwill is determined based on the amount by which the reporting unit carrying value exceeds its fair value, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Effective January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted, using the prospective method of adoption. We plan to adopt the standard on its effective date and do not expect such adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 64 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Standard Guidance Adoption Timing and Financial Statements Impacts Current Expected Credit Loss ( CECL ) ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments Issued June 2016 Requires the use of current expected credit loss model that is based on expected rather than incurred losses to determine our allowance for credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost, certain net investments in leases and certain off-balance sheet arrangements. Replaces current accounting for PCI and impaired loans. Amends the other-than-temporary impairment model for available for sale debt securities to require that credit losses (and subsequent recoveries) be recorded through an allowance approach, rather than through permanent write-downs for credit losses and subsequent accretion of positive changes through interest income over time. Effective January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted no earlier than January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective method of adoption. We plan to adopt the standard on its effective date. We have established a company-wide, cross-functional governance structure for our implementation of this standard. We continue to evaluate industry accounting interpretations, data requirements and necessary changes to our credit loss estimation methods, processes, systems and controls. We have commenced limited parallel testing and expect to perform multiple tests of our full end-to-end allowance process prior to adopting the standard. We continue to assess the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements, related disclosures and regulatory capital. We currently expect our adoption of this guidance will result in an increase to our reserves for credit losses on financial instruments due to the requirement to record expected losses over the remaining contractual lives of our financial instruments; however, the actual impact will depend on the characteristics of our financial instruments, economic conditions, and our economic and loss forecasts at the adoption date. 65 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 2 LEASES Leases In the first quarter of 2019, we adopted ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for the impacts upon adoption. Our primary involvement with leases is in the capacity as a lessee where we lease premises to support our business. A majority of our leases are operating leases of office space, retail bank branches and Caf s. For these leases, we have elected to account for the lease and non-lease components together as a single lease component. Our operating leases expire at various dates through 2071 without taking into consideration available renewal options, and many of them require variable lease payments by us, of property taxes, insurance premiums, common area maintenance and other costs. Certain of these leases also have extension or termination options, and we assess the likelihood of exercising such options. If it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the options, we include the impact in the measurement of our right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Our right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for operating leases are included in other assets and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. As most of our operating leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments. Our operating lease expense is included in occupancy and equipment within non-interest expense in our consolidated statements of income. Total operating lease expense consists of operating lease cost, which is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and variable lease cost, which is recognized based on actual amounts incurred. We also sublease certain premises and sublease income is included in other non-interest income. The following tables present our operating lease portfolio and related lease costs as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2019 . Table 2.1 Operating Lease Portfolio (Dollars in millions) March 31, 2019 Right-of-use assets $ 1,547 Lease liabilities 1,836 Weighted average remaining lease term 9.2 years Weighted average discount rate 3.3 % Table 2.2 Total Operating Lease Expense and Other Information (Dollars in millions) Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 Operating lease cost $ 65 Variable lease cost 11 Total lease cost 76 Sublease income ( 6 ) Net lease cost $ 70 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities $ 82 Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities 15 Right-of-use assets recognized upon adoption of new lease standard 1,601 66 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The following table presents a maturity analysis of our operating leases and a reconciliation of the undiscounted cash flows to our lease liabilities as of March 31, 2019 .

These right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are included in premises and equipment, net and other borrowings on our consolidated balance sheets. We recognized $ 5 million of total finance lease expense for the three months ended March 31, 2019 . 67 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 3 INVESTMENT SECURITIES Our investment securities portfolio consists primarily of the following: U.S. Treasury securities; U.S. government-sponsored enterprise or agency ( Agency ) and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities ( RMBS ); Agency commercial mortgage-backed securities ( CMBS ); and other securities. Agency securities include Government National Mortgage Association ( Ginnie Mae ) guaranteed securities, Federal National Mortgage Association ( Fannie Mae ) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( Freddie Mac ) issued securities. The carrying value of our investments in U.S. Treasury and Agency securities represented 96 % of our total investment securities as of both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . We classify investment securities as either available for sale or held to maturity.

Other-Than-Temporary Impairment We evaluate all securities in an unrealized loss position at least quarterly, and more often as market conditions require, to assess whether the impairment is other-than-temporary. Our OTTI assessment is based on a discounted cash flow analysis which requires careful use of judgments and assumptions. A number of qualitative and quantitative criteria may be considered in our assessment, as applicable, including the size and the nature of the portfolio; historical and projected performance such as prepayment, default and loss severity for the RMBS portfolio; recent credit events specific to the issuer and/or industry to which the issuer belongs; the payment structure of the security; external credit ratings of the issuer and any failure or delay of the issuer to make scheduled interest or principal payments; the value of underlying collateral; our intent and ability to hold the security; and current and projected market and macro-economic conditions. If we intend to sell a security in an unrealized loss position or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, the entire difference between the amortized cost basis of the security and its fair value is recognized in earnings. As of March 31, 2019 , we had sold all securities previously designated with the intent to sell, and did not intend to sell, nor believe that we will be required to sell, any other security in an unrealized loss position prior to the recovery of its amortized cost basis. For those securities that we do not intend to sell nor expect to be required to sell, an analysis is performed to determine if any of the impairment is due to credit-related factors or whether it is due to other factors, such as interest rates. Credit-related impairment is recognized in earnings, with the remaining unrealized non-credit-related impairment recorded in AOCI. We determine the credit component based on the difference between the security amortized cost basis and the present value of its expected cash flows, discounted at the security effective yield. 71 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Realized Gains and Losses on Securities and OTTI Recognized in Earnings The following table presents the gross realized gains or losses and proceeds from the sale of securities available for sale for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 .

Credit card loans consist of domestic and international credit card loans. Consumer banking loans consist of auto and retail banking loans and in prior periods also consisted of home loans. Commercial banking loans primarily consist of commercial and multifamily real estate as well as commercial and industrial loans. We sold all of our consumer home loan portfolio and the related servicing during 2018. The information presented in this section excludes loans held for sale, which are carried at lower of cost or fair value. Credit Quality We closely monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to manage and evaluate our exposure to credit risk. Trends in delinquency rates are an indicator, among other considerations, of credit risk within our loan portfolio. The level of nonperforming loans represents another indicator of the potential for future credit losses. Accordingly, key metrics we track and use in evaluating the credit quality of our loan portfolio include delinquency and nonperforming loan rates, as well as net charge-off rates and our internal risk ratings of commercial loans. The table below presents the composition and an aging analysis of our loans held for investment portfolio as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . The delinquency aging includes all past due loans, both performing and nonperforming.

We therefore generally manage credit risk based on portfolios with common risk characteristics. The risk in our credit card loan portfolio correlates to broad economic trends, such as unemployment rates and home values, as well as consumers financial condition, all of which can have a material effect on credit performance. The primary indicators we assess in monitoring the credit quality and risk of our credit card portfolio are delinquency and charge-off trends, including an analysis of loan migration between delinquency categories over time.

(2) Nonperforming loan rates are calculated based on nonperforming loans for each category divided by period-end total loans held for investment for each respective category. Commercial Banking We evaluate the credit risk of commercial loans using a risk rating system. We assign internal risk ratings to loans based on relevant information about the ability of the borrowers to repay their debt. In determining the risk rating of a particular loan, some of the factors considered are the borrower current financial condition, historical and projected future credit performance, prospects for support from financially responsible guarantors, the estimated realizable value of any collateral and current economic trends. The scale based on our internal risk rating system is as follows: Noncriticized: Loans that have not been designated as criticized, frequently referred to as pass loans. Criticized performing: Loans in which the financial condition of the obligor is stressed, affecting earnings, cash flows or collateral values. The borrower currently has adequate capacity to meet near-term obligations; however, the stress, left unabated, may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects at some future date. Criticized nonperforming: Loans that are not adequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or the collateral pledged, if any. Loans classified as criticized nonperforming have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses, which jeopardize the full repayment of the debt. These loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain a credit loss if the deficiencies are not corrected and are generally placed on nonaccrual status. We use our internal risk rating system for regulatory reporting, determining the frequency of credit exposure reviews, and evaluating and determining the allowance for loan and lease losses for commercial loans. Generally, loans that are designated as criticized performing and criticized nonperforming are reviewed quarterly by management to determine if they are appropriately classified/rated and whether any impairment exists. Noncriticized loans are also generally reviewed, at least annually, to determine the appropriate risk rating. In addition, we evaluate the risk rating during the renewal process of any loan or if a loan becomes past due. 78 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The following table presents the geographic concentration and internal risk ratings of our commercial loan portfolio as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 .

In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we also estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments, such as letters of credit, financial guarantees and binding unfunded loan commitments. The provision for losses on unfunded lending commitments is included in the provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of income and the related reserve for unfunded lending commitments is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our 2018 Form 10-K for further discussion of the methodology and policy for determining our allowance for loan and lease losses for each of our loan portfolio segments, as well as information on our reserve for unfunded lending commitments.

The expected reimbursements from these partners, which are netted against our allowance for loan and lease losses, result in reductions to net charge-offs and provision for credit losses. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our 2018 Form 10-K for further discussion of our credit card partnership agreements. The table below summarizes the changes in the estimated reimbursements from these partners for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 .

Our primary involvement with VIEs has been related to our securitization transactions in which we transferred assets to securitization trusts. We have primarily securitized credit card loans, which have provided a source of funding for us and enabled us to transfer a certain portion of the economic risk of the loans or related debt securities to third parties. The entity that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is referred to as the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the VIE. The majority of the VIEs in which we are involved have been consolidated in our financial statements. Summary of Consolidated and Unconsolidated VIEs The assets of our consolidated VIEs primarily consist of cash, credit card loan receivables and the related allowance for loan and lease losses, which we report on our consolidated balance sheets under restricted cash for securitization investors, loans held in consolidated trusts and allowance for loan and lease losses, respectively. The assets of a particular VIE are the primary source of funds to settle its obligations. Creditors of these VIEs typically do not have recourse to our general credit. Liabilities primarily consist of debt securities issued by the VIEs, which we report under securitized debt obligations on our consolidated balance sheets. For unconsolidated VIEs, we present the carrying amount of assets and liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheets and our maximum exposure to loss. Our maximum exposure to loss is estimated based on the unlikely event that all of the assets in the VIEs become worthless and we are required to meet our maximum remaining funding obligations. The tables below present a summary of VIEs in which we had continuing involvement or held a variable interest, aggregated based on VIEs with similar characteristics as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . We separately present information for consolidated and unconsolidated VIEs.

(2) In certain investment structures, we consolidate a VIE which in turn holds as its primary asset an investment in an unconsolidated VIE. In these instances, we disclose the carrying amount of assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as unconsolidated VIEs to avoid duplicating our exposure, as the unconsolidated VIEs are generally the operating entities generating the exposure. The carrying amount of assets and liabilities included in the unconsolidated VIE columns above related to these investment structures were $ 2.3 billion of assets and $ 845 million of liabilities as of March 31, 2019 and $ 2.3 billion of assets and $ 811 million of liabilities as of December 31, 2018 . Securitization-Related VIEs In a securitization transaction, assets are transferred to a trust, which generally meets the definition of a VIE. Our primary securitization activity is in the form of credit card securitizations, conducted through securitization trusts which we consolidate. Our continuing involvement in these securitization transactions mainly consists of acting as the primary servicer and holding certain retained interests. We transfer multifamily commercial loans that we originate to the government-sponsored enterprises ( GSEs ) and retain the right to service the transferred loans pursuant to the guidelines set forth by the GSEs. Subsequent to such transfers, these loans are commonly securitized into CMBS by the GSEs. We also hold RMBS and CMBS in our investment securities portfolio, which represent an interest in the respective securitization trusts employed in the transactions under which those securities were issued. We do not consolidate the securitization trusts employed in these transactions as we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these securitization trusts. Our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with these VIEs is the carrying value of MSRs and investment securities on our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 7 Goodwill and Intangible Assets for information related to our MSRs associated with these multifamily commercial loan securitizations and Note 3 Investment Securities for more information on the securities held in our investment securities portfolio. We exclude these VIEs from the tables within this note because we do not consider our continuing involvement with these VIEs to be significant as we either invest in securities issued by the VIE and were not involved in the design of the VIE or no transfers have occurred between the VIE and us. In addition, where we have certain lending arrangements in the normal course of business with entities that could be VIEs, we have also excluded these VIEs from the tables presented in this note. See Note 4 Loans for additional information regarding our lending arrangements in the normal course of business. 87 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The table below presents our continuing involvement in certain securitization-related VIEs as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . Table 6.2 : Continuing Involvement in Securitization-Related VIEs (Dollars in millions) Credit Card Mortgages March 31, 2019: Securities held by third-party investors $ 19,273 $ 1,183 Receivables in the trust 31,682 1,209 Cash balance of spread or reserve accounts 0 116 Retained interests Yes Yes Servicing retained Yes Yes (1) December 31, 2018: Securities held by third-party investors $ 18,307 $ 1,276 Receivables in the trust 34,197 1,305 Cash balance of spread or reserve accounts 0 116 Retained interests Yes Yes Servicing retained Yes Yes (1) __________ (1) We retain servicing on a portion of our remaining mortgage loans in mortgage securitizations. Credit Card Securitizations We securitize a portion of our credit card loans which provides a source of funding for us. The credit card securitizations involve the transfer of credit card receivables from our balance sheet to securitization trusts. These trusts then issue debt securities collateralized by the transferred receivables to third-party investors. We hold certain retained interests in our credit card securitizations and continue to service the receivables in these trusts. We consolidate these trusts because we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary as we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts, and the right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the trusts. Mortgage Securitizations We had previously securitized mortgage loans by transferring these loans to securitization trusts that had issued mortgage-backed securities to investors. These mortgage trusts consist of option-adjustable rate mortgage ( option-ARM ) securitizations and securitizations from our discontinued operations which include the mortgage origination operations of our wholesale mortgage banking unit, GreenPoint Mortgage Funding, Inc. ( GreenPoint ) and the manufactured housing operations of GreenPoint Credit, LLC, a subsidiary of GreenPoint (collectively GreenPoint securitizations ). We continue to service a portion of the remaining mortgage loans in the option-ARM securitizations and also retain rights to certain future cash flows arising from these securitizations. We also retain servicing on a portion of the remaining mortgage loans in the GreenPoint securitizations and have the right to receive any funds remaining in the pre-funded letters of credit after the securities are released. We do not consolidate the mortgage securitizations because we do not have the right to receive the benefits nor the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the trusts or we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts. Other VIEs Affordable Housing Entities As part of our community reinvestment initiatives, we invest in private investment funds that make equity investments in multifamily affordable housing properties. We receive affordable housing tax credits for these investments. The activities of these entities are financed with a combination of invested equity capital and debt. We account for certain of our investments in qualified affordable housing projects using the proportional amortization method if certain criteria are met. The proportional amortization method 88 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS amortizes the cost of the investment over the period in which the investor expects to receive tax credits and other tax benefits, and the resulting amortization is recognized as a component of income tax expense attributable to continuing operations. For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 , we recognized amortization of $ 143 million and $ 124 million , respectively, and tax credits of $ 171 million and $ 146 million , respectively, associated with these investments within income tax provision. The carrying value of our equity investments in these qualified affordable housing projects was $ 4.3 billion and $ 4.2 billion as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , respectively. We are periodically required to provide additional financial or other support during the period of the investments. Our liability for these unfunded commitments was $ 1.5 billion as of both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 and is largely expected to be paid from 2019 to 2021 . For those investment funds considered to be VIEs, we are not required to consolidate them if we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of those entities. We record our interests in these unconsolidated VIEs in loans held for investment, other assets and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Our maximum exposure to these entities is limited to our variable interests in the entities which consisted of assets of approximately $ 4.4 billion and $ 4.2 billion as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , respectively. The creditors of the VIEs have no recourse to our general credit and we do not provide additional financial or other support other than during the period that we are contractually required to provide it. The total assets of the unconsolidated VIE investment funds were approximately $ 10.8 billion as of both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , respectively. Entities that Provide Capital to Low-Income and Rural Communities We hold variable interests in entities ( Investor Entities ) that invest in community development entities ( CDEs ) that provide debt financing to businesses and non-profit entities in low-income and rural communities. Variable interests in the CDEs held by the consolidated Investor Entities are also our variable interests. The activities of the Investor Entities are financed with a combination of invested equity capital and debt. The activities of the CDEs are financed solely with invested equity capital. We receive federal and state tax credits for these investments. We consolidate the VIEs in which we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE economic performance and where we have the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to the VIE. We have also consolidated other investments and CDEs that are not considered to be VIEs, but where we hold a controlling financial interest. The assets of the VIEs that we consolidated, which totaled approximately $ 1.7 billion as of both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , respectively, are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets in cash, loans held for investment, and other assets. The liabilities are reflected in other liabilities. The creditors of the VIEs have no recourse to our general credit. We have not provided additional financial or other support other than during the period that we are contractually required to provide it. Other Other VIEs include variable interests that we hold in companies that promote renewable energy sources and other equity method investments. We were not required to consolidate these entities because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact their economic performance. Our maximum exposure to these entities is limited to the investment on our consolidated balance sheets of $ 530 million and $ 353 million as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , respectively. The creditors of the other VIEs have no recourse to our general credit. We have not provided additional financial or other support other than during the period that we are contractually required to provide it. 89 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 7 GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS The table below presents our goodwill, intangible assets and MSRs as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 .

We also use a variety of other funding sources including short-term borrowings, senior and subordinated notes, securitized debt obligations and other borrowings. In addition, we utilize FHLB advances, which are secured by certain portions of our loan and investment securities portfolios. Securitized debt obligations are presented separately on our consolidated balance sheets, as they represent obligations of consolidated securitization trusts, while federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, senior and subordinated notes and other borrowings, including FHLB advances, are included in other debt on our consolidated balance sheets. Our total short-term borrowings generally consist of federal funds purchased, securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, and short-term FHLB advances. Our long-term debt consists of borrowings with an original contractual maturity of greater than one year. The following tables summarize the components of our deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . The carrying value presented below for these borrowings includes unamortized debt premiums and discounts, net of debt issuance costs and fair value hedge accounting adjustments.

Our primary market risks stem from the impact on our earnings and economic value of equity due to changes in interest rates and, to a lesser extent, changes in foreign exchange rates. We manage our interest rate sensitivity by employing several techniques, which include changing the duration and re-pricing characteristics of various assets and liabilities by using interest rate derivatives. We also use foreign currency derivatives to limit our earnings and capital exposures to foreign exchange risk by hedging exposures denominated in foreign currencies. In addition to interest rate and foreign currency derivatives, we may also use a variety of other derivative instruments, including caps, floors, options, futures and forward contracts, to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risks. We designate these risk management derivatives as either qualifying accounting hedges or free-standing derivatives. Qualifying accounting hedges are further designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges, and free-standing derivatives are economic hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting. We also offer various interest rate, commodity and foreign currency derivatives as accommodation to our customers within our Commercial Banking business. We enter into these derivatives with our customers primarily to help them manage interest rate risks, hedge their energy and other commodities exposures, and manage foreign currency fluctuations. We then enter into offsetting derivative contracts with counterparties to economically hedge the majority of our subsequent exposures. See below for additional information on our use of derivatives and how we account for them: Fair Value Hedges: We designate derivatives as fair value hedges when they are used to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities, which fluctuate in value as a result of movements in interest rates. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are presented in the same line item on our consolidated statements of income as the earnings effect of the hedged items. Our fair value hedges consist of interest rate swaps that are intended to modify our exposure to interest rate risk on various fixed-rate financial assets and liabilities. Cash Flow Hedges: We designate derivatives as cash flow hedges when they are used to manage our exposure to variability in cash flows related to forecasted transactions. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of AOCI. Those amounts are reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the forecasted transactions impact earnings and presented in the same line item on our consolidated statements of income as the earnings effect of the hedged items. Our cash flow hedges use interest rate swaps and floors that are intended to hedge the variability in interest receipts or interest payments on some of our variable-rate financial assets or liabilities. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our exposure to variability in cash flows related to intercompany borrowings denominated in a foreign currency. Net Investment Hedges: We use net investment hedges to manage the foreign currency exposure related to our net investments in foreign operations that have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in the fair value of net investment hedges are recorded in the translation adjustment component of AOCI, offsetting the translation gain or loss from those foreign operations. We execute net investment hedges using foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the translation exposure of the net investment in our foreign operations under the forward method. Free-Standing Derivatives: Our free-standing derivatives primarily consist of our customer accommodation derivatives and other economic hedges. The customer accommodation derivatives and the related offsetting contracts are mainly interest rate, commodity and foreign currency contracts. The other free-standing derivatives are primarily used to economically hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of our commercial mortgage loan origination and purchase commitments as well as other interests held. Changes in the fair value of free-standing derivatives are recorded in earnings as a component of other non-interest income. 93 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Derivatives Counterparty Credit Risk Counterparty Types Derivative instruments contain an element of credit risk that arises from the potential failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of the contract. We execute our derivative contracts primarily in over-the-counter ( OTC ) markets. We also execute minimal amounts of interest rate and commodity futures in the exchange-traded derivative markets. Our OTC derivatives consist of both centrally cleared and uncleared bilateral contracts. In our centrally cleared contracts, our counterparties are central counterparty clearinghouses ( CCPs ), such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ( CME ) and the LCH Group ( LCH ). In our uncleared bilateral contracts, we enter into agreements directly with our derivative counterparties. Counterparty Credit Risk Management We generally manage our counterparty credit risk associated with derivative instruments by entering into legally enforceable master netting arrangements, where possible, and exchanging margin and collateral with our counterparties, typically in the form of cash or high-quality liquid securities. The amount of collateral exchanged is dependent upon the fair value of the derivative instruments as well as the fair value of the pledged collateral. When valuing collateral, an estimate of the variation in price and liquidity over time is subtracted in the form of a haircut to discount the value of the collateral pledged. Our exposure to derivative counterparty credit risk, at any point in time, is equal to the amount reported as a derivative asset on our balance sheet. The fair value of derivatives is adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and any associated cash collateral received or pledged. See Table 9.3 for our net exposure associated with derivatives. The terms under which we collateralize our exposures differ between cleared exposures and uncleared bilateral exposures. CCPs : We clear eligible OTC derivatives with CCPs as part of our regulatory requirements. Futures commission merchants ( FCMs ) serve as the intermediary between CCPs and us. CCPs require that we post initial and variation margin through our FCMs to mitigate the risk of non-payment or default. Initial margin is required upfront by CCPs as collateral against potential losses on our cleared derivative contracts. Variation margin is exchanged on a daily basis to account for mark-to-market changes in the derivative contracts. For CME and LCH-cleared OTC derivatives, we characterize variation margin cash payments as settlements. Our FCM agreements governing these derivative transactions include provisions that may require us to post additional collateral under certain circumstances. Bilateral Counterparties : We generally enter into legally enforceable master netting agreements and collateral agreements, where possible, with bilateral derivative counterparties to mitigate the risk of default. We review our collateral positions on a daily basis and exchange collateral with our counterparties in accordance with these agreements. These bilateral agreements typically provide the right to offset exposure with the same counterparty and require the party in a net liability position to post collateral. Agreements with certain bilateral counterparties require both parties to maintain collateral in the event the fair values of derivative instruments exceed established exposure thresholds. Certain of these bilateral agreements include provisions requiring that our debt maintain a credit rating of investment grade or above by each of the major credit rating agencies. In the event of a downgrade of our debt credit rating below investment grade, some of our counterparties would have the right to terminate the derivative contract and close out the existing positions. Credit Risk Valuation Adjustments We record counterparty credit valuation adjustments ( CVAs ) on our derivative assets to properly reflect the credit quality of the counterparty. We consider collateral and legally enforceable master netting agreements that mitigate our credit exposure to each counterparty in determining CVA, which may be adjusted in future periods due to changes in the fair values of the derivative contracts, collateral and creditworthiness of the counterparty. We also record debit valuation adjustments ( DVAs ) to adjust the fair values of our derivative liabilities to reflect the impact of our own credit quality. We calculate this adjustment by comparing the spreads on our credit default swaps to the discount benchmark curve. 94 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Balance Sheet Presentation The following table summarizes the notional and fair values of our derivative instruments as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , which are segregated by derivatives that are designated as accounting hedges and those that are not, and are further segregated by type of contract within those two categories. The total derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and any associated cash collateral received or pledged.

(2) Carrying value represents amortized cost. Balance Sheet Offsetting of Financial Assets and Liabilities Derivative contracts and repurchase agreements that we execute bilaterally in the OTC market are generally governed by enforceable master netting arrangements where we generally have the right to offset exposure with the same counterparty. Either counterparty can generally request to net settle all contracts through a single payment upon default on, or termination of, any one contract. We elect to offset the derivative assets and liabilities under netting arrangements for balance sheet presentation where a right of setoff exists. For derivative contracts entered into under master netting arrangements for which we have not been able to confirm the enforceability of the setoff rights, or those not subject to master netting arrangements, we do not offset our derivative positions for balance sheet presentation. 96 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The following table presents as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 the gross and net fair values of our derivative assets and liabilities and repurchase agreements, as well as the related offsetting amounts permitted under U.S. GAAP.

(3) We recognized a loss of $ 172 million and a gain of $ 75 million on foreign exchange contracts reclassified from AOCI for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These amounts were entirely offset by the foreign currency transaction gains (losses) on our foreign currency denominated inter-company borrowings included non-interest income. In the next 12 months, we expect to reclassify to earnings net after-tax losses of $ 113 million recorded in AOCI as of March 31, 2019 . These amounts will offset the cash flows associated with the hedged forecasted transactions. The maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions were hedged was approximately seven years as of March 31, 2019 . The amount we expect to reclassify into earnings may change as a result of changes in market conditions and ongoing actions taken as part of our overall risk management strategy.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income Accumulated other comprehensive income primarily consists of accumulated net unrealized gains or losses associated with available for sale securities, the changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, unrealized gains and losses on securities held to maturity on the transfer date from the available for sale category and foreign currency translation adjustments. Unrealized gains and losses for securities held to maturity are amortized over the remaining life of the security with no expected impact on future net income as amortization of these gains or losses will be offset by the amortization of the premium or discount created from the transfer of securities from available to sale to held to maturity.

The fair value accounting guidance provides a three-level fair value hierarchy for classifying financial instruments. This hierarchy is based on the markets in which the assets or liabilities trade and whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable. The fair value measurement of a financial asset or liability is assigned a level based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: Level 1: Valuation is based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Valuation is based on observable market-based inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3: Valuation is generated from techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. Valuation techniques include pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques. The accounting guidance for fair value measurements requires that we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in determining fair value. The accounting guidance provides for the irrevocable option to elect, on a contract-by-contract basis, to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value at inception of the contract and record any subsequent changes in fair value in earnings. We have not made any material fair value option elections as of or for the periods disclosed herein. The determination and classification of financial instruments in the fair value hierarchy is performed at the end of each reporting period. We consider all available information, including observable market data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs. For additional information on the valuation techniques used in estimating the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities on a recurring basis, see Note 17 Fair Value Measurement in our 2018 Form 10-K. Fair Value Governance and Control We have a governance framework and a number of key controls that are intended to ensure that our fair value measurements are appropriate and reliable. Our governance framework provides for independent oversight and segregation of duties. Our control processes include review and approval of new transaction types, price verification, and review of valuation judgments, methods, models, process controls and results. Groups independent of our trading and investing functions participate in the review and validation process. Tasks performed by these groups include periodic verification of fair value measurements to determine if assigned fair values are reasonable, including comparing prices from vendor pricing services to other available market information. Our Fair Value Committee ( FVC ), which includes representation from business areas, Risk Management and Finance, provides guidance and oversight to ensure an appropriate valuation control environment. The FVC regularly reviews and approves our fair valuations to ensure that our valuation practices are consistent with industry standards and adhere to regulatory and accounting guidance. We have a model policy, established by an independent Model Risk Office, which governs the validation of models and related supporting documentation to ensure the appropriate use of models for pricing and fair value measurements. The Model Risk Office validates all models and provides ongoing monitoring of their performance. The fair value governance process is set up in a manner that allows the Chairperson of the FVC to escalate valuation disputes that cannot be resolved by the FVC to a more senior committee called the Valuations Advisory Committee ( VAC ) for resolution. The VAC is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and includes other members of senior management. The VAC convenes to review escalated valuation disputes. 105 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The following table displays our assets and liabilities measured on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value on a recurring basis as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 .

Certain of these unobservable inputs will, in isolation, have a directionally consistent impact on the fair value of the instrument for a given change in that input. Alternatively, the fair value of the instrument may move in an opposite direction for a given change in another input. In general, an increase in the discount rate, default rates, loss severity and credit spreads, in isolation, would result in a decrease in the fair value measurement. In addition, an increase in default rates would generally be accompanied by a decrease in recovery rates, slower prepayment rates and an increase in liquidity spreads. Techniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value Measurements The following table presents the significant unobservable inputs used to determine the fair values of our Level 3 financial instruments on a recurring basis. We utilize multiple vendor pricing services to obtain fair value for our securities. Several of our vendor pricing services are only able to provide unobservable input information for a limited number of securities due to software licensing restrictions. Other vendor pricing services are able to provide unobservable input information for all securities for which they provide a valuation. As a result, the unobservable input information for the securities available for sale presented below represents a composite summary of all information we are able to obtain. The unobservable input information for all other Level 3 financial instruments is based on the assumptions used in our internal valuation models.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis We are required to measure and recognize certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on the consolidated balance sheets. These assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (for example, from the application of lower of cost or fair value accounting or when we evaluate for impairment). The following table presents the carrying value of the assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and still held as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , and for which a nonrecurring fair value measurement was recorded during three and twelve months then ended.

As of December 31, 2018 , other assets included equity investments accounted for under the measurement alternative of $ 24 million , foreclosed property and repossessed assets of $ 57 million and long-lived assets held for sale of $ 19 million . In the above table, loans held for investment are generally valued based in part on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral and the non-recoverable rate, which is considered to be a significant unobservable input. The non-recoverable rate ranged from 0 % to 60 % , with a weighted average of 7 % , and from 0 % to 84 % , with a weighted average of 33 % , as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , respectively. The weighted average non-recoverable rate is calculated based on the estimated market value of the underlying collateral. The significant unobservable inputs and related quantitative information related to fair value of the other assets are not meaningful to disclose as they vary significantly across properties and collateral. 109 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The following table presents total nonrecurring fair value measurements for the period, included in earnings, attributable to the change in fair value relating to assets that are still held at March 31, 2019 and 2018 .

The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio, asset/liability management by our centralized Corporate Treasury group and residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate that is not assessed to our primary business segments, are included in the Other category. Basis of Presentation We report the results of each of our business segments on a continuing operations basis. The results of our individual businesses reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources. Business Segment Reporting Methodology The results of our business segments are intended to present each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. Our internal management and reporting process used to derive our segment results employs various allocation methodologies, including funds transfer pricing, to assign certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses directly or indirectly attributable to each business segment. Our funds transfer pricing process provides a funds credit for sources of funds, such as deposits generated by our Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking businesses, and a funds charge for the use of funds by each segment. Due to the integrated nature of our business segments, estimates and judgments have been made in allocating certain revenue and expense items. Transactions between segments are based on specific criteria or approximate third-party rates. We regularly assess the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, which may result in the implementation of refinements or changes in future periods. We provide additional information on the allocation methodologies used to derive our business segment results in Note 18 Business Segments and Revenue from Contracts with Customers in our 2018 Form 10-K. Segment Results and Reconciliation We may periodically change our business segments or reclassify business segment results based on modifications to our management reporting methodologies or changes in organizational alignment. In the first quarter of 2019, we made a change in how revenue is measured in our Commercial Banking business by revising the allocation of tax benefits on certain tax-advantaged investments. As such, prior period results have been recast to conform with the current period presentation. The result of this measurement change reduced the previously reported total net revenue in our Commercial Banking business by $30 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, with an offsetting increase in the Other category. This change in measurement of our Commercial Banking revenue did not have any impact to the consolidated financial statements. 112 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The following tables present our business segment results for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 , selected balance sheet data as of March 31, 2019 and 2018 , and a reconciliation of our total business segment results to our reported consolidated income from continuing operations, loans held for investment and deposits.

Accordingly, we present our Commercial Banking revenue and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated using the federal statutory tax rate of 21% and state taxes where applicable, with offsetting reductions to the Other category. (2) In the first quarter of 2019, we made a change in how revenue is measured in our Commercial Banking business by revising the allocation of tax benefits on certain tax-advantaged investments.

Revenue from Contracts with Customers The majority of our revenue from contracts with customers consists of interchange fees in our Credit Card business, service charges and other customer-related fees, and other contract revenue in our Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking businesses. Interchange fees are primarily from our Credit Card business and are recognized upon settlement with the interchange networks, net of rewards earned by customers. Service charges and other customer-related fees within our Consumer Banking business are primarily related to fees earned on consumer deposit accounts for account maintenance and various transaction-based services such as overdrafts and ATM usage. Service charges and other customer-related fees within our Commercial Banking business are mostly related to fees earned on treasury management and capital markets services. Other contract revenue consists primarily of 113 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS revenue earned on certain marketing and promotional events from our auto dealers within our Consumer Banking business. Revenue from contracts with customers is included in non-interest income in our consolidated statements of income.

These commitments, other than credit card lines, are legally binding conditional agreements that have fixed expirations or termination dates and specified interest rates and purposes. The contractual amount of these commitments represents the maximum possible credit risk to us should the counterparty draw upon the commitment. We generally manage the potential risk of unfunded lending commitments by limiting the total amount of arrangements, monitoring the size and maturity structure of these portfolios, and applying the same credit standards for all of our credit activities. For unused credit card lines, we have not experienced and do not anticipate that all of our customers will access their entire available line at any given point in time. Commitments to extend credit other than credit card lines generally require customers to maintain certain credit standards. Collateral requirements and loan-to-value ( LTV ) ratios are the same as those for funded transactions and are established based on management credit assessment of the customer. These commitments may expire without being drawn upon; therefore, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future funding requirements. We also issue letters of credit, such as financial standby, performance standby and commercial letters of credit, to meet the financing needs of our customers. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party in a borrowing arrangement. Commercial letters of credit are short-term commitments issued primarily to facilitate trade finance activities for customers and are generally collateralized by the goods being shipped to the client. These collateral requirements are similar to those for funded transactions and are established based on management credit assessment of the customer. Management conducts regular reviews of all outstanding letters of credit and the results of these reviews are considered in assessing the adequacy of reserves for unfunded lending commitments. The following table presents the contractual amount and carrying value of our unfunded lending commitments as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . The carrying value represents our reserve and deferred revenue on legally binding commitments. Table 14.1 : Unfunded Lending Commitments: Contractual Amount and Carrying Value Contractual Amount Carrying Value (Dollars in millions) March 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 March 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Credit card lines $ 352,826 $ 346,186 N/A N/A Other loan commitments (1) 35,446 34,449 $ 102 $ 95 Standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit (2) 1,767 1,792 31 29 Total unfunded lending commitments $ 390,039 $ 382,427 $ 133 $ 124 __________ (1) Includes $ 1.2 billion and $ 1.3 billion of advised lines of credit as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , respectively. (2) These financial guarantees have expiration dates ranging from 2019 to 2025 as of March 31, 2019 . Loss Sharing Agreements and Other Obligations Within our Commercial Banking business, we originate multifamily commercial real estate loans with the intent to sell them to the GSEs. We enter into loss sharing agreements with the GSEs upon the sale of the loans. At inception, we record a liability representing the fair value of our obligation which is subsequently amortized as we are released from risk of payment under the loss sharing agreement. If payment under the loss sharing agreement becomes probable and estimable, an additional liability may be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets and a non-interest expense may be recognized in the consolidated statements of income. The liability recognized on our consolidated balance sheets for our loss sharing agreements was $ 62 million and $ 59 million as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , respectively. 115 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS U.K. Payment Protection Insurance In the U.K., we previously sold payment protection insurance ( PPI ). In response to an elevated level of customer complaints across the industry, heightened media coverage and pressure from consumer advocacy groups, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority ( FCA ), formerly the Financial Services Authority, investigated and raised concerns about the way the industry has handled complaints related to the sale of these insurance policies. For the past several years, the U.K. Financial Ombudsman Service ( FOS ) has been adjudicating customer complaints relating to PPI, escalated to it by consumers who disagree with the rejection of their complaint by firms, leading to customer remediation payments by us and others within the industry. On March 2, 2017, the FCA issued a statement that sets out final rules and guidance on the PPI complaints deadline, which has been set as August 29, 2019. The statement also provides clarity on how to handle PPI complaints under s.140A of the Consumer Credit Act, including guidance on how redress for such complaints should be calculated. The final rules and guidance came into force on August 29, 2017. In determining our best estimate of incurred losses for future remediation payments, management considers numerous factors, including (i) the number of customer complaints we expect in the future; (ii) our expectation of upholding those complaints; (iii) the expected number of complaints customers escalate to the FOS; (iv) our expectation of the FOS upholding such escalated complaints; (v) the number of complaints that fall under s.140A of the Consumer Credit Act; (vi) the number of litigation claims being pursued under s.140A of the Consumer Credit Act; and (vii) the estimated remediation payout to customers. We monitor these factors each quarter and adjust our reserves to reflect the latest data. Management best estimate of U.K. PPI reserve totaled $ 105 million and $ 133 million as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , respectively. For the three months ended March 31, 2019 , no additions were made to our reserve. Other movements to the reserve were a combination of utilization of the reserve through customer refund payments and foreign exchange movements. Our best estimate of reasonably possible future losses beyond our reserve as of March 31, 2019 is approximately $ 100 million . Litigation In accordance with the current accounting standards for loss contingencies, we establish reserves for litigation related matters that arise from the ordinary course of our business activities when it is probable that a loss associated with a claim or proceeding has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. None of the amounts we currently have recorded individually or in the aggregate are considered to be material to our financial condition. Litigation claims and proceedings of all types are subject to many uncertain factors that generally cannot be predicted with assurance. Below we provide a description of potentially material legal proceedings and claims. For some of the matters disclosed below, we are able to estimate reasonably possible losses above existing reserves, and for other disclosed matters, such an estimate is not possible at this time. For those matters below where an estimate is possible, management currently estimates the reasonably possible future losses beyond our reserves as of March 31, 2019 are approximately $ 1.1 billion . Our reserve and reasonably possible loss estimates involve considerable judgment and reflect that there is still significant uncertainty regarding numerous factors that may impact the ultimate loss levels. Notwithstanding our attempt to estimate a reasonably possible range of loss beyond our current accrual levels for some litigation matters based on current information, it is possible that actual future losses will exceed both the current accrual level and the range of reasonably possible losses disclosed here. Given the inherent uncertainties involved in these matters, especially those involving governmental agencies, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters, there is significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability we may incur from these litigation matters and an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period. Interchange In 2005, a putative class of retail merchants filed antitrust lawsuits against MasterCard and Visa and several issuing banks, including Capital One, seeking both injunctive relief and monetary damages for an alleged conspiracy by defendants to fix the level of interchange fees. Other merchants have asserted similar claims in separate lawsuits, and while these separate cases did not name any issuing banks, Visa, MasterCard and issuers, including Capital One, have entered settlement and judgment sharing agreements allocating the liabilities of any judgment or settlement arising from all interchange-related cases. 116 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The lawsuits were consolidated before the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York for certain purposes and were settled in 2012. The class settlement, however, was invalidated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in June 2016, and the suit was separated into separate class actions seeking injunctive and monetary relief, respectively. In addition, numerous merchant groups opted out of the 2012 settlement and have pursued their own claims. The claims by the injunctive relief class have not been resolved, but the parties reached a new settlement agreement with the monetary damages class in August 2018, whereby the class would receive up to approximately $ 6.2 billion collectively from the defendants in exchange for a release of their claims, depending on the percentage of class plaintiffs who opt out. The trial court preliminarily approved the settlement in January 2019. Visa and MasterCard have also settled several of the opt-out cases, which required non-material payments from issuing banks, including Capital One. Visa created a litigation escrow account following its initial public offering of stock in 2008 that funds settlements for its member banks, and any settlements related to MasterCard-allocated losses have either already been paid or are reflected in Capital One reserves. Mortgage Representation and Warranty We face residual exposure related to subsidiaries that originated residential mortgage loans and sold these loans to various purchasers, including purchasers who created securitization trusts. In connection with their sales of mortgage loans, these subsidiaries entered into agreements containing varying representations and warranties about, among other things, the ownership of the loan, the validity of the lien securing the loan, the loan compliance with any applicable criteria established by the purchaser, including underwriting guidelines and the existence of mortgage insurance, and the loan compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws. Each of these subsidiaries may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify certain purchasers and others against losses they incur in the event of certain breaches of these representations and warranties. The substantial majority of our representation and warranty exposure has been resolved through litigation, and our remaining representation and warranty exposure is almost entirely litigation-related. Accordingly, we establish litigation reserves for representation and warranty losses that we consider to be both probable and reasonably estimable. The reserve process relies heavily on estimates, which are inherently uncertain, and requires the application of judgment. Our reserves and estimates of reasonably possible losses could be impacted by claims which may be brought by securitization trustees and sponsors, bond-insurers, investors, and GSEs, as well as claims brought by governmental agencies. Anti-Money Laundering Capital One is subject to an open consent order with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) dated July 10, 2015 relating to our anti-money laundering ( AML ) program. In October 2018, Capital One paid a civil monetary penalty of $ 100 million to resolve the monetary component of the AML consent order. Capital One continues to be investigated by the New York District Attorney Office, the Department of Justice and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network ( FinCEN ) of the U.S. Department of Treasury primarily with respect to certain former check casher clients of the Commercial Banking business and Capital One AML program. Capital One is cooperating with all agencies involved in the investigation. We are in discussions with FinCEN to explore a potential regulatory resolution of its investigation, which could include a monetary penalty. Other Pending and Threatened Litigation In addition, we are commonly subject to various pending and threatened legal actions relating to the conduct of our normal business activities. In the opinion of management, the ultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising out of all such other pending or threatened legal actions, is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial position or our results of operations. 117 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk For a discussion of the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, see MD&A Market Risk Profile . Item 4. Controls and Procedures Overview We are required under applicable laws and regulations to maintain controls and procedures, which include disclosure controls and procedures as well as internal control over financial reporting, as further described below. (a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures refer to controls and other procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our financial reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding our required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and we must apply judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ), our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of March 31, 2019 , the end of the period covered by this Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2019 , at a reasonable level of assurance, in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting information required to be disclosed within the time periods specified by the SEC rules and forms. (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We regularly review our disclosure controls and procedures and make changes intended to ensure the quality of our financial reporting. There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred in the first quarter of 2019 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company internal control over financial reporting. 118 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.
