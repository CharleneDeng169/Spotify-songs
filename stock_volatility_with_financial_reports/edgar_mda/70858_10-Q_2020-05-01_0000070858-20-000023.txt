Bank of America 2 Executive Summary Business Overview The Corporation is a Delaware corporation, a bank holding company (BHC) and a financial holding company. When used in this report, the Corporation, we, us and our may refer to Bank of America Corporation individually, Bank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries, or certain of Bank of America Corporation subsidiaries or affiliates. Our principal executive offices are located in Charlotte, North Carolina. Through our banking and various nonbank subsidiaries throughout the U.S. and in international markets, we provide a diversified range of banking and nonbank financial services and products through four business segments: Consumer Banking , Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM) , Global Banking and Global Markets , with the remaining operations recorded in All Other . We operate our banking activities primarily under the Bank of America, National Association (Bank of America, N.A. or BANA) charter. At March 31, 2020 , the Corporation had $2.6 trillion in assets and a headcount of approximately 209,000 employees. As of March 31, 2020 , we served clients through operations across the U.S., its territories and approximately 35 countries. Our retail banking footprint covers approximately 90 percent of the U.S. population, and we serve approximately 66 million consumer and small business clients with approximately 4,300 retail financial centers, approximately 16,900 ATMs, and leading digital banking platforms (www.bankofamerica.com) with more than 39 million active users, including approximately 30 million active mobile users. We offer industry-leading support to approximately three million small business owners. Our wealth management businesses, with client balances of $2.7 trillion , provide tailored solutions to meet client needs through a full set of investment management, brokerage, banking, trust and retirement products. We are a global leader in corporate and investment banking and trading across a broad range of asset classes serving corporations, governments, institutions and individuals around the world. Recent Developments Capital Management During the first quarter of 2020, we repurchased $6.4 billion of common stock pursuant to the Board of Directors (the Board) repurchase authorization under our 2019 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) plan, including repurchases to offset equity-based compensation awards. As announced on March 15, 2020, due to the impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the global economy, we temporarily suspended common stock repurchases from the date of the announcement through the end of the second quarter of 2020. We made this decision to enable us to provide maximum support to our customers and the broader economy through lending and other services. The suspension does not include repurchases to offset shares issued under equity compensation plans. As a well-capitalized financial institution, we may reinstate our repurchase program at such time as our Board deems advisable, taking into account economic conditions and other considerations. For more information on our capital resources, see Capital Management on page 18 . COVID-19 Pandemic 2020 In the first quarter of 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures attempting to contain the spread and impact of COVID-19, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and limitations on business activity, including closures. These measures are, among other things, severely restricting global economic activity, which is disrupting global supply chains, lowering asset valuations, significantly increasing unemployment and underemployment levels, decreasing liquidity in markets for certain securities and causing significant volatility and disruptions in the financial, energy and commodity markets. These measures have also negatively impacted, and could continue to negatively impact businesses, market participants, our counterparties and clients, and the U.S. and/or global economy for a prolonged period of time. To address the economic impact in the U.S., in March and April 2020, the President signed into law four economic stimulus packages to provide relief to businesses and individuals, including the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act). Among other measures, the CARES Act created funding for the Small Business Administration (SBA) Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which provides loans to small businesses to keep their employees on payroll and make other eligible payments. The original funding for the PPP was fully allocated by mid-April 2020, with additional funding made available on April 24, 2020 under the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act. On April 9, 2020, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) took additional steps to bolster the economy by providing additional funding sources for small and mid-sized businesses as well as for state and local governments as they work through cash flow stresses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the Federal Reserve has taken other steps to provide fiscal and monetary stimuli, including reducing the federal funds rate and the interest rate on the Federal Reserve discount window, and implementing programs to promote liquidity in certain securities markets. The Federal Reserve, along with other U.S. banking regulators, has also issued interagency guidance to financial institutions that are working with borrowers affected by COVID-19. In response to the pandemic, we have implemented protocols and processes to help protect our employees, community partners and clients. These measures include: Operating our businesses from remote locations, leveraging our business continuity plans and capabilities that include having the majority of employees work from home, and other employees operating using pre-planned contingency strategies for critical site-based operations. These capabilities have allowed us to continue to service our clients. We will continue to manage the increased operational risk related to the execution of our business continuity plans in accordance with our Risk Framework and Operational Risk Management Program. Offering assistance to our commercial, consumer and small business clients affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which includes payment deferrals, refunds of certain fees, pausing foreclosure sales, evictions and repossessions, participation in the CARES Act and Federal Reserve lending programs for businesses, including the SBA PPP , and continuing to provide access to the important financial services on which our clients rely. For more information, see Credit Risk Management on page 25 and Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Temporarily suspending common stock repurchases, except those offsetting shares issued under equity compensation plans, to maximize capital and liquidity resources. For more 3 Bank of America information, see Capital Management on page 18 , and Liquidity Risk on page 23 . Pledging $100 million to local communities to purchase medical supplies, food and other priorities. In connection with reviewing our financial condition in light of the pandemic, we evaluated our assets, including goodwill and other intangibles and equity investments, for potential impairment, and reviewed fair values of financial instruments that are carried at fair value. Based upon our review as of March 31, 2020 , no impairments have been recorded and there have been no significant changes in fair value hierarchy classifications. We have also elected to delay for two years the phase-in of the capital impact from our adoption of the new accounting standard on credit losses. For more information, see Capital Management on page 18 . The Corporation has implemented various consumer and commercial loan modification programs to provide its borrowers relief from the economic impacts of COVID-19. Based on guidance in the CARES Act that the Corporation adopted, COVID-19 related modifications to consumer and commercial loans that were current as of December 31, 2019 are exempt from troubled debt restructuring (TDR) classification under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). In addition, the bank regulatory agencies issued interagency guidance stating that COVID-19 related short-term modifications (i.e., six months or less) granted to consumer or commercial loans that were current as of the loan modification program implementation date are not TDRs. For more information, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 5 Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements . The table below provides a summary of the percentage of our loans and loan balances that we have modified in response to COVID-19 under payment deferral or forbearance programs, none of which are classified as TDRs. Table 1 Client Loan Modifications April 27, 2020 % of Accounts with Completed Modifications % of Balances with Completed Modifications Program Details Consumer and Small Business Credit Card 4 % 8 % Deferral of up to 90 days for Consumer and Small Business; interest continues to accrue and is added to principal balance each month Small Business loans and lines of credit 19 41 Deferral of 90 days; for loans, interest continues to accrue and deferred payment is added to end of loan; for lines, interest continues to accrue and is added to principal balance when deferral ends Mortgage and home equity lines of credit (1) 5 7 Deferral of 90 days; interest continues to accrue and deferred payment is added to end of loan Consumer vehicle lending (2) 5 6 Deferral of 60 days for Consumer; deferral of 90 days for Small Business; interest continues to accrue and deferred payment is added to end of loan Commercial loans (3) 3 1 Primarily deferral of up to 90 days; interest continues to accrue with various repayment options; may include short-term covenant waivers Total 4 % 4 % (1) Mortgage and home equity lines of credit includes loans that are held for investment (owned by Bank of America). (2) Vehicle lending includes both consumer and small business. (3) Statistics represent clients who have been given temporary deferment of principal and/or interest for a defined period of time. Given the unprecedented uncertainty and rapidly evolving economic effects and social impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the future direct and indirect impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition are highly uncertain. Should current economic conditions persist or continue to deteriorate, we expect that this macroeconomic environment will have a continued adverse effect on our business and results of operations, which could include, but not be limited to: decreased demand for our products and services, protracted periods of lower interest rates, lower asset management fees, lower sales and trading revenue due to decreased market liquidity resulting from heightened volatility, increased noninterest expenses, including operational losses, and increased credit losses due to deterioration in the financial condition of our consumer and commercial borrowers, including declining asset and collateral values, which may continue to increase our provision for credit losses and net charge-offs. Our provision for credit losses and net charge-offs could also be impacted by continued volatility in the energy and commodity markets. For more information on how the risks related to COVID-19 may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, see Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors on page 96 . LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rates As previously disclosed, to facilitate an orderly transition from Interbank Offered Rates (IBORs) and other benchmark rates to alternative reference rates (ARRs), the Corporation has established an enterprise-wide program to identify, assess and monitor risks associated with the expected discontinuation or unavailability of benchmarks, including the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR). As part of this program, the Corporation continues to identify, assess and monitor risks associated with the expected discontinuation or unavailability of LIBOR and other benchmarks, and evaluate and address documentation and contractual mechanics of outstanding IBOR-based products and contracts that mature after 2021 and new and potential future ARR-based products and contracts to achieve operational readiness. This program, which is led by the Corporation Chief Operating Officer, includes active involvement of senior management and regular reports to the Enterprise Risk Committee. The program is structured to address the Corporation industry and regulatory engagement, client and financial contract changes, internal and external communications, technology and operations modifications, introduction of new products, migration of existing clients, and program strategy and governance. As the markets for ARRs continue to grow, the Corporation continues to monitor the development and usage of ARRs, including the Secured Overnight Financing Rate. Additionally, any prolonged economic and market disruptions resulting from COVID-19 may have an adverse impact on the market and industry transition to ARRs, including the readiness of other market participants and third-party vendors, and the Bank of America 4 Corporation engagement with impacted clients and their operational readiness to transition to ARRs. For more information on the expected replacement of LIBOR and other benchmark rates, see Executive Summary - Recent Developments - LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rates in the MD&A and Item 1A. Risk Factors - Other of the Corporation 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information about the Corporation's risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic, see Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors on page 96 . Financial Highlights Effective January 1, 2020, we adopted the new accounting standard on current expected credit losses (CECL), under which the allowance is measured based on management best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses. Prior periods presented reflect measurement of the allowance based on management estimate of probable incurred credit losses. For more information, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Table 2 Summary Income Statement and Selected Financial Data Three Months Ended March 31 (Dollars in millions, except per share information) 2020 2019 Income statement Net interest income $ 12,130 $ 12,375 Noninterest income 10,637 10,629 Total revenue, net of interest expense 22,767 23,004 Provision for credit losses 4,761 1,013 Noninterest expense 13,475 13,224 Income before income taxes 4,531 8,767 Income tax expense 521 1,456 Net income 4,010 7,311 Preferred stock dividends 469 442 Net income applicable to common shareholders $ 3,541 $ 6,869 Per common share information Earnings $ 0.40 $ 0.71 Diluted earnings 0.40 0.70 Dividends paid 0.18 0.15 Performance ratios Return on average assets (1) 0.65 % 1.26 % Return on average common shareholders equity (1) 5.91 11.42 Return on average tangible common shareholders equity (2) 8.32 16.01 Efficiency ratio (1) 59.19 57.48 March 31 2020 December 31 2019 Balance sheet Total loans and leases $ 1,050,785 $ 983,426 Total assets 2,619,954 2,434,079 Total deposits 1,583,325 1,434,803 Total liabilities 2,355,036 2,169,269 Total common shareholders equity 241,491 241,409 Total shareholders equity 264,918 264,810 (1) For definitions, see Key Metrics on page 95 . (2) Return on average tangible common shareholders equity is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information and a corresponding reconciliation to the most closely related financial measures defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 45 . Net income was $4.0 billion , or $0.40 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to $7.3 billion , or $0.70 per diluted share, for the same period in 2019. The decline in net income was largely due to an increase in the provision for credit losses primarily due to the deteriorating economic outlook related to COVID 19, and to a lesser extent, an increase in noninterest expense and lower revenue. Total assets increased $185.9 billion from December 31, 2019 to $2.6 trillion primarily driven by higher cash and cash equivalents due to elevated deposit balances, an increase in loans and leases due to commercial credit line draws as clients secure liquidity under current market conditions, and residential mortgage loan growth, and an increase in federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell as a result of elevated deposit balances being deployed to short-term investments. Total liabilities increased $185.8 billion from December 31, 2019 to $2.4 trillion primarily driven by higher deposits as a result of client responses to market volatility as well as tax refund inflows, an increase in derivative liabilities driven by lower interest rates, and an increase in long-term debt due to debt issuances and a debt basis adjustment primarily due to lower interest rates. Shareholders equity increased $108 million from December 31, 2019 primarily due to market value increases on debt securities and net income, partially offset by returns of capital to shareholders through common stock repurchases and common and preferred stock dividends as well as the impact of the adoption of the new credit loss accounting standard. 5 Bank of America Net Interest Income Net interest income decreased $245 million to $12.1 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. Net interest yield on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis decreased 18 basis points (bps) to 2.33 percent . The decrease in net interest income was primarily driven by lower interest rates, partially offset by one additional day of interest accruals and loan and deposit growth. Based on the forward interest rate curve and other relevant assumptions at March 31, 2020, we expect net interest income of approximately $11 billion in the second quarter of 2020 which should begin to stabilize in the second half of 2020, assuming year-over-year average loan and deposit percentage growth in the mid-single digits across our businesses that would mitigate the impacts of longer-term asset repricing. For more information on net interest yield and the FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 7 , and for more information on interest rate risk management, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 41 . Noninterest Income Table 3 Noninterest Income Three Months Ended March 31 (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 Fees and commissions: Card income $ 1,272 $ 1,375 Service charges 1,903 1,839 Investment and brokerage services 3,758 3,360 Investment banking fees 1,388 1,264 Total fees and commissions 8,321 7,838 Market making and similar activities 2,807 2,768 Other income (491 ) 23 Total noninterest income $ 10,637 $ 10,629 Noninterest income was relatively unchanged at $10.6 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. The following highlights the significant changes in the components of noninterest income. Card income decreased $103 million primarily driven by higher points and rewards expense . Investment and brokerage services income increased $398 million primarily driven by higher market valuations, positive assets under management (AUM) flows and transactional revenue, partially offset by declines in AUM pricing. Investment banking fees increased $124 million due to higher debt and equity underwriting fees. Other income decreased $514 million primarily due to unrealized losses in the fair value option and leveraged finance portfolios, partially offset by higher gains on sales of debt securities. Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses increased $3.7 billion to $4.8 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to a deteriorating economic outlook related to COVID-19. For more information on the provision for credit losses, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 38 . Noninterest Expense Table 4 Noninterest Expense Three Months Ended March 31 (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 Compensation and benefits $ 8,341 $ 8,249 Occupancy and equipment 1,702 1,605 Information processing and communications 1,209 1,164 Product delivery and transaction related 777 662 Marketing 438 442 Professional fees 375 360 Other general operating 633 742 Total noninterest expense $ 13,475 $ 13,224 Noninterest expense increased $251 million to $13.5 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. The increase was primarily due to investments across the franchise including in client-facing associates, employee compensation programs, technology and real estate, and an increase in revenue-related expenses, which were partially offset by efficiency savings. Income Tax Expense Table 5 Income Tax Expense Three Months Ended March 31 (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 Income before income taxes $ 4,531 $ 8,767 Income tax expense 521 1,456 Effective tax rate 11.5 % 16.6 % The effective tax rates for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 were primarily driven by our recurring tax preference benefits and tax benefits from deductions associated with share-based compensation. The decline in the effective tax rate resulted from lower pretax income. We expect the effective tax rate for full-year 2020 to be approximately 14 to 15 percent, absent unusual items. Bank of America 6 Supplemental Financial Data Non-GAAP Financial Measures In this Form 10-Q, we present certain non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items or otherwise include components that differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional useful information to assess our financial condition, results of operations (including period-to-period operating performance) or compliance with prospective regulatory requirements. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same way as non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. We view net interest income and related ratios and analyses on an FTE basis, which when presented on a consolidated basis are non-GAAP financial measures. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 21 percent and a representative state tax rate. Net interest yield, which measures the basis points we earn over the cost of funds, utilizes net interest income on an FTE basis. We believe that presentation of these items on an FTE basis allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practices. We may present certain key performance indicators and ratios excluding certain items (e.g., debit valuation adjustment (DVA) gains (losses)) which result in non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the presentation of measures that exclude these items is useful because such measures provide additional information to assess the underlying operational performance and trends of our businesses and to allow better comparison of period-to-period operating performance. We also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents shareholders equity or common shareholders equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)), net of related deferred tax liabilities ("adjusted" shareholders' equity or common shareholders' equity). These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models use both return on average tangible common shareholders equity and return on average tangible shareholders equity as key measures to support our overall growth goals. These ratios are as follows: Return on average tangible common shareholders equity measures our net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average common shareholders equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders equity divided by total tangible assets. Return on average tangible shareholders' equity measures our net income as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders equity divided by total tangible assets. Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders equity divided by ending common shares outstanding. We believe that the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. Tangible book value per common share provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation to outstanding shares of common stock. The aforementioned supplemental data and performance measures are presented in Tables 6 and 7 . For more information on the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 45 . Key Performance Indicators We present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance indicators (key performance indicators) that management uses when assessing our consolidated and/or segment results. We believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information about our underlying operational performance and trends. These key performance indicators (KPIs) may not be defined or calculated in the same way as similar KPIs used by other companies.

We manage our segments and report their results on an FTE basis. For more information, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . We periodically review capital allocated to our businesses and allocate capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. We utilize a methodology that considers the effect of regulatory capital requirements in addition to internal risk-based capital models. Our internal risk-based capital models use a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment credit, market, interest rate, business and operational risk components. For more information on the nature of these risks, see Managing Risk on page 18 . The capital allocated to the business segments is referred to as allocated capital. Allocated equity in the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting unit. For more information, see Note 7 Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements . For more information on our presentation of financial information on an FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 7 , and for reconciliations to consolidated total revenue, net income and period-end total assets, see Note 17 Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Key Performance Indicators We present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance indicators that management uses when evaluating segment results. We believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information about our segments operational performance, customer trends and business growth.

As a result, total earning assets and total assets of the businesses may not equal total Consumer Banking . Consumer Banking, which is comprised of Deposits and Consumer Lending, offers a diversified range of credit, banking and investment products and services to consumers and small businesses. For more information about Consumer Banking, including our Deposits and Consumer Lending businesses, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Consumer Banking Results Net income for Consumer Banking decreased $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to Bank of America 10 the same period in 2019 primarily due to an increase in the provision for credit losses and lower revenue. Net interest income decreased $244 million to $6.9 billion primarily due to lower interest rates partially offset by higher deposit and loan balances in the quarter. Noninterest income decreased $259 million to $2.3 billion driven by lower other income due to the allocation of asset and liability management (ALM) results and a decline in card income. The provision for credit losses increased $1.3 billion to $2.3 billion primarily due to the impact of COVID-19. Noninterest expense increased $128 million to $4.5 billion primarily driven by the cost of increased client activity and continued investments for business growth, partially offset by improved productivity and lower support costs. The return on average allocated capital was 19 percent, down from 36 percent, driven by lower net income and, to a lesser extent, an increase in allocated capital. For information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 10 . Deposits Net income for Deposits decreased $498 million to $1.7 billion driven by lower net interest income and noninterest income. Net interest income declined $359 million to $3.9 billion primarily due to lower interest rates, partially offset by growth in deposits. Noninterest income decreased $161 million to $1.1 billion primarily driven by lower other income due to the allocation of ALM results and lower service charges. The provision for credit losses increased $69 million to $115 million primarily due to the impact of COVID-19. Noninterest expense increased $70 million to $2.7 billion driven by continued investments in the business, partially offset by operating efficiencies. Average deposits increased $39.0 billion to $731.3 billion driven by strong organic growth. Growth in checking and time deposits of $36.3 billion was coupled with growth in traditional savings and money market savings of $ 2.6 billion . The following table provides key performance indicators for Deposits. Management uses these metrics, and we believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information to evaluate our deposit profitability and mobile/digital trends. Key Statistics Deposits Three Months Ended March 31 2020 2019 Total deposit spreads (excludes noninterest costs) (1) 2.17 % 2.38 % Period End Consumer investment assets (in millions) (2) $ 212,227 $ 210,930 Active digital banking users (units in thousands) (3) 39,075 37,034 Active mobile banking users (units in thousands) (4) 29,820 27,127 Financial centers 4,297 4,353 ATMs 16,855 16,378 (1) Includes deposits held in Consumer Lending.

(4) Active mobile banking users represents mobile users over the last three months. Consumer investment assets increased $1.3 billion driven by client flows offset by market performance. Active mobile banking users increased three million reflecting continuing changes in our customers banking preferences. The number of financial centers declined by a net 56 reflecting changes in customer preferences to self-service options as we continue to optimize our consumer banking network and improve our cost to serve. Consumer Lending Net income for Consumer Lending decreased $948 million to $139 million primarily due to an increase in the provision for credit losses. Revenue of $4.1 billion was relatively unchanged. Net interest income increased $115 million to $2.9 billion driven by loan growth. Noninterest income decreased $98 million to $1.2 billion primarily driven by lower card income. The provision for credit losses increased $1.2 billion to $2.1 billion primarily due to the impact of COVID-19. Noninterest expense increased $58 million to $1.8 billion primarily driven by investments in the business. Average loans increased $24.6 billion to $311.5 billion primarily driven by an increase in residential mortgages. The following table provides key performance indicators for Consumer Lending. Management uses these metrics, and we believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information about loan growth and profitability. Key Statistics Consumer Lending Three Months Ended March 31 (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 Total credit card (1) Gross interest yield (2) 10.49 % 10.80 % Risk-adjusted margin (3) 7.94 8.03 New accounts (in thousands) 1,055 1,034 Purchase volumes $ 64,379 $ 62,751 Debit card purchase volumes $ 88,588 $ 85,030 (1) Includes GWIM's credit card portfolio. (2) Calculated as the effective annual percentage rate divided by average loans. (3) Calculated as the difference between total revenue less net credit losses divided by average loans. During the three months ended March 31, 2020 , the total credit card risk-adjusted margin decreased 9 bps, primarily driven by a portfolio shift away from promotional-rate loans. Total credit card purchase volumes increased $1.6 billion to $64.4 billion , and debit card purchase volumes increased $3.6 billion to $88.6 billion , reflecting higher levels of consumer spending. Key Statistics Loan Production (1) Three Months Ended March 31 (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 Consumer Banking: First mortgage $ 12,881 $ 8,155 Home equity $ 2,641 $ 2,485 Total (2) : First mortgage $ 18,938 $ 11,460 Home equity 3,024 2,825 (1) The loan production amounts represent the unpaid principal balance of loans and, in the case of home equity, the principal amount of the total line of credit. (2) In addition to loan production in Consumer Banking , there is also first mortgage and home equity loan production in GWIM. First mortgage loan originations in Consumer Banking and for the total Corporation increased $4.7 billion and $7.5 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily driven by a lower interest rate environment driving higher first-lien mortgage refinances. Home equity production in Consumer Banking and for the total Corporation increased $156 million and $199 million , primarily driven by higher demand. 11 Bank of America Global Wealth & Investment Management Three Months Ended March 31 (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 % Change Net interest income $ 1,571 $ 1,684 (7 )% Noninterest income: Investment and brokerage services 3,122 2,842 10 All other income 243 294 (17 ) Total noninterest income 3,365 3,136 7 Total revenue, net of interest expense 4,936 4,820 2 Provision for credit losses 189 5 n/m Noninterest expense 3,600 3,434 5 Income before income taxes 1,147 1,381 (17 ) Income tax expense 281 338 (17 ) Net income $ 866 $ 1,043 (17 ) Effective tax rate 24.5 % 24.5 % Net interest yield 2.17 2.40 Return on average allocated capital 23 29 Efficiency ratio 72.95 71.25 Balance Sheet Three Months Ended March 31 Average 2020 2019 % Change Total loans and leases $ 178,639 $ 164,403 9 % Total earning assets 290,916 285,050 2 Total assets 303,173 297,133 2 Total deposits 263,411 261,841 1 Allocated capital 15,000 14,500 3 Period end March 31 2020 December 31 2019 % Change Total loans and leases $ 181,492 $ 176,600 3 % Total earning assets 311,118 287,195 8 Total assets 323,866 299,770 8 Total deposits 282,395 263,113 7 n/m = not meaningful GWIM consists of two primary businesses: Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management (MLGWM) and Bank of America Private Bank. For more information about GWIM , see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Net income for GWIM decreased $177 million to $866 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 due to higher provision for credit losses, higher noninterest expense and lower net interest income, partially offset by higher noninterest income. The operating margin was 23 percent compared to 29 percent a year ago. Net interest income decreased $113 million to $1.6 billion due to the impact of lower interest rates, partially offset by the impact of growth in loans and deposits. Noninterest income, which primarily includes investment and brokerage services income, increased $229 million to $3.4 billion . The increase was primarily driven by higher market valuations, positive AUM flows and increased transactional revenue, partially offset by declines in AUM pricing compared to the same period in 2019 . The provision for credit losses increased $184 million to $189 million primarily due to the impact of COVID-19. Noninterest expense increased $166 million to $3.6 billion , primarily due to higher revenue-related incentives along with investments for business growth. The return on average allocated capital was 23 percent, down from 29 percent, due to lower net income and, to a lesser extent, a small increase in allocated capital. MLGWM revenue of $4.1 billion increased three percent primarily driven by higher market valuations, positive AUM flows and increased transactional revenue, partially offset by decreases in net interest income and AUM pricing. Bank of America Private Bank revenue of $863 million increased one percent primarily driven by higher market valuations partially offset by lower net interest income.

The decrease in client balances was primarily due to lower end of period market valuations partially offset by positive net flows. 13 Bank of America Global Banking Three Months Ended March 31 (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 % Change Net interest income $ 2,612 $ 2,790 (6 %) Noninterest income: Service charges 796 713 12 Investment banking fees 761 709 7 All other income 431 943 (54 ) Total noninterest income 1,988 2,365 (16 ) Total revenue, net of interest expense 4,600 5,155 (11 ) Provision for credit losses 2,093 111 n/m Noninterest expense 2,321 2,266 2 Income before income taxes 186 2,778 (93 ) Income tax expense 50 750 (93 ) Net income $ 136 $ 2,028 (93 ) Effective tax rate 27.0 % 27.0 % Net interest yield 2.57 2.98 Return on average allocated capital 1 20 Efficiency ratio 50.44 43.96 Balance Sheet Three Months Ended March 31 Average 2020 2019 % Change Total loans and leases $ 386,483 $ 370,108 4 % Total earning assets 409,052 380,308 8 Total assets 465,926 434,920 7 Total deposits 382,373 349,037 10 Allocated capital 42,500 41,000 4 Period end March 31 2020 December 31 2019 % Change Total loans and leases $ 437,122 $ 379,268 15 % Total earning assets 505,451 407,180 24 Total assets 562,529 464,032 21 Total deposits 477,108 383,180 25 n/m = not meaningful Global Banking , which includes Global Corporate Banking, Global Commercial Banking, Business Banking and Global Investment Banking, provides a wide range of lending-related products and services, integrated working capital management and treasury solutions, and underwriting and advisory services through our network of offices and client relationship teams . For more information about Global Banking, ee Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Net income for Global Banking decreased $1.9 billion to $136 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily driven by higher provision for credit losses, and to a lesser extent, lower revenue. Revenue decreased $555 million to $4.6 billion driven by lower net interest income and noninterest income. Net interest income decreased $178 million to $2.6 billion primarily due to the allocation of ALM results and spread compression, partially offset by growth in loan and deposit balances. Noninterest income decreased $377 million to $2.0 billion primarily due to valuation adjustments on leveraged loans and the fair value option loan portfolio, partially offset by higher investment banking fees. The provision for credit losses increased $2.0 billion to $2.1 billion primarily due to the impact of COVID-19. Noninterest expense increased $55 million primarily due to continued investment in the business, partially offset by lower revenue-related incentives. The return on average allocated capital was one percent in 2020 compared to 20 percent in 2019 , due to lower net income and, to a lesser extent, an increase in allocated capital. For information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 10 . Global Corporate, Global Commercial and Business Banking The table below and following discussion present a summary of the results, which exclude certain investment banking activities in Global Banking .

The decrease was primarily driven by valuation adjustments on loans in the fair value option portfolio, partly offset by the impact of higher loan and lease balances. Global Transaction Services revenue decreased $159 million driven by the allocation of ALM results, partially offset by the impact of higher deposit balances. Average loans and leases increased four percent driven by growth in the commercial and industrial loan portfolio. Average deposits increased 10 percent due to growth in domestic and international interest-bearing balances. Global Investment Banking Client teams and product specialists underwrite and distribute debt, equity and loan products, and provide advisory services and tailored risk management solutions. The economics of certain investment banking and underwriting activities are shared primarily between Global Banking and Global Markets under an internal revenue-sharing arrangement. Global Banking originates certain deal-related transactions with our corporate and commercial clients that are executed and distributed by Global Markets . To provide a complete discussion of our consolidated investment banking fees, the following table presents total Corporation investment banking fees and the portion attributable to Global Banking. Investment Banking Fees Global Banking Total Corporation Three Months Ended March 31 (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2020 2019 Products Advisory $ 247 $ 303 $ 269 $ 343 Debt issuance 424 327 927 748 Equity issuance 90 79 283 234 Gross investment banking fees 761 709 1,479 1,325 Self-led deals (43 ) (20 ) (91 ) (61 ) Total investment banking fees $ 718 $ 689 $ 1,388 $ 1,264 Total Corporation investment banking fees, excluding self-led deals, of $1.4 billion , which are primarily included within Global Banking and Global Markets , increased 10 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily driven by higher debt and equity issuance fees, partially offset by lower advisory fees. 15 Bank of America Global Markets Three Months Ended March 31 (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 % Change Net interest income $ 1,153 $ 953 21 % Noninterest income: Investment and brokerage services 567 444 28 Investment banking fees 602 537 12 Market making and similar activities 2,973 2,082 43 All other income (70 ) 165 (142 ) Total noninterest income 4,072 3,228 26 Total revenue, net of interest expense 5,225 4,181 25 Provision for credit losses 107 (23 ) n/m Noninterest expense 2,813 2,755 2 Income before income taxes 2,305 1,449 59 Income tax expense 599 413 45 Net income $ 1,706 $ 1,036 65 Effective tax rate 26.0 % 28.5 % Return on average allocated capital 19 12 Efficiency ratio 53.82 65.91 Balance Sheet Three Months Ended March 31 Average 2020 2019 % Change Trading-related assets: Trading account securities $ 257,254 $ 225,254 14 % Reverse repurchases 115,698 122,753 (6 ) Securities borrowed 83,271 84,343 (1 ) Derivative assets 46,825 41,953 12 Total trading-related assets 503,048 474,303 6 Total loans and leases 71,660 70,080 2 Total earning assets 501,616 472,414 6 Total assets 712,980 664,052 7 Total deposits 33,323 31,366 6 Allocated capital 36,000 35,000 3 Period end March 31 2020 December 31 2019 % Change Total trading-related assets $ 439,480 $ 452,496 (3 )% Total loans and leases 78,591 72,993 8 Total earning assets 465,632 471,701 (1 ) Total assets 654,735 641,806 2 Total deposits 38,536 34,676 11 n/m = not meaningful Global Markets offers sales and trading services and research services to institutional clients across fixed-income, credit, currency, commodity and equity businesses .

For more information about Global Markets, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . The following explanations for current period-over-period changes in results for Global Markets , including those disclosed under Sales and Trading Revenue, exclude net DVA, but the explanations would be the same if net DVA were included. Revenue amounts excluding net DVA are a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information on net DVA, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 7 . Net income for Global Markets increased $670 million to $1.7 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 . Net DVA gains were $300 million compared to losses of $90 million during the same period in 2019 . Excluding net DVA, net income increased $374 million to $1.5 billion . These increases were primarily driven by an increase in revenue, partially offset by higher noninterest expense and an increase in the provision for credit losses. Revenue increased $1.0 billion to $5.2 billion as sales and trading revenue increased $1.2 billion , and excluding net DVA, increased $782 million . These increases were driven by higher revenue across Equities and Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC). The provision for credit losses increased $130 million primarily due to the impact of COVID-19. Noninterest expense increased $58 million to $2.8 billion primarily driven by higher revenue-related expenses. Average total assets increased $48.9 billion to $713.0 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to increased levels of inventory in FICC to facilitate expected client demand and higher client balances in Equities. Period-end total assets increased $12.9 billion since December 31, 2019 to $654.7 billion primarily driven by higher loan and derivative balances in FICC. The return on average allocated capital was 19 percent , up from 12 percent , reflecting higher net income, partially offset by a small increase in allocated capital.

(4) FICC and Equities sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, is a non-GAAP financial measure. FICC net DVA gains were $274 million and losses of $79 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 . Equities net DVA gains were $26 million and losses of $11 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 . FICC revenue increased $311 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 driven by increased client activity and improved market making conditions across macro products, partially offset by weaker performances in credit sensitive businesses. Equities revenue increased $471 million driven by increased client activity and a strong trading performance in the more volatile market environment.

Average allocated assets were $572.2 billion and $542.5 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 , and period-end allocated assets were $665.8 billion and $565.4 billion at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . n/m = not meaningful All Other consists of ALM activities, equity investments, non-core mortgage loans and servicing activities, liquidating businesses and certain expenses not otherwise allocated to a business segment. ALM activities encompass certain residential mortgages, debt securities, and interest rate and foreign currency risk management activities. Substantially all of the results of ALM activities are allocated to our business segments . For more information on our ALM activities, see Note 17 Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Equity investments include our merchant services joint venture, as well as a portfolio of equity, real estate and other alternative investments . For information on our merchant services joint venture, see Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements . For more information about All Other, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 17 Bank of America Residential mortgage loans that are held for ALM purposes, including interest rate or liquidity risk management, are classified as core and are presented on the balance sheet of All Other . During the three months ended March 31, 2020 , residential mortgage loans held for ALM activities decreased $416 million to $21.3 billion primarily as a result of payoffs and paydowns. Non-core residential mortgage and home equity loans, which are principally runoff portfolios, are also held in All Other . During the three months ended March 31, 2020 , total non-core loans decreased $806 million to $14.9 billion due primarily to payoffs and paydowns, as well as Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan conveyances, partially offset by repurchases. For more information on the composition of the core and non-core portfolios, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 25 . The net loss for All Other increased $456 million , driven by lower revenue and higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower noninterest expense. Revenue decreased $348 million due primarily to certain valuation adjustments in noninterest income. Noninterest expense decreased $156 million to $246 million primarily due to lower incentive compensation. The income tax benefit decreased $96 million reflecting a lower level of tax preference benefits recognized in the quarter, partially offset by the impact of higher pretax losses. Both periods included income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking . Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have contractual obligations to make future payments on debt and lease agreements. Additionally, in the normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements whereby we commit to future purchases of products or services from unaffiliated parties. For more information on obligations and commitments, see Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein, as well as Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations in the MD&A of the Corporation 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K , and Note 12 Long-term Debt and Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Representations and Warranties Obligations For more information on representations and warranties obligations in connection with the sale of mortgage loans, see Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Managing Risk Risk is inherent in all our business activities. The seven key types of risk faced by the Corporation are strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational. Sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver for our shareholders. If not managed well, risks can result in financial loss, regulatory sanctions and penalties, and damage to our reputation, each of which may adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategies. We take a comprehensive approach to risk management with a defined Risk Framework and an articulated Risk Appetite Statement which are approved annually by the Enterprise Risk Committee and the Board. Our Risk Framework serves as the foundation for the consistent and effective management of risks facing the Corporation. The Risk Framework sets forth clear roles, responsibilities and accountability for the management of risk and provides a blueprint for how the Board, through delegation of authority to committees and executive officers, establishes risk appetite and associated limits for our activities. Our Risk Appetite Statement is intended to ensure that the Corporation maintains an acceptable risk profile by providing a common framework and a comparable set of measures for senior management and the Board to clearly indicate the level of risk the Corporation is willing to accept. Risk appetite is set at least annually and is aligned with the Corporation strategic, capital and financial operating plans. Our line of business strategies and risk appetite are also similarly aligned. For more information about the Corporation's risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic, see Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors on page 96 . These COVID-19 related risks are being managed within our Risk Framework and supporting risk management programs. For more information on our Risk Framework, our risk management activities and the key types of risk faced by the Corporation, see the Managing Risk through Reputational Risk sections in the MD&A of the Corporation 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Capital Management The Corporation manages its capital position so that its capital is more than adequate to support its business activities and aligns with risk, risk appetite and strategic planning. For more information on capital management, including related regulatory requirements, see Capital Management in the MD&A of the Corporation 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . CCAR and Capital Planning During the first quarter of 2020, we repurchased $6.4 billion of common stock pursuant to the Board authorization. For more information, see Capital Management -- CCAR and Capital Planning in the MD&A of the Corporation 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . As announced on March 15, 2020, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy, we temporarily suspended common stock repurchases from the date of the announcement through the end of the second quarter of 2020. We made this decision to enable us to provide maximum support to our customers and the broader economy through lending and other services. The suspension does not include repurchases to offset shares issued under equity compensation plans. As a well-capitalized financial institution, we may reinstate our repurchase program at such time as our Board deems advisable, taking into account economic conditions and other considerations. At such time that we reinstate our stock repurchase program, our stock repurchases will be subject to various factors, including the Corporation capital position, liquidity, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock trading price and general market conditions, and may be suspended at any time. The repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including repurchase plans that satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). The Federal Reserve requires BHCs to submit a capital plan and planned capital actions on an annual basis, consistent with the rules governing the CCAR capital plan. In April 2020, we submitted our 2020 CCAR capital plan and related supervisory stress tests. The Federal Reserve has announced that it will disclose CCAR capital plan supervisory stress test results by June 30, 2020. These results will determine the stress test depletion Bank of America 18 used in the calculation of the Corporation stress capital buffer under the final rule published by the Federal Reserve in March 2020. For more information, see Regulatory Developments in this section. Regulatory Capital As a financial services holding company, we are subject to regulatory capital rules, including Basel 3, issued by U.S. banking regulators. The Corporation's depository institution subsidiaries are also subject to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. The Corporation and its primary affiliated banking entity, BANA, are Advanced approaches institutions under Basel 3 and are required to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and risk-weighted assets under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is used to assess capital adequacy including under the PCA framework. As of March 31, 2020 , the Common equity tier 1 (CET1) and Tier 1 capital ratios for the Corporation were lower under the Standardized approach whereas the Advanced approaches yielded a lower Total capital ratio. Minimum Capital Requirements In order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments, the Corporation must meet risk-based capital ratio requirements that include a capital conservation buffer greater than 2.5 percent, plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer and a global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge. The buffers and surcharge must be comprised solely of CET1 capital. The Corporation is also required to maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Our insured depository institution subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be considered well capitalized under the PCA framework. Capital Composition and Ratios Table 8 presents Bank of America Corporation capital ratios and related information in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced approaches as measured at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . For the periods presented herein, the Corporation met the definition of well capitalized under current regulatory requirements. Table 8 Bank of America Corporation Regulatory Capital under Basel 3 Standardized Approach (1) Advanced Approaches (1) Regulatory Minimum (2) (Dollars in millions, except as noted) March 31, 2020 Risk-based capital metrics: Common equity tier 1 capital $ 168,115 $ 168,115 Tier 1 capital 191,532 191,532 Total capital (3) 228,511 221,009 Risk-weighted assets (in billions) 1,561 1,512 Common equity tier 1 capital ratio 10.8 % 11.1 % 9.5 % Tier 1 capital ratio 12.3 12.7 11.0 Total capital ratio 14.6 14.6 13.0 Leverage-based metrics: Adjusted quarterly average assets (in billions) (4) $ 2,422 $ 2,422 Tier 1 leverage ratio 7.9 % 7.9 % 4.0 SLR leverage exposure (in billions) $ 2,984 SLR 6.4 % 5.0 December 31, 2019 Risk-based capital metrics: Common equity tier 1 capital $ 166,760 $ 166,760 Tier 1 capital 188,492 188,492 Total capital (3) 221,230 213,098 Risk-weighted assets (in billions) 1,493 1,447 Common equity tier 1 capital ratio 11.2 % 11.5 % 9.5 % Tier 1 capital ratio 12.6 13.0 11.0 Total capital ratio 14.8 14.7 13.0 Leverage-based metrics: Adjusted quarterly average assets (in billions) (4) $ 2,374 $ 2,374 Tier 1 leverage ratio 7.9 % 7.9 % 4.0 SLR leverage exposure (in billions) $ 2,946 SLR 6.4 % 5.0 (1) As of March 31, 2020 , capital ratios are calculated using the regulatory capital rule that allows a five-year transition period related to the adoption of CECL. (2) The capital conservation buffer and G-SIB surcharge were 2.5 percent at both March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . The countercyclical capital buffer for both periods was zero . The SLR minimum includes a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent. (3) Total capital under the Advanced approaches differs from the Standardized approach due to differences in the amount permitted in Tier 2 capital related to the qualifying allowance for credit losses. (4) Reflects total average assets adjusted for certain Tier 1 capital deductions. At March 31, 2020 , CET1 capital was $168.1 billion , an increase of $1.4 billion from December 31, 2019 , driven by earnings and net unrealized gains on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities included in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI), partially offset by common stock repurchases and dividends. Total capital under the Advanced approaches increased $7.9 billion primarily driven by the same factors as CET1 capital, increases in excess eligible credit reserves included in Tier 2 capital and issuance of preferred stock. Risk-weighted assets under the Standardized approach, which yielded the lower CET1 19 Bank of America capital ratio at March 31, 2020 , increased $ 67.6 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2020 to $1,561 billion primarily due to increased exposure in Global Markets and increased loan revolver draws in Global Banking .

(2) Risk-based capital regulatory minimums at March 31, 2020 are the minimum ratios under Basel 3 including a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent . The regulatory minimums for the leverage ratios as of both period ends and risk-based capital ratios as of December 31, 2019 are the percent required to be considered well capitalized under the PCA framework. (3) Total capital under the Advanced approaches differs from the Standardized approach due to differences in the amount permitted in Tier 2 capital related to the qualifying allowance for credit losses. (4) Reflects total average assets adjusted for certain Tier 1 capital deductions. Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity Requirements Total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) consists of the Corporation Tier 1 capital and eligible long-term debt issued directly by the Corporation. Eligible long-term debt for TLAC ratios is comprised of unsecured debt that has a remaining maturity of at least one year and satisfies additional requirements as prescribed in the TLAC final rule. As with the risk-based capital ratios and SLR, the Corporation is required to maintain TLAC ratios in excess of minimum requirements plus applicable buffers to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Table 12 presents the Corporation's TLAC and long-term debt ratios and related information as of March 31, 2020 . Table 12 Bank of America Corporation Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity and Long-Term Debt TLAC (1) Regulatory Minimum (2) Long-term Debt Regulatory Minimum (3) (Dollars in millions) March 31, 2020 Total eligible balance $ 383,281 $ 181,135 Percentage of risk-weighted assets (4) 24.6 % 22.0 % 11.6 % 8.5 % Percentage of SLR leverage exposure 12.8 9.5 6.1 4.5 December 31, 2019 Total eligible balance $ 367,449 $ 171,349 Percentage of risk-weighted assets (4) 24.6 % 22.0 % 11.5 % 8.5 % Percentage of SLR leverage exposure 12.5 9.5 5.8 4.5 (1) As of March 31, 2020 , TLAC ratios are calculated using the regulatory capital rule that allows a five-year transition period related to the adoption of CECL. (2) The TLAC risk-weighted assets regulatory minimum consists of 18.0 percent plus a TLAC risk-weighted assets buffer comprised of 2.5 percent plus the method 1 G-SIB surcharge of 1.5 percent. The countercyclical buffer is zero for both periods. The TLAC SLR leverage exposure regulatory minimum consists of 7.5 percent plus a 2.0 percent TLAC leverage buffer. The TLAC risk-weighted assets and leverage buffers must be comprised solely of CET1 capital and Tier 1 capital, respectively. (3) The long-term debt risk-weighted assets regulatory minimum is comprised of 6.0 percent plus an additional 2.5 percent requirement based on the Corporation method 2 G-SIB surcharge. The long-term debt leverage exposure regulatory minimum is 4.5 percent . (4) The approach that yields the higher risk-weighted assets is used to calculate TLAC and long-term debt ratios, which was the Standardized approach as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . 21 Bank of America Regulatory Developments The following supplements the disclosure in Capital Management Regulatory Developments in the MD&A of the Corporation 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Revisions to Basel 3 to Address Current Expected Credit Loss Accounting On January 1, 2020, the Corporation adopted the new accounting standard that requires the measurement of the allowance for credit losses to be based on management best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the Corporation's relevant financial assets. For more information, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements . On March 27, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. banking regulators issued an interim final rule that the Corporation adopted to delay for two years the initial adoption impact of CECL on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of the capital benefit provided during 2020 and 2021 (i.e., a five-year transition period). During the two-year delay, the Corporation will add back to CET1 capital 100 percent of the initial adoption impact of CECL plus 25 percent of the cumulative quarterly changes in the allowance for credit losses (i.e., quarterly transitional amounts). After two years, starting on January 1, 2022, the quarterly transitional amounts along with the initial adoption impact of CECL will be phased out of CET1 capital over the three-year period. Stress Capital Buffer On March 4, 2020, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule that integrates the annual quantitative assessment of the CCAR program with the buffer requirements in the U.S. Basel 3 Final Rule. The new approach replaces the existing static 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer for Basel 3 Standardized approach requirements with a stress capital buffer, calculated as the decline in the CET1 capital ratio under the supervisory severely adverse scenario plus four quarters of planned common stock dividends, floored at 2.5 percent. The stress capital buffer requirement is effective October 1, 2020. The Corporation will receive its stress capital buffer in its 2020 CCAR results. In conjunction with this new requirement, the Federal Reserve has removed the annual CCAR quantitative objection process beginning with CCAR 2020. While the final rule continues to require that the Corporation describe its planned capital distributions in its CCAR capital plan, the Corporation is no longer required to seek prior approval if it makes capital distributions in excess of those included in its CCAR capital plan. The Corporation is instead subject to automatic distribution limitations if its capital ratios fall below its buffer requirements, which include the stress capital buffer. Eligible Retained Income On March 17, 2020, in response to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issued an interim final rule that revises the definition of eligible retained income to be based on average net income over the prior four quarters. This change would more gradually phase in automatic distribution restrictions to the extent capital buffers are breached. Supplementary Leverage Ratio On April 1, 2020, in response to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve issued an interim final rule to temporarily exclude the on-balance sheet amounts of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from the calculation of SLR leverage exposure for bank holding companies. The rule is effective for June 30, 2020 through March 31, 2021 reports. Paycheck Protection Program Loans On April 9, 2020, in response to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC issued an interim final rule that excludes loans pledged as collateral to the Federal Reserve PPP Lending Facility from SLR leverage exposure, average total consolidated assets, and Advanced and Standardized risk-weighted assets. Additionally, PPP loans, which are guaranteed by the Small Business Administration, will receive a zero percent risk weight under the Basel 3 Advanced and Standardized approaches. For more information on the PPP , see Executive Summary - Recent Developments COVID-19 Pandemic 2020 on page 3 . Volcker Rule In 2019, U.S. financial regulators finalized certain changes to the Volcker Rule, including removing the requirement for banking organizations to deduct from Tier 1 capital ownership interests of covered funds acquired or retained under the underwriting or market-making exemptions of the Volcker Rule, which the banking entity did not organize or offer. This change became effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2020. Regulatory Capital and Securities Regulation The Corporation principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are BofA Securities, Inc. (BofAS), Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp. (MLPCC) and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (MLPF&S). BofAS was formed as a result of the reorganization of MLPF&S which was completed in May 2019. The Corporation's principal European broker-dealer subsidiaries are Merrill Lynch International (MLI) and BofA Securities Europe SA (BofASE). The U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the net capital requirements of Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act. BofAS computes its minimum capital requirements as an alternative net capital broker-dealer under Rule 15c3-1, and MLPCC and MLPF&S compute their minimum capital requirements in accordance with the alternative standard under Rule 15c3-1. BofAS and MLPCC are also registered as futures commission merchants and are subject to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Regulation 1.17. BofAS provides institutional services, and in accordance with the alternative net capital requirements, is required to maintain tentative net capital in excess of $1.0 billion and net capital in excess of the greater of $500 million or a certain percentage of its reserve requirement. BofAS must also notify the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the event its tentative net capital is less than $5.0 billion. BofAS is also required to hold a certain percentage of its risk-based margin in order to meet its CFTC minimum net capital requirement. At March 31, 2020 , BofAS had tentative net capital of $15.9 billion. BofAS also had regulatory net capital of $12.0 billion which exceeded the minimum requirement of $3.4 billion. MLPCC is a fully-guaranteed subsidiary of BofAS and provides clearing and settlement services. At March 31, 2020 , MLPCC regulatory net capital of $5.9 billion exceeded the minimum requirement of $1.0 billion. MLPF&S provides retail services. At March 31, 2020 , MLPF&S' regulatory net capital was $4.1 billion which exceeded the minimum requirement of $102 million. Our European broker-dealers are regulated by non-U.S. regulators. MLI, a U.K. investment firm, is regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority Bank of America 22 and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. At March 31, 2020 , MLI capital resources were $34.6 billion, which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $14.6 billion. BofASE, a French investment firm, is regulated by the Autorit de Contr le Prudentiel et de R solution and the Autorit des March Financiers, and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. At March 31, 2020 , BofASE's capital resources were $5.3 billion which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $2.1 billion. Liquidity Risk Funding and Liquidity Risk Management Our primary liquidity risk management objective is to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral needs while continuing to support our businesses and customers under a range of economic conditions. To achieve that objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk under expected and stressed conditions, maintain liquidity and access to diverse funding sources, including our stable deposit base, and seek to align liquidity-related incentives and risks. These liquidity risk management practices have allowed us to effectively manage the market stress that began in the first quarter of 2020 from the COVID-19 pandemic. For more information on the effects of the pandemic, see Executive Summary - Recent Developments COVID-19 Pandemic 2020 on page 3 . We define liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we can use to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations as those obligations arise. We manage our liquidity position through line of business and ALM activities, as well as through our legal entity funding strategy, on both a forward and current (including intraday) basis under both expected and stressed conditions. We believe that a centralized approach to funding and liquidity management enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding sources, minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events. For more information regarding global funding and liquidity risk management, as well as liquidity sources, liquidity arrangements, contingency planning and credit ratings discussed below, see Liquidity Risk in the MD&A of the Corporation 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . NB Holdings Corporation We have intercompany arrangements with certain key subsidiaries under which we transferred certain assets of Bank of America Corporation, as the parent company, which is a separate and distinct legal entity from our banking and nonbank subsidiaries, and agreed to transfer certain additional parent company assets not needed to satisfy anticipated near-term expenditures, to NB Holdings Corporation, a wholly-owned holding company subsidiary (NB Holdings). The parent company is expected to continue to have access to the same flow of dividends, interest and other amounts of cash necessary to service its debt, pay dividends and perform other obligations as it would have had if it had not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets. These arrangements support our preferred single point of entry resolution strategy, under which only the parent company would be resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Global Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets Table 13 presents average Global Liquidity Sources (GLS) for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . Table 13 Average Global Liquidity Sources Three Months Ended (Dollars in billions) March 31 2020 December 31 2019 Parent company and NB Holdings $ 50 $ 59 Bank subsidiaries 451 454 Other regulated entities 64 63 Total Average Global Liquidity Sources $ 565 $ 576 We maintain liquidity available to the Corporation, including the parent company and selected subsidiaries, in the form of cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Typically, parent company and NB Holdings liquidity is in the form of cash deposited with BANA. Our bank subsidiaries liquidity is primarily driven by deposit and lending activity, as well as securities valuation and net debt activity. Liquidity at bank subsidiaries excludes the cash deposited by the parent company and NB Holdings. Our bank subsidiaries can also generate incremental liquidity by pledging a range of unencumbered loans and securities to certain Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against this pool of specifically-identified eligible assets was $359 billion and $372 billion at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . We have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against these assets, including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loans and securities collateral. Eligibility is defined in guidelines from the FHLBs and the Federal Reserve and is subject to change at their discretion. Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries can generally be used only to fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries, and transfers to the parent company or nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to prior regulatory approval. Liquidity held in other regulated entities, comprised primarily of broker-dealer subsidiaries, is primarily available to meet the obligations of that entity and transfers to the parent company or to any other subsidiary may be subject to prior regulatory approval due to regulatory restrictions and minimum requirements. Our other regulated entities also hold unencumbered investment-grade securities and equities that we believe could be used to generate additional liquidity. Table 14 presents the composition of average GLS for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . Table 14 Average Global Liquidity Sources Composition Three Months Ended (Dollars in billions) March 31 2020 December 31 2019 Cash on deposit $ 113 $ 103 U.S. Treasury securities 83 98 U.S. agency securities and mortgage-backed securities 354 358 Non-U.S. government securities 15 17 Total Average Global Liquidity Sources $ 565 $ 576 Our GLS are substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the final U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) rules. However, HQLA for purposes of calculating LCR is not reported at market value, but at a lower value that incorporates regulatory deductions and the exclusion 23 Bank of America of excess liquidity held at certain subsidiaries. The LCR is calculated as the amount of a financial institution unencumbered HQLA relative to the estimated net cash outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period of significant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. Our average consolidated HQLA, on a net basis, was $464 billion for both the three months ended March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . For the same periods, the average consolidated LCR was 115 percent and 116 percent . Our LCR fluctuates due to normal business flows from customer activity. Liquidity Stress Analysis We utilize liquidity stress analysis to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our subsidiaries to meet contractual and contingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios. For more information on our liquidity stress analysis, see Liquidity Risk Liquidity Stress Analysis in the MD&A of the Corporation 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Diversified Funding Sources We fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits, and secured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally coordinated funding approach diversified across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups. We fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposits, which were $1.58 trillion and $1.43 trillion at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . Our trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded on a secured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements, and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions. Long-term Debt During the three months ended March 31, 2020 , we issued $18.7 billion of long-term debt consisting of $15.9 billion of notes issued by Bank of America Corporation, substantially all of which was TLAC compliant, $516 million of notes issued by Bank of America, N.A. and $2.3 billion of other debt, substantially all of which was structured liabilities. During the three months ended March 31, 2020 , we had total long-term debt maturities and redemptions in the aggregate of $7.6 billion consisting of $2.1 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $2.6 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $2.9 billion of other debt. Table 15 presents the carrying value of aggregate annual contractual maturities of long-term debt at March 31, 2020 .

The call features give us the flexibility to retire long-term notes before their final year outstanding, when they are no longer eligible to count toward TLAC requirements, and replace them with new TLAC-eligible debt, should we choose to do so. (2) Represents liabilities of consolidated VIEs included in total long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Table 16 presents our long-term debt by major currency at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 .

We may, from time to time, purchase outstanding debt instruments in various transactions, depending on market conditions, liquidity and other factors. Our other regulated entities may also make markets in our debt instruments to provide liquidity for investors. We use derivative transactions to manage the duration, interest rate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering the characteristics of the assets they are funding. For more information on our ALM activities, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 41 . We may issue unsecured debt in the form of structured notes for client purposes, certain of which qualify as TLAC-eligible debt. During three months ended March 31, 2020 , we issued $4.6 billion Bank of America 24 of structured notes, which are debt obligations that pay investors returns linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these liabilities with derivatives and/or investments in the underlying instruments, so that from a funding perspective, the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We could be required to settle certain structured note obligations for cash or other securities prior to maturity under certain circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning purposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date. Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price. For more information on long-term debt funding, including issuances and maturities and redemptions, see Note 12 Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Credit Ratings Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating agencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other securities, including asset securitizations. Table 17 presents the Corporation current long-term/short-term senior debt ratings and outlooks expressed by the rating agencies. On April 22, 2020, Fitch Ratings (Fitch) completed its review of the large, complex securities trading and universal banks in the U.S., including Bank of America, in response to declining economic activity from the COVID-19 pandemic. The agency affirmed the long-term and short-term senior debt ratings of the Corporation and all of its rated subsidiaries, except for select issuer and instrument level ratings that had previously been placed under criteria observation (UCO) on March 4, 2020, following changes in the agency bank rating criteria on February 28, 2020. Concurrently, Fitch reached a conclusion on select UCO designations for the Corporation and upgraded the long-term and short-term senior debt ratings of MLI and BofASE by one notch to AA-/F1+. The agency also upgraded the preferred stock rating of the Corporation by one notch to BBB and downgraded the subordinated debt rating of the Corporation by one notch to A-. According to Fitch, rating changes under UCO are the sole result of bank rating criteria change and do not reflect a change in the underlying fundamentals of the institution. Fitch rating outlook for all our long-term ratings is currently Stable. The ratings from Moody Investors Service (Moody s) and Standard & Poor Global Ratings (S&P) for the Corporation and its subsidiaries did not change from those disclosed in the Corporation's 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information on additional collateral and termination payments that could be required in connection with certain over-the-counter derivative contracts and other trading agreements in the event of a credit rating downgrade, see Note 3 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein and Item 1A.

During the first quarter of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted economic activity in the U.S. and around the world. While we did see increases in Commercial nonperforming loans and reservable criticized exposures, we did not see meaningful impacts to Consumer portfolio delinquencies, nonperforming loans or charge-offs as of and during the three months ended March 31, 2020. To provide relief to individuals and businesses in the U.S., in March and April 2020, the President signed into law four economic stimulus packages, including the CARES Act. U.S. bank regulatory agencies also issued interagency guidance to financial institutions that are working with borrowers affected by COVID-19. To support our customers, we have implemented various loan modification programs and other forms of support, including offering loan payment deferrals, refunding certain fees and pausing foreclosure sales, evictions and repossessions. For a summary of the loan modification programs that we have implemented along with a summary of deferral requests that have been executed, see Executive Summary - Recent Developments COVID-19 Pandemic 2020 on page 3 . For information on the accounting for loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Credit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower credit cycle. Statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio management including underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting credit limits, and establishing operating processes and metrics to 25 Bank of America quantify and balance risks and returns. Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources such as credit bureaus and/or internal historical experience and are a component of our consumer credit risk management process. These models are used in part to assist in making both new and ongoing credit decisions, as well as portfolio management strategies, including authorizations and line management, collection practices and strategies, and determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allocated capital for credit risk. Consumer Credit Portfolio Although COVID-19 is severely impacting economic activity, it did not have a meaningful impact on the consumer portfolio delinquencies, nonperforming loans or charge-offs as of and during the three months ended March 31, 2020 but there may be adverse impacts to credit quality metrics in future periods if negative economic conditions continue. Net charge-offs increased $37 million to $872 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 driven by seasoning in the credit card portfolio. The consumer allowance for loan and lease losses increased $4.5 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2020 to $9.1 billion due to the adoption of the new CECL accounting standard and deterioration in the economic outlook resulting from the impact of COVID-19. For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 38 . For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, charge-offs and TDRs for the consumer portfolio, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 5 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

At March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , residential mortgage includes $637 million and $740 million of loans on which interest had been curtailed by the FHA, and therefore were no longer accruing interest, although principal was still insured, and $314 million and $348 million of loans on which interest was still accruing. (2) Outstandings primarily include auto and specialty lending loans and leases of $50.0 billion and $50.4 billion , U.S. securities-based lending loans of $36.4 billion and $36.7 billion and non-U.S. consumer loans of $3.0 billion and $2.8 billion at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . (3) Consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option include residential mortgage loans of $231 million and $257 million and home equity loans of $325 million and $337 million at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . For more information on the fair value option, see Note 15 Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements . (4) Excludes consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option. At both March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , $6 million of loans accounted for under the fair value option were past due 90 days or more and not accruing interest. n/a = not applicable Table 19 presents net charge-offs and related ratios for consumer loans and leases.

We categorize consumer real estate loans as core and non-core based on loan and customer characteristics such as origination date, product type, loan-to-value (LTV), Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score and delinquency status consistent with our current consumer and mortgage servicing Bank of America 26 strategy. Generally, loans that were originated after January 1, 2010, qualified under government-sponsored enterprise underwriting guidelines, or otherwise met our underwriting guidelines in place in 2015 are characterized as core loans. All other loans are generally characterized as non-core loans and represent runoff portfolios. Core loans as reported in Table 20 include loans held in the Consumer Banking and GWIM segments, as well as loans held for ALM activities in All Other . As shown in Table 20 , outstanding core consumer real estate loans increased $7.5 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2020 driven by an increase of $7.9 billion in residential mortgage, partially offset by a $353 million decrease in home equity.

Consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option include residential mortgage loans of $231 million and $257 million and home equity loans of $325 million and $337 million at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . For more information, see Note 15 Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements . (2) The home equity non-core allowance is in a negative position at March 31, 2020 as it includes expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off. (3) Home equity allowance includes a reserve for unfunded lending commitments of $149 million at March 31, 2020 . We believe that the presentation of information adjusted to exclude the impact of the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option is more representative of the ongoing operations and credit quality of the business. As a result, in the following tables and discussions of the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios, we exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option and provide information that excludes the impact of the fully-insured loan portfolio in certain credit quality statistics. Residential Mortgage The residential mortgage portfolio made up the largest percentage of our consumer loan portfolio at 52 percent of consumer loans and leases at March 31, 2020 . Approximately 51 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio was in Consumer Banking and 36 percent was in GWIM. The remaining portion was in All Other and was comprised of loans used in our overall ALM activities, delinquent FHA loans repurchased pursuant to our servicing agreements with the Government National Mortgage Association as well as loans repurchased related to our representations and warranties. Outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio increased $7.4 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2020 as retention of new originations was partially offset by runoff. At March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , the residential mortgage portfolio included $18.8 billion and $18.7 billion of outstanding fully-insured loans, of which $10.9 billion and $11.2 billion had FHA insurance with the remainder protected by long-term standby agreements. Table 21 presents certain residential mortgage key credit statistics on both a reported basis and excluding the fully-insured loan portfolio. The following discussion presents the residential mortgage portfolio excluding the fully-insured loan portfolio. 27 Bank of America Table 21 Residential Mortgage Key Credit Statistics Reported Basis (1) Excluding Fully-insured Loans (1) (Dollars in millions) March 31 2020 December 31 2019 March 31 2020 December 31 2019 Outstandings $ 243,545 $ 236,169 $ 224,720 $ 217,479 Accruing past due 30 days or more 2,937 3,108 1,338 1,296 Accruing past due 90 days or more 951 1,088 Nonperforming loans 1,580 1,470 1,580 1,470 Percent of portfolio Refreshed LTV greater than 90 but less than or equal to 100 2 % 2 % 2 % 2 % Refreshed LTV greater than 100 1 1 1 1 Refreshed FICO below 620 2 3 1 2 2006 and 2007 vintages (2) 3 4 3 4 (1) Outstandings, accruing past due, nonperforming loans and percentages of portfolio exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. For information on our interest accrual policies and delinquency status for loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements . (2) These vintages of loans accounted for $440 million , or 28 percent , and $365 million , or 25 percent , of nonperforming residential mortgage loans at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . Nonperforming outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio increased $110 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020 primarily driven by the inclusion of certain loans that were previously classified as purchased credit-impaired loans and accounted for under a pool basis. Upon adoption of the new credit loss standard, these loans are accounted for on an individual basis and, if applicable, included in nonperforming loans. Of the nonperforming residential mortgage loans at March 31, 2020 , $612 million , or 39 percent , were current on contractual payments. Loans accruing past due 30 days or more increased $42 million . Net charge-offs increased $15 million to a net recovery of $1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to a net recovery of $16 million for the same period in 2019 , as the prior-year period included recoveries on sales of previously charged-off loans. Of the $224.7 billion in total residential mortgage loans outstanding at March 31, 2020 , as shown in Table 21 , 26 percent were originated as interest-only loans. The outstanding balance of interest-only residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period was $7.0 billion , or 12 percent , at March 31, 2020 . Residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period generally have experienced a higher rate of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status compared to the residential mortgage portfolio as a whole. At March 31, 2020 , $125 million , or two percent of outstanding interest-only residential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $1.3 billion , or one percent , for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, at March 31, 2020 , $287 million , or four percent , of outstanding interest-only residential mortgage loans that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming, of which $115 million were contractually current, compared to $1.6 billion , or one percent , for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. Loans that have yet to enter the amortization period in our interest-only residential mortgage portfolio are primarily well-collateralized loans to our wealth management clients and have an interest-only period of three to ten years. Approximately 95 percent of these loans that have yet to enter the amortization period will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2022 or later. Table 22 presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the residential mortgage portfolio. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) within California represented 16 percent of outstandings at both March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 13 percent of outstandings at both March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 .

Home Equity At March 31, 2020 , the home equity portfolio made up nine percent of the consumer portfolio and was comprised of home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), home equity loans and reverse mortgages. We no longer originate home equity loans or reverse mortgages. At March 31, 2020 , our HELOC portfolio had an outstanding balance of $37.0 billion , or 94 percent of the total home equity portfolio, compared to $37.5 billion , or 93 percent , at December 31, 2019 . HELOCs generally have an initial draw period of 10 years, and after the initial draw period ends, the loans generally convert to 15- or 20-year amortizing loans. At both March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , our home equity loan portfolio had an outstanding balance of $1.2 billion , or three percent of the total home equity portfolio. At March 31, 2020 , our reverse mortgage portfolio had an outstanding balance Bank of America 28 of $1.4 billion , or three percent of the total home equity portfolio, compared to $1.5 billion , or four percent , at December 31, 2019 . At March 31, 2020 , 80 percent of the home equity portfolio was in Consumer Banking , 12 percent was in All Other and the remainder of the portfolio was primarily in GWIM . Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased $641 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020 primarily due to paydowns outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines. Of the total home equity portfolio at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , $14.8 billion , or 37 percent , and $15.0 billion , or 37 percent , were in first-lien positions. At March 31, 2020 , outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio that were in a second-lien or more junior-lien position and where we also held the first-lien loan totaled $6.9 billion , or 17 percent of our total home equity portfolio. Unused HELOCs totaled $43.7 billion and $43.6 billion at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . The increase was primarily driven by new production partially offset by customers choosing to close accounts. The HELOC utilization rate was 46 percent at both March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . Table 23 presents certain home equity portfolio key credit statistics. Table 23 Home Equity Key Credit Statistics (1) (Dollars in millions) March 31 2020 December 31 2019 Outstandings $ 39,567 $ 40,208 Accruing past due 30 days or more (2) 205 218 Nonperforming loans (2) 578 536 Percent of portfolio Refreshed CLTV greater than 90 but less than or equal to 100 1 % 1 % Refreshed CLTV greater than 100 2 2 Refreshed FICO below 620 3 3 2006 and 2007 vintages (3) 17 18 (1) Outstandings, accruing past due, nonperforming loans and percentages of the portfolio exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. For information on our interest accrual policies and delinquency status for loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements . (2) Accruing past due 30 days or more include $29 million and $30 million and nonperforming loans include $59 million and $57 million of loans where we serviced the underlying first lien at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . (3) These vintages of loans accounted for 35 percent and 34 percent of nonperforming home equity loans at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . Nonperforming outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio increased $42 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020 primarily driven by the inclusion of certain loans that were previously classified as purchased credit-impaired loans and accounted for under a pool basis. Upon adoption of the new credit loss standard, these loans are accounted for on an individual basis and, if applicable, included in nonperforming loans. Of the nonperforming home equity loans at March 31, 2020 , $266 million , or 46 percent , were current on contractual payments. Nonperforming loans that are contractually current primarily consist of collateral-dependent TDRs, including those that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, junior-lien loans where the underlying first lien is 90 days or more past due, as well as loans that have not yet demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance following a TDR. In addition, $173 million , or 30 percent of nonperforming home equity loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell. Accruing loans that were 30 days or more past due decreased $13 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020 . Net charge-offs decreased $22 million to a net recovery of $11 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to net charge-offs of $11 million for the same period in 2019 , as the prior-year period included charge-offs from home equity loan sales. Of the $39.6 billion in total home equity portfolio outstandings at March 31, 2020 , as shown in Table 23 , 16 percent require interest-only payments. The outstanding balance of HELOCs that have reached the end of their draw period and have entered the amortization period was $11.0 billion at March 31, 2020 . The HELOCs that have entered the amortization period have experienced a higher percentage of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status when compared to the HELOC portfolio as a whole. At March 31, 2020 , $144 million , or one percent of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more. In addition, at March 31, 2020 , $406 million , or four percent , were nonperforming. Loans that have yet to enter the amortization period in our interest-only portfolio are primarily post-2008 vintages and generally have better credit quality than the previous vintages that had entered the amortization period. We communicate to contractually current customers more than a year prior to the end of their draw period to inform them of the potential change to the payment structure before entering the amortization period, and provide payment options to customers prior to the end of the draw period. Although we do not actively track how many of our home equity customers pay only the minimum amount due on their home equity loans and lines, we can infer some of this information through a review of our HELOC portfolio that we service and that is still in its revolving period. During the three months ended March 31, 2020 , 21 percent of these customers with an outstanding balance did not pay any principal on their HELOCs. Table 24 presents outstandings, nonperforming balances and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the home equity portfolio. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 13 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California made up 11 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . 29 Bank of America Table 24 Home Equity State Concentrations Outstandings (1) Nonperforming (1) Net Charge-offs March 31 December 31 March 31 December 31 Three Months Ended March 31 (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 California $ 11,106 $ 11,232 $ 116 $ 101 $ (5 ) $ (5 ) Florida 4,241 4,327 75 71 (3 ) (3 ) New Jersey 3,145 3,216 60 56 5 New York 2,819 2,899 88 85 1 10 Massachusetts 1,979 2,023 31 29 1 Other 16,277 16,511 208 194 (5 ) 4 Total home equity loan portfolio $ 39,567 $ 40,208 $ 578 $ 536 $ (11 ) $ 11 (1) Outstandings and nonperforming loans exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. Credit Card At March 31, 2020 , 97 percent of the credit card portfolio was managed in Consumer Banking with the remainder in GWIM . Outstandings in the credit card portfolio decreased $5.7 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2020 to $91.9 billion due to a seasonal decline in purchase volumes. Net charge-offs increased $25 million to $770 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to $745 million for the same period in 2019 due to portfolio seasoning. Credit card loans 30 days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased $135 million and loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased $51 million due to seasonal declines. Unused lines of credit for credit card increased to $345.0 billion at March 31, 2020 from $336.9 billion at December 31, 2019 driven by seasonally lower purchase volumes.

Direct/Indirect Consumer At March 31, 2020 , 56 percent of the direct/indirect portfolio was included in Consumer Banking (consumer auto and specialty lending automotive, recreational vehicle, marine, aircraft and consumer personal loans) and 44 percent was included in GWIM (principally securities-based lending loans). Outstandings of $90.2 billion in the direct/indirect portfolio were relatively unchanged at March 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019.

Bank of America 30 Nonperforming Consumer Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity Table 27 presents nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 . During the three months ended March 31, 2020 , nonperforming consumer loans increased $151 million to $2.2 billion primarily driven by the inclusion of $150 million of certain loans that were previously classified as purchased credit-impaired loans and accounted for under a pool basis. At March 31, 2020 , $673 million , or 31 percent of nonperforming loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to their estimated property value less costs to sell. In addition, at March 31, 2020 , $921 million , or 42 percent of nonperforming consumer loans were modified and are now current after successful trial periods, or are current loans classified as nonperforming loans in accordance with applicable policies. Foreclosed properties decreased $3 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020 to $226 million as liquidations outpaced additions. Nonperforming loans also include certain loans that have been modified in TDRs where economic concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. Nonperforming TDRs are included in Table 27 . For more information on our loan modification programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which are not TDRs, see Executive Summary - Recent Developments COVID-19 Pandemic 2020 on page 3 and Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements .

(2) At March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , residential mortgage performing TDRs include $2.0 billion and $2.1 billion of loans that were fully-insured. (3) At March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , home equity TDRs deemed collateral dependent totaled $427 million and $442 million , and include $207 million and $209 million of loans classified as nonperforming and $220 million and $233 million of loans classified as performing. In addition to modifying consumer real estate loans, we work with customers who are experiencing financial difficulty by modifying credit card and other consumer loans. Credit card and other consumer loan modifications generally involve a reduction in the customer interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months, all of which are considered TDRs (the renegotiated TDR portfolio). Modifications of credit card and other consumer loans are made through renegotiation programs utilizing direct customer contact, but may also utilize external renegotiation programs. The renegotiated TDR portfolio is excluded in large part from Table 27 as substantially all of the loans remain on accrual status until either charged off or paid in full. At March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , our renegotiated TDR portfolio was $694 million and $679 million , of which $590 million and $570 million were current or less than 30 days past due under the modified terms. The increase in the renegotiated TDR portfolio was primarily driven by new renegotiated enrollments outpacing runoff of existing portfolios. Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Commercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal that concentrations of credit exposure continue to be aligned with our risk appetite. We review, measure and manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, customer relationship and loan size. We also review, measure and manage 31 Bank of America commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property type. In addition, within our non-U.S. portfolio, we evaluate exposures by region and by country. Tables 33 , 36 and 39 summarize our concentrations. We also utilize syndications of exposure to third parties, loan sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio. For more information on our industry concentrations, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Industry Concentrations on page 35 and Table 36 . For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, net charge-offs and TDRs for the commercial portfolio, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . For information on the accounting for loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Commercial Credit Portfolio During the three months ended March 31, 2020 , commercial asset quality weakened as a result of the economic impact from COVID-19. Large corporate and commercial clients drew down on their existing lines of credit which contributed to a $67.2 billion increase in commercial loans for the three months ended March 31, 2020 . These draws were well diversified across industries and approximately 90 percent were investment grade or collateralized. Credit quality of commercial real estate borrowers in most sectors remained stable but also began to experience varying degrees of strain as a result of COVID-19. Many real estate markets experienced disruption in demand, supply chain challenges and underlying tenant difficulties. The commercial allowance for loan and lease losses increased $1.8 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2020 to $6.7 billion due to the deterioration in the economic outlook resulting from the impact of COVID-19. For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 38 . Total commercial utilized credit exposure increased $84.6 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2020 to $719.9 billion driven by higher loans and leases. The utilization rate for loans and leases, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and financial guarantees, and commercial letters of credit, in the aggregate, was 64 percent at March 31, 2020 and 58 percent at December 31, 2019 . Table 29 presents commercial credit exposure by type for utilized, unfunded and total binding committed credit exposure. Commercial utilized credit exposure includes SBLCs and financial guarantees and commercial letters of credit that have been issued and for which we are legally bound to advance funds under prescribed conditions during a specified time period, and excludes exposure related to trading account assets. Although funds have not yet been advanced, these exposure types are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes.

(4) Includes the notional amount of unfunded legally binding lending commitments net of amounts distributed (i.e., syndicated or participated) to other financial institutions. The distributed amounts were $10.5 billion and $10.6 billion at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . (5) Derivative assets are carried at fair value, reflect the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and have been reduced by cash collateral of $53.4 billion and $33.9 billion at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . Not reflected in utilized and committed exposure is additional non-cash derivative collateral held of $ 35.7 billion and $35.2 billion at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , which consists primarily of other marketable securities. Outstanding commercial loans and leases increased $67.2 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2020 primarily in the commercial and industrial portfolio. Nonperforming commercial loans increased $353 million and commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure increased $ 5.9 billion driven primarily by the impact of COVID-19 and was broad-based across industries.

Table 32 presents commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure by loan type. Criticized exposure corresponds to the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful asset categories as defined by regulatory authorities. Total commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure increased $5.9 billion , or 52 percent , during the three months ended March 31, 2020 driven by the impact of COVID-19 with increases spread across multiple industries including the energy sector, which was also impacted by the weakness in oil prices and oil price volatility in the quarter. At March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , 89 percent and 90 percent of commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure was secured.

(2) Percentages are calculated as commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure divided by total commercial reservable utilized exposure for each exposure category. Commercial and Industrial Commercial and industrial loans include U.S. commercial and non-U.S. commercial portfolios. U.S. Commercial At March 31, 2020 , 72 percent of the U.S. commercial loan portfolio, excluding small business, was managed in Global 33 Bank of America Banking, 15 percent in Global Markets , 12 percent in GWIM (generally business-purpose loans for high net worth clients) and the remainder primarily in Consumer Banking . U.S. commercial loans increased $51.5 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2020 across all lines of business. Reservable criticized utilized exposure increased $4.9 billion , or 59 percent , driven by the impact of COVID-19 and was broad-based across industries. Non-U.S. Commercial At March 31, 2020 , 83 percent of the non-U.S. commercial loan portfolio was managed in Global Banking and 17 percent in Global Markets . Non-U.S. commercial loans increased $11.6 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2020 , primarily in Global Banking . For information on the non-U.S. commercial portfolio, see Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 37 . Commercial Real Estate Commercial real estate primarily includes commercial loans secured by non-owner-occupied real estate and is dependent on the sale or lease of the real estate as the primary source of repayment. Outstanding loans increased $4.0 billion , or six percent , during the three months ended March 31, 2020 to $66.7 billion due to new originations and increased utilizations under existing credit facilities outpacing paydowns. The portfolio remains diversified across property types and geographic regions. California represented the largest state concentration at 23 percent and 24 percent of the commercial real estate portfolio at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . The commercial real estate portfolio is predominantly managed in Global Banking and consists of loans made primarily to public and private developers, and commercial real estate firms. For the three months ended March 31, 2020 , we continued to see low default rates and solid credit quality although we began to see some developing weakness in the non-residential portfolio toward the end of the quarter. We use a number of proactive risk mitigation initiatives to reduce adversely rated exposure in the commercial real estate portfolio, including transfers of deteriorating exposures to management by independent special asset officers and the pursuit of loan restructurings or asset sales to achieve the best results for our customers and the Corporation.

U.S. Small Business Commercial The U.S. small business commercial loan portfolio is comprised of small business card loans and small business loans managed in Consumer Banking . Credit card-related products were 52 percent of the U.S. small business commercial portfolio at both March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . Of the U.S. small business commercial net charge-offs, 90 percent and 95 percent were credit card-related products for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 . Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity Table 34 presents the nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity during the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 . Nonperforming loans do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. During the three months ended March 31, 2020 , nonperforming commercial loans and leases increased $353 million to $1.9 billion , driven primarily by the impact of COVID-19. At March 31, 2020 , 92 percent of commercial nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties were secured and 63 percent were contractually current. Commercial nonperforming loans were carried at 86 percent of their unpaid principal balance before consideration of the allowance for loan and lease losses as the carrying value of these loans has been reduced to the estimated collateral value less costs to sell.

TDRs are generally classified as performing after a sustained period of demonstrated payment performance. (4) Outstanding commercial loans exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. Table 35 presents our commercial TDRs by product type and performing status. U.S. small business commercial TDRs are comprised of renegotiated small business card loans and small business loans. The renegotiated small business card loans are not classified as nonperforming as they are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due.

Our commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. Total commercial committed exposure increased $18.4 billion , or two percent, during the three months ended March 31, 2020 to $1.1 trillion . The increase in commercial committed exposure was concentrated in the Financial markets infrastructure, Capital goods, and Transportation industry sectors. Increases were partially offset by decreased exposure to the Utilities, Consumer services, and Commercial services and supplies industry sectors. For information on industry limits, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management - Industry Concentrations in the MD&A of the Corporation 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Asset managers and funds, our largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $109.3 billion , decreased $693 million , or one percent , during the three months ended March 31, 2020 . Real estate, our second largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $95.5 billion , decreased $875 million , or one percent , during the three months ended March 31, 2020 . For more information on the commercial real estate and related portfolios, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Commercial Real Estate on page 34 . Capital goods, our third largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $85.5 billion , increased $4.7 billion , or six percent , during the three months ended March 31, 2020 with the growth largely occurring in the aerospace and defense, and machinery and industrial conglomerates categories, partially offset by a decrease in building products. Given the widespread impact the COVID-19 pandemic is having on the U.S. and global economy, a number of industries have been or will be adversely impacted. We continue to monitor all industries, particularly higher risk industries, that are experiencing or are expected to experience a more significant impact to their financial condition. In addition, we continue to assess potential mitigants such as the various stimulus programs designed to support these clients and industries through the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has also placed significant stress on global demand for oil, resulting in a steep decline in prices. Our energy-related committed exposure increased $1.7 billion , or five percent , during the three months ended March 31, 2020 to $38.0 35 Bank of America billion , driven by our integrated client exposure, partially offset by a decline in our higher risk exploration and production exposure.

(4) Represents net notional credit protection purchased to hedge funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures. For more information, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Risk Mitigation . Risk Mitigation We purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. To lower the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, we may add credit exposure within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. At March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, was $6.5 billion and $3.3 billion . We recorded net gains on these positions of $229 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to net losses of $65 million for the same period in 2019 . The gains and losses on these instruments were offset by gains and losses on the related exposures. The Value-at-Risk (VaR) results for these exposures are included in the fair value option portfolio information in Table 42 . For more information, see Trading Risk Management on page 40 .

Non-U.S. Portfolio Our non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios are subject to country risk. We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in government policies. A risk management framework is in place to measure, monitor and manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. In addition to the direct risk of doing business in a country, we also are exposed to indirect country risks (e.g., related to the collateral received on secured financing transactions or related to client clearing activities). These indirect exposures are managed in the normal course of business through credit, market and operational risk governance, rather than through country risk governance. Table 39 presents our 20 largest non-U.S. country exposures at March 31, 2020 . These exposures accounted for 90 percent and 88 percent of our total non-U.S. exposure at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . Net country exposure for these 20 countries increased $43.9 billion in the three months ended March 31, 2020 , primarily driven by increased sovereign and corporate exposure across multiple countries. The majority of the increase was due to higher deposits with non-U.S. central banks and increased counterparty exposure.

Our largest non-U.S. country exposure at March 31, 2020 was the U.K. with net exposure of $61.8 billion , which represents a $6.0 billion increase from December 31, 2019 . Our second largest non-U.S. country exposure was Germany with net exposure of $44.9 billion at March 31, 2020 , a $14.1 billion increase from December 31, 2019 . The increase in Germany was primarily driven by an increase in sovereign exposure. In light of the COVID-19 global pandemic, we are monitoring our non-U.S. exposure closely, particularly in countries where restrictions on certain activities, in an attempt to contain the spread and impact of the virus, have affected and will continue to adversely affect economic activity. We are managing the impact to our international business operations as part of our overall response framework and are taking actions to manage exposure carefully in impacted regions while supporting the needs of our clients. The magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its full impact on the global economy is highly uncertain. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could have an adverse impact on the global economy for a prolonged period of time. For more information on how the COVID-19 pandemic may affect our operations, see Executive Summary - Recent Developments COVID-19 Pandemic 2020 on page 3 and Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors on page 96 . 37 Bank of America Allowance for Credit Losses On January 1, 2020 , the Corporation adopted the new accounting standard that requires the measurement of the allowance for credit losses to be based on management best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the Corporation relevant financial assets. Upon adoption of the new accounting standard, the Corporation recorded a net increase of $3.3 billion in the allowance for credit losses on January 1, 2020 which was comprised of a net increase of $2.9 billion in the allowance for loan and lease losses and an increase of $310 million in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The net increase was primarily driven by a $3.1 billion increase related to the credit card portfolio. The allowance for credit losses further increased by $3.6 billion at March 31, 2020 , which included a $2.2 billion increase in the commercial portfolio and a $774 million increase in the credit card portfolio. The increases were primarily due to the deterioration in the economic outlook resulting from the impact of COVID-19. The following table presents an allocation of the allowance for credit losses by product type for March 31, 2020 , January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2019 (prior to the adoption of the CECL accounting standard).

Consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option include residential mortgage loans of $231 million at March 31, 2020 and $257 million at January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2019 and home equity loans of $325 million at March 31, 2020 and $337 million at January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . Commercial loans accounted for under the fair value option include U.S. commercial loans of $5.1 billion at March 31, 2020 and January 1, 2020 and $4.7 billion at December 31, 2019 and non-U.S. commercial loans of $3.4 billion , $3.2 billion and $3.1 billion at March 31, 2020 , January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively. (2) Includes allowance for loan and lease losses for U.S. small business commercial loans of $1.1 billion , $831 million and $523 million at March 31, 2020 , January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . n/m = not meaningful Net charge-offs for the three months ended March 31, 2020 were $1.1 billion compared to $991 million for the same period in 2019 driven by increases in commercial losses. The provision for credit losses for the three months ended March 31, 2020 was $4.8 billion which was $3.7 billion higher than the same period in 2019 . The provision for credit losses was $3.6 billion higher than net charge-offs for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , which was primarily due to the deterioration in the economic outlook resulting from the impact of COVID-19 on both the consumer and commercial portfolios. The provision for credit losses for the consumer portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, increased $1.3 billion to $2.1 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 . The provision for credit losses for the commercial portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, increased $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 . The following table presents a rollforward of the allowance for credit losses, including certain loan and allowance ratios for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 , noting that measurement of the allowance for credit losses for 2019 was based on management estimate of probable incurred losses.

Market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions may adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities, or otherwise negatively impact earnings. This risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations, primarily within our Global Markets segment. We are also exposed to these risks in other areas of the Corporation (e.g., our ALM activities). In the event of market stress, these risks could have a material impact on our results. We have been affected, and expect to continue to be affected, by market stress resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic that began in the first quarter of 2020. For more information on the effects of the pandemic, see Executive Summary - Recent Developments COVID-19 Pandemic 2020 on page 3 . Trading Risk Management To evaluate risks in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of revenues generated by individual positions as well as portfolios of positions. VaR is a common statistic used to measure market risk. Our primary VaR statistic is equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level, which means that for a VaR with a one-day holding period, there should not be losses in excess of VaR, on average, 99 out of 100 trading days. Table 42 presents the total market-based portfolio VaR which is the combination of the total covered positions (and less liquid trading positions) portfolio and the fair value option portfolio. For more information on the market risk VaR for trading activities, see Trading Risk Management in the MD&A of the Corporation 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . The total market-based portfolio VaR results in Table 42 include market risk to which we are exposed from all business segments, excluding credit valuation adjustment (CVA), DVA and related hedges. The majority of this portfolio is within the Global Markets segment. Table 42 presents year-end, average, high and low daily trading VaR for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019 using a 99 percent confidence level. The amounts disclosed in Table 42 and Table 43 align to the view of covered positions used in the Basel 3 capital calculations. Foreign exchange and commodity positions are always considered covered positions, regardless of trading or banking treatment for the trade, except for structural foreign currency positions that are excluded with prior regulatory approval. The average of total covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio VaR increased for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the previous quarter primarily due to increased market volatility in March as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which heightened VaR for equity and credit risk factors.

Therefore the impact from less liquid exposures and the amount of portfolio diversification, which is the difference between the total portfolio and the sum of the individual components, is not relevant. The graph below presents the daily covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio VaR for the previous five quarters, corresponding to the data in Table 42 . Peak VaR in mid-March was driven by increased market realized volatility and higher implied volatilities. Bank of America 40 Additional VaR statistics produced within our single VaR model are provided in Table 43 at the same level of detail as in Table 42 . Evaluating VaR with additional statistics allows for an increased understanding of the risks in the portfolio as the historical market data used in the VaR calculation does not necessarily follow a predefined statistical distribution. Table 43 presents average trading VaR statistics at 99 percent and 95 percent confidence levels for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019 .

For more information on our backtesting process, see Trading Risk Management Backtesting in the MD&A of the Corporation 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . During the three months ended March 31, 2020 , there were seven days where this subset of trading revenue had losses that exceeded our total covered portfolio VaR, utilizing a one-day holding period. Total Trading-related Revenue Total trading-related revenue, excluding brokerage fees, and CVA, DVA and funding valuation adjustment gains (losses), represents the total amount earned from trading positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. For more information, see Trading Risk Management Total Trading-related Revenue in the MD&A of the Corporation 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . The following histogram is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2019 . During the three months ended March 31, 2020 , positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 94 percent of the trading days, of which 89 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million, and the largest loss was $90 million. This compares to the three months ended December 31, 2019 where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 98 percent of the trading days, of which 73 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million, and the largest loss was $4 million. Trading Portfolio Stress Testing Because the very nature of a VaR model suggests results can exceed our estimates and it is dependent on a limited historical window, we also stress test our portfolio using scenario analysis. This analysis estimates the change in the value of our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements.

Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book The following discussion presents net interest income for banking book activities. For more information, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book in the MD&A of the Corporation 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Table 44 presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . 41 Bank of America Table 44 Forward Rates March 31, 2020 Federal Funds Three-month LIBOR 10-Year Swap Spot rates 0.25 % 1.45 % 0.72 % 12-month forward rates 0.25 0.28 0.76 December 31, 2019 Spot rates 1.75 % 1.91 % 1.90 % 12-month forward rates 1.50 1.62 1.92 Table 45 shows the pretax impact to forecasted net interest income over the next 12 months from March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 resulting from instantaneous parallel and non-parallel shocks to the market-based forward curve. Periodically we evaluate the scenarios presented so that they are meaningful in the context of the current rate environment. The interest rate scenarios also assume U.S. dollar rates are floored at zero. In the three months ended March 31, 2020 , the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet increased primarily due to decreases in interest rates. We continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel move in interest rates with the majority of that impact coming from the short end of the yield curve. Additionally, higher interest rates impact the fair value of debt securities and, accordingly, for debt securities classified as AFS, may adversely affect OCI and thus capital levels under the Basel 3 capital rules. Under instantaneous upward parallel shifts, the near-term adverse impact to Basel 3 capital is reduced over time by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income. For more information on Basel 3, see Capital Management Regulatory Capital on page 19 . Table 45 Estimated Banking Book Net Interest Income Sensitivity to Curve Changes Short Rate (bps) Long Rate (bps) (Dollars in millions) March 31 2020 December 31 2019 Parallel Shifts +100 bps instantaneous shift +100 +100 $ 7,205 $ 4,190 -25 bps instantaneous shift -25 -25 (2,285 ) (1,500 ) Flatteners Short-end instantaneous change +100 4,533 2,641 Long-end instantaneous change -25 (864 ) (653 ) Steepeners Short-end instantaneous change -25 (1,418 ) (844 ) Long-end instantaneous change +100 2,701 1,561 The sensitivity analysis in Table 45 assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates. As part of our ALM activities, we use securities, certain residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity. The behavior of our deposits portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income. The sensitivity analysis in Table 45 assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce our benefit in those scenarios. Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative Contracts Interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts are utilized in our ALM activities and serve as an efficient tool to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk. We use derivatives to hedge the variability in cash flows or changes in fair value on our balance sheet due to interest rate and foreign exchange components. For more information on our hedging activities, see Note 3 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . For more information on interest rate contracts and risk management, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book in the MD&A of the Corporation 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . We use interest rate derivative instruments to hedge the variability in the cash flows of our assets and liabilities and other forecasted transactions (collectively referred to as cash flow hedges). The net results on both open and terminated cash flow hedge derivative instruments recorded in accumulated OCI were a gain of $39 million and a loss of $496 million , on a pretax basis, at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . These gains (losses) are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the same period as the hedged cash flows affect earnings and will decrease income or increase expense on the respective hedged cash flows. Assuming no change in open cash flow derivative hedge positions and no changes in prices or interest rates beyond what is implied in forward yield curves at March 31, 2020 , the after-tax net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings as follows: a gain of $77 million within the next year, a gain of $104 million in years two through five, a loss of $100 million in years six through ten, with the remaining loss of $64 million thereafter. For more information on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, see Note 3 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . We hedge our net investment in non-U.S. operations determined to have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar using forward foreign exchange contracts that typically settle in less than 180 days, cross-currency basis swaps and foreign exchange options. We recorded net after-tax losses on derivatives in accumulated OCI associated with net investment hedges which were offset by gains on our net investments in consolidated non-U.S. entities at March 31, 2020 . Table 46 presents derivatives utilized in our ALM activities and shows the notional amount, fair value, weighted-average receive-fixed and pay-fixed rates, expected maturity and average estimated durations of our open ALM derivatives at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . These amounts do not include derivative hedges on our MSRs. During the three months ended March 31, 2020 , the fair value of receive-fixed interest rate swaps increased while pay-fixed interest swaps decreased, primarily driven by lower swap rates on hedges of U.S. dollar long-term debt.

We determine whether loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate. Changes in interest rates impact the value of interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and the related residential first mortgage loans held-for-sale (LHFS), as well as the value of the MSRs. Because the interest rate risks of these hedged items offset, we combine them into one overall hedged item with one combined economic hedge portfolio consisting of derivative contracts and securities. For more information on IRLCs and the related residential mortgage LHFS, see Mortgage Banking Risk Management in the MD&A of the Corporation 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . During the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 , we recorded gains of $163 million and $61 million related to the change in fair value of the MSRs, IRLCs and LHFS, net of gains and losses on the hedge portfolio. Complex Accounting Estimates Our significant accounting principles are essential in understanding the MD&A. Many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments. For more information, see Complex Accounting Estimates in the MD&A of the Corporation 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as noted below under Allowance for Credit Losses, there have not been any material updates to our complex accounting estimates as disclosed in the MD&A of the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K. Allowance for Credit Losses On January 1, 2020 , the Corporation adopted the new accounting standard that requires the measurement of the allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, to be based on management best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the Corporation's relevant financial assets. The Corporation's estimate of lifetime expected credit losses includes the use of quantitative models that incorporate forward- looking macroeconomic scenarios that are applied over the contractual life of the loan portfolios, adjusted for expected prepayments and borrower controlled extension options. These macroeconomic scenarios include variables that have historically been key drivers of increases and decreases in credit losses. These variables include, but are not limited to, unemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product levels, corporate bond spreads and long-term interest rate forecasts. As any one economic outlook is inherently uncertain, the Corporation leverages multiple scenarios. The scenarios that are chosen each quarter and the amount of weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events, leading economic indicators, views of internal as well as third-party economists and industry trends. The Corporation also includes qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but, in the Corporation's assessment, may not be adequately represented in the economic assumptions described above. For example, factors that the Corporation considers include changes in lending policies and procedures, business conditions, the nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such as competition, and legal and regulatory requirements, among others. Further, the Corporation considers the inherent uncertainty in quantitative models that are built on historical data. The allowance for credit losses can also be impacted by unanticipated changes in asset quality of the portfolio, such as increases in risk rating downgrades in our commercial portfolio, deterioration in borrower delinquencies or credit scores in our credit card portfolio or increases in LTVs in our consumer real estate portfolio. In addition, while we have incorporated our estimated impact of COVID-19 into our allowance for credit losses, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 is still unknown, including how long economic activities will be impacted and what effect the unprecedented levels of government fiscal and monetary actions will have on the economy and our credit losses. As described above, the process to determine the allowance for credit losses requires numerous estimates and assumptions, some of which require a high degree of judgment and are often interrelated. Changes in the estimates and assumptions can result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses. Our process for determining the allowance for credit losses is further discussed in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 5 Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements .
