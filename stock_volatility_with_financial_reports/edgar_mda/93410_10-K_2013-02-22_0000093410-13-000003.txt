     Refer to the “Results of Operations” section beginning on page FS-6 for a discussion of financial results by major operating area for the three years ended December 31, 2012. 

Business Environment and Outlook 
Chevron is a global energy company with substantial business activities in the following countries: Angola, Argentina, Australia, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Brazil, Cambodia, Canada, Chad, China, Colombia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Denmark, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Myanmar, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Norway, the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, the Philippines, Republic of the Congo, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, the United Kingdom, the United States, Venezuela, and Vietnam.
     Earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream and downstream business segments. The biggest factor affecting the results of operations for the company is the level of the price of crude oil. In the downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products. Seasonality is not a primary driver of changes in the company’s quarterly 
 
earnings during the year. 
     To sustain its long-term competitive position in the upstream business, the company must develop and replenish an inventory of projects that offer attractive financial returns for the investment required. Identifying promising areas for exploration, acquiring the necessary rights to explore for and to produce crude oil and natural gas, drilling successfully, and handling the many technical and operational details in a safe and cost-effective manner are all important factors in this effort. Projects often require long lead times and large capital commitments.
     The company’s operations, especially upstream, can also be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates, including the United States. From time to time, certain governments have sought to renegotiate contracts or impose additional costs on the company. Governments may attempt to do so in the future. Civil unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may impact the company’s operations or investments. Those developments have at times significantly affected the company’s operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries.
     The company continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not expected to provide sufficient long-term value or to acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset base to help augment the company’s financial performance and growth. Refer to the “Results of Operations” section beginning on page FS-6 for discussions of net gains on asset sales during 2012. Asset dispositions and restructurings may also occur in future periods and could result in significant gains or losses.
     The company closely monitors developments in the financial and credit markets, the level of worldwide economic activity, and the implications for the company of movements in prices for crude oil and natural gas. Management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planning.
     Comments related to earnings trends for the company’s major business areas are as follows:
     
     Upstream Earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry price levels for crude oil and natural gas. Crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over which the company has no control, including product demand connected with global economic conditions, industry inventory levels, production quotas imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest or political uncertainty. Any of these factors could 








FS-2



also inhibit the company’s production capacity in an affected region. The company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments, and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses. The longer-term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors, including the company’s ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas, changes in fiscal terms of contracts, and changes in tax laws and regulations. 
     The company continues to actively manage its schedule of work, contracting, procurement and supply-chain activities to effectively manage costs. However, price levels for capital and exploratory costs and operating expenses associated with the production of crude oil and natural gas can be subject to external factors beyond the company’s control. External factors include not only the general level of inflation, but also commodity prices and prices charged by the industry’s material and service providers, which can be affected by the volatility of the industry’s own supply-and-demand conditions for such materials and services. Capital and exploratory expenditures and operating expenses can also be affected by damage to production facilities caused by severe weather or civil unrest.

     The chart above shows the trend in benchmark prices for Brent crude oil, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil and U.S. Henry Hub natural gas. The Brent price averaged $112 per barrel for the full-year 2012, compared to $111 in 2011. As of mid-February 2013, the Brent price was about $118 per barrel. The majority of the company’s equity crude production is priced based on the Brent benchmark. The WTI price averaged $94 per barrel for the full-year 2012, compared to $95 in 2011. As of mid-February 2013, the WTI price was about $97 per barrel. WTI traded at a discount to Brent throughout 2012 due to high inventories in the U.S. midcontinent market driven by strong growth in domestic production.
      A differential in crude oil prices exists between high-quality (high-gravity, low-sulfur) crudes and those of lower quality (low-gravity, high-sulfur). The amount of the differential in any period is associated with the supply of heavy crude available versus the demand, which is a function of the capacity of refineries that are 
 
able to process this lower quality feedstock into light products (motor gasoline, jet fuel, aviation gasoline and diesel fuel). During 2012, the differential between U.S. light and heavy crude oil remained below historical norms as light sweet crude oil production in the midcontinent region increased and outbound capacity at Cushing remained constrained. Outside of the U.S., the differential narrowed modestly during 2012 as additional heavy crude oil conversion capacity came on line. 
     Chevron produces or shares in the production of heavy crude oil in California, Chad, Indonesia, the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, Venezuela and in certain fields in Angola, China and the United Kingdom sector of the North Sea. (See page FS-10 for the company’s average U.S. and international crude oil realizations.)
     In contrast to price movements in the global market for crude oil, price changes for natural gas in many regional markets are more closely aligned with supply-and-demand conditions in those markets. In the United States, prices at Henry Hub averaged $2.71 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) during 2012, compared with about $4.00 during 2011. As of mid-February 2013, the Henry Hub spot price was about $3.30 per MCF. Fluctuations in the price of natural gas in the United States are closely associated with customer demand relative to the volumes produced in North America.
     Outside the United States, price changes for natural gas depend on a wide range of supply, demand and regulatory circumstances. In some locations, Chevron is investing in long-term projects to install infrastructure to produce and liquefy natural gas for transport by tanker to other markets. International natural gas realizations averaged about $6.00 per MCF during 2012, compared with about $5.40 per MCF during 2011. (See page FS-10 for the company’s average natural gas realizations for the U.S. and international regions.)

Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations
 

     The company’s worldwide net oil-equivalent production in 2012 averaged 2.610 million barrels per day. About one-fifth of the company’s net oil-equivalent production in 2012 occurred in the OPEC-member countries of Angola, Nigeria, Venezuela and the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. OPEC quotas had no effect on the company’s net crude oil production in 2012 or 2011. At their December 2012 meeting, members of OPEC supported maintaining the current production quota of 30 million barrels per day, which has been in effect since December 2008. 
     The company estimates that oil-equivalent production in 2013 will average approximately 2.650 million barrels per day based on an average Brent price of $112 per barrel for the full-year 2012. This estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties, including quotas that may be imposed by OPEC, price effects on entitlement volumes, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations, delays in project startups or ramp-ups, fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets, weather conditions that may shut in production, civil unrest, changing geopolitics, delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds, greater-than-expected declines in production from mature fields, or other disruptions to operations. The outlook for future production levels is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and, for new, large-scale projects, the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production. Investments in upstream projects generally begin well in advance of the start of the associated crude oil and natural gas production. A significant majority of Chevron’s upstream investment is made outside the United States.
     Refer to the “Results of Operations” section on pages FS-6 through FS-7 for additional discussion of the company’s upstream business.
     Refer to Table V beginning on page FS-67 for a tabulation of the company’s proved net oil and gas reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of 2010 and each year-end from 2010 through 2012, and an accompanying discussion of major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the three-year period ending December 31, 2012.
     On November 7, 2011, while drilling a development well in the deepwater Frade Field about 75 miles offshore Brazil, an unanticipated pressure spike caused oil to migrate from the well bore through a series of fissures to the sea floor, emitting approximately 2,400 barrels of oil. The source of the seep was substantially contained within four days and the well was plugged and abandoned. No evidence of any coastal or wildlife impacts related to this seep has emerged. On March 14, 2012, the company identified a small, second seep in a different part of the field. As a precautionary measure, the company and its partners decided to temporarily suspend field production and received approval from Brazil’s National Petroleum Agency (ANP) to do so.  Chevron and its partners are cooperating with the Brazilian authorities. On July 19, 2012, ANP issued its final investigative report on the November 2011 incident. A Brazilian federal district prosecutor filed two civil lawsuits seeking $10.7 billion in damages for 
 



each of the two seeps. The company is not aware of any basis for damages to be awarded in any civil lawsuit. On July 31, 2012, a court presiding over the civil litigation entered a preliminary injunction barring Chevron from conducting oil production and transportation activities in Brazil pending completion of the legal proceedings commenced by the federal district prosecutor and the ongoing proceedings of ANP and the Brazilian environment and natural resources regulatory agency. On September 28, 2012, the injunction was modified to clarify that Chevron may continue its containment and mitigation activities under supervision of ANP. On appeal, on November 27, 2012, the injunction was revoked in its entirety. The federal district prosecutor also filed criminal charges against 11 Chevron employees. Jurisdiction for all three matters was moved from Campos to a court in Rio de Janeiro. On February 19, 2013, the court dismissed the criminal matter, which is subject to appeal by the prosecutor. Chevron has submitted to ANP a plan for restarting limited

production in the Frade Field. The company’s ultimate exposure related to the incident is not currently determinable, but could be significant to net income in any one period.
     The company entered into a nonbinding financing term sheet with Petroboscan, a joint stock company owned 39.2 percent by Chevron, which operates the Boscan Field in Venezuela. When finalized, the financing is expected to occur in stages over a limited drawdown period and is intended to support a specific work program to maintain and increase production to an agreed-upon level. The terms are designed to support cash needs for ongoing operations and new development, as well as distributions to shareholders — including current outstanding obligations. The loan will be repaid from future Petroboscan crude sales. Definitive documents are under negotiation.

     Downstream Earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining, manufacturing and marketing of products that include gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, lubricants, fuel oil, fuel and lubricant additives, and petrochemicals. Industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and regional supply-and-demand balance for refined products and petrochemicals and by changes in the price of crude oil, other refinery and petrochemical feedstocks, and natural gas. Industry margins can also be influenced by inventory levels, geopolitical events, costs of materials and services, refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization, maintenance programs, and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather, fires or other operational events.
     Other factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the company’s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, the effectiveness of its crude oil and product supply functions, and the volatility of tanker-charter rates for the company’s shipping operations, which are driven by the industry’s demand for crude oil and product tankers. Other factors beyond the company’s control include the general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the company’s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets.
     The company’s most significant marketing areas are the West Coast of North America, the U.S. Gulf Coast, Asia and southern Africa. Chevron operates or has significant ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas. The company completed a multiyear plan in 2012 to streamline the downstream asset portfolio to concentrate resources and capital on strategic assets. In third quarter 2012, the company completed the sale of its Perth Amboy, New Jersey, refinery, which had been operated as a products terminal in recent years. In 2012, the company completed the sale of its fuels marketing and aviation businesses in eight countries in the Caribbean.     
     Refer to the “Results of Operations” section on pages FS-7 through FS-8 for additional discussion of the company’s downstream operations.






 
     All Other consists of mining operations, power generation businesses, worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, energy services, alternative fuels, and technology companies. 

Operating Developments 
Key operating developments and other events during 2012 and early 2013 included the following:

Upstream 
Australia In October 2012, the company acquired additional interests in the Clio and Acme fields in the Carnarvon Basin in exchange for Chevron's interests in the Browse development. Consolidating interests in the Carnarvon Basin fits strategically with long-term plans to grow the Wheatstone area resource base and creates expansion opportunities for the Wheatstone Project.
     In September 2012, the company completed the sale of an equity interest in the Wheatstone Project to Tokyo Electric. 
      During 2012 and early 2013, the company announced natural gas discoveries at the 47.3 percent-owned and operated Pontus prospect in Block WA-37-L, the 50 percent-owned and operated Satyr prospect in Block WA-374-P, the 50 percent-owned and operated Pinhoe prospect in Block WA-383-P, the 50 percent-owned and operated Arnhem prospect in Block WA-364-P, and the 50 percent-owned and operated Kentish Knock South prospect in Block WA-365-P. These discoveries are expected to contribute to potential expansion opportunities at company-operated LNG facilities.
     During 2012, Chevron signed nonbinding Heads of Agreement with Tohoku Electric and Chubu Electric and additional binding agreements with Tokyo Electric for LNG offtake from the Wheatstone Project. To date, more than 80 percent of Chevron's equity LNG from Wheatstone is covered under long-term agreements with customers in Asia.
     Angola In early 2013, the company announced it plans to proceed with the development of the Mafumeira Sul Project located in Block 0.
     Angola-Republic of the Congo Joint Development Area In third quarter 2012, the company reached a final investment decision on the cross-border development of the deepwater Lianzi Field.
     Bangladesh In July 2012, the company reached a final investment decision on the Bibiyana Expansion Project.
     Canada In February 2013, Chevron acquired a 50 percent-owned and operated interest in the Kitimat LNG project and proposed Pacific Trail Pipeline, and a 50 percent nonoperated interest in approximately 644,000 acres in the Horn River and Liard Basins.
     China In 2012, Chevron entered into an agreement to acquire two exploration blocks in the South China Sea's Pearl River Mouth Basin. Government approval is expected in 2013.

     U.S. upstream earnings of $5.3 billion in 2012 decreased $1.2 billion from 2011, primarily due to lower natural gas and crude oil realizations of $340 million and $200 million, respectively, lower crude oil production of $240 million, and lower gains on asset sales of $180 million. 
     U.S. upstream earnings of $6.5 billion in 2011 increased $2.4 billion from 2010. The benefit of higher crude oil realizations increased earnings by $2.8 billion between periods. Partly offsetting this effect were lower net oil-equivalent production, which decreased earnings by about $400 million, and higher operating expenses of $200 million. 
     The company’s average realization for U.S. crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2012 was $95.21 per barrel, compared with $97.51 in 2011 and $71.59 in 2010. The average natural gas realization was $2.64 per thousand cubic feet in 2012, compared with $4.04 and $4.26 in 2011 and 2010, respectively.








FS-6



     Net oil-equivalent production in 2012 averaged 655,000 barrels per day, down 3 percent from 2011 and 7 percent from 2010. Between 2012 and 2011, the decrease in production was associated with normal field declines and an absence of volumes associated with Cook Inlet, Alaska, assets sold in 2011. Partially offsetting this decrease was a ramp-up of projects in the Gulf of Mexico and Marcellus Shale and improved operational performance in the Gulf of Mexico. The net liquids component of oil-equivalent production for 2012 averaged 455,000 barrels per day, down 2 percent from 2011 and 7 percent from 2010. Net natural gas production averaged about 1.2 billion cubic feet per day in 2012, down approximately 6 percent from 2011 and about 8 percent from 2010. Refer to the “Selected Operating Data” table on page FS-10 for a three-year comparative of production volumes in the United States.

     International upstream earnings were $18.5 billion in 2012 compared with $18.3 billion in 2011. The increase was mainly due to a gain of approximate $1.4 billion on an asset exchange in Australia, higher natural gas realizations of about $610 million and a nearly $600 million gain on sale of an equity interest in the Wheatstone Project. Mostly offsetting these effects were lower crude oil volumes of about $1.3 billion and higher exploration expenses of about $430 million. Foreign currency effects decreased earnings by $275 million in 2012, compared with an increase of $211 million a year earlier. 
     International upstream earnings of $18.3 billion in 2011 increased $4.7 billion from 2010. Higher prices for crude oil increased earnings by $7.1 billion. This benefit was partly offset by higher tax items of about $1.7 billion and higher operating expenses, including fuel, of about $1.0 billion. Foreign currency effects increased earnings by $211 million in 2011, compared with a decrease of $293 million in 2010. 
     The company’s average realization for international crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2012 was $101.88 per barrel, compared with $101.53 in 2011 and $72.68 in 2010. The average natural gas realization was $5.99 per thousand cubic feet in 2012, compared with $5.39 and $4.64 in 2011 and 2010, respectively.
     International net oil-equivalent production of 1.96 million barrels per day in 2012 decreased 2 percent from 2011 and decreased about 5 percent from  2010. New production in Thailand and Nigeria in 2012 was more than offset by normal field declines, the shut-in of the Frade field in Brazil and a major planned turnaround at Tengizchevroil. The decline between 2011 and 2010 was primarily due to price effects on entitlement volumes.
     The net liquids component of international oil-equivalent production was about 1.3 million barrels per day in 2012, a decrease of approximately 5 percent from 2011 and a decrease of approximately 9 percent from 2010. International net natural gas production of 3.9 billion cubic feet per day in 2012 was up 
 


6 percent from 2011 and up 4 percent from 2010.

The increase was mainly due to higher margins on refined product sales of $520 million and higher earnings of $140 million from the 50 percent-owned Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem). These benefits were partly offset by higher operating expenses of $130 million.
     Earnings of $1.5 billion in 2011 increased $167 million from 2010. Earnings benefited by $300 million from improved margins on refined products, $200 million from higher earnings from CPChem and $50 million from the absence of 2010 charges related to employee reductions. These benefits were partly offset by the absence of a $400 million gain on the sale of the company’s ownership interest in the Colonial Pipeline Company recognized in 2010. 
     Refined product sales of 1.21 million barrels per day in 2012 declined 4 percent, mainly reflecting lower gasoline and fuel oil sales. Sales volumes of refined products were 1.26 million barrels per day in 2011, a decrease of 7 percent from 2010. The decline was mainly in gasoline, gas oil and kerosene sales. U.S. branded gasoline sales of 516,000 barrels per day in 2012 were essentially flat from 2011 and declined approximately 10 percent from 2010. The decline in 2012 and

     International downstream earned $2.3 billion in 2012, compared with $2.1 billion in 2011. Earnings increased due to a favorable change in effects on derivative instruments of $190 million and higher margins on refined product sales of $100 million. Foreign currency effects decreased earnings by $173 million in 2012, compared with a decrease of $65 million a year earlier. 
     Earnings of $2.1 billion in 2011 increased $946 million from 2010. Gains on asset sales benefited earnings by $700 million, primarily from the sale of the Pembroke Refinery and related marketing assets in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Also contributing to earnings were improved margins of $200 million and the absence of 2010 charges of $90 million related to employee reductions. These benefits were partly offset by an unfavorable change in effects on derivative instruments of about $180 million. Foreign currency effects decreased earnings by $65 million in 2011, compared with a decrease of $135 million in 2010.
 
      Total refined product sales of 1.55 million barrels per day in 2012 declined 8 percent, primarily related to the third quarter 2011 sale of the company’s refining and marketing assets in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Excluding the impact of 2011 asset sales, sales volumes were flat between the comparative periods. International refined product sales volumes of 1.69 million barrels per day in 2011 were 4 percent lower than in 2010, primarily due to the sale of the company's refining and marketing assets in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Excluding the impact of 2011 asset sales, sales volumes were up 3 percent between the comparative periods.

     Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $2.4 billion between 2011 and 2010. This increase was primarily related to higher fuel expenses of $1.5 billion and higher employee compensation and benefits of $700 million. In part, increased fuel purchases in 2011 reflected a new commercial arrangement that replaced a prior product exchange agreement for upstream operations in Indonesia.

     Effective income tax rates were 43 percent in 2012, 43 percent  in 2011 and 40 percent in 2010. The rate was unchanged between 2012 and 2011. The impact of lower effective tax rates in international upstream operations were offset by foreign currency remeasurement impacts between periods. For international upstream, the lower effective tax rates in the current period were driven primarily by the effects of asset sales, one-time tax benefits and reduced withholding taxes, which were partially offset by a lower utilization of tax credits during the year. The rate was higher in 2011 than in 2010 primarily due to higher effective tax rates in certain international upstream jurisdictions. The higher international upstream effective tax rates were driven primarily by lower utilization of non-U.S. tax credits in 2011 and the effect of changes in income tax rates between periods, which were partially offset by foreign currency remeasurement impacts.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
Cash, cash equivalents, time deposits and marketable securities Total balances were $21.9 billion and $20.1 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Cash provided by operating activities in 2012 was $38.8 billion, compared with $41.1 billion in 2011 and $31.4 billion in 2010. Cash provided by operating activities was net of contributions to employee pension plans of approximately $1.2 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Cash provided by investing activities included proceeds and deposits related to asset sales of $2.7 billion in 2012, $3.5 billion in 2011, and $2.0 billion in 2010.
     Restricted cash of $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion associated with tax payments, upstream abandonment activities, funds held in escrow for an asset acquisition and capital investment projects at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, was invested in short-term marketable securities and recorded as “Deferred charges and other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
     Dividends Dividends paid to common stockholders were $6.8 billion in 2012, $6.1 billion in 2011 and $5.7 billion in 2010. In April 2012, the company increased its quarterly dividend by 11.1 percent to 90 cents per common share. 
     Debt and capital lease obligations Total debt and capital lease obligations were $12.2 billion at December 31, 2012, up from $10.2 billion at year-end 2011. 
     The $2.0 billion increase in total debt and capital lease obligations during 2012 included the net effect of a $4 billion bond issuance and the early redemption of a $2 billion bond due in March 2014. The company’s debt and capital lease obligations due within one year, consisting primarily of commercial paper, redeemable long-term obligations and the current portion of long-term debt, totaled $6.0 billion at December 31, 2012, compared with $5.9 billion at year-end 2011. Of these amounts, $5.9 billion and $5.6 billion were reclassified to long-term at the end of each period, respectively. At year-end 2012, settlement of these obligations was not expected to require the use of working capital in 2013, as the company had the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis. 
     At December 31, 2012, the company had $6.0 billion in committed credit facilities with various major banks, expiring in December 2016, which enable the refinancing of short-term obligations on a long-term basis. These facilities support commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for general corporate purposes. The company’s practice has been to continually replace expiring commitments with new commitments on substantially the same terms, maintaining levels management believes appropriate. Any borrowings under the facilities would be unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on the London Interbank Offered Rate or an average of base lending rates published by specified banks and on terms reflecting the company’s strong credit rating. No borrowings were outstanding under these facilities at December 31, 2012. In addition, in November 2012, the company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a new registration statement that expires in November 2015. This registration statement is for an unspecified  amount of nonconvertible debt securities issued or guaranteed by 
 
the company. 
     The major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate the company’s debt, and the company’s cost of borrowing can increase or decrease depending on these debt ratings. The company has outstanding public bonds issued by Chevron Corporation, Chevron Corporation Profit Sharing/Savings Plan Trust Fund and Texaco Capital Inc. All of these securities are the obligations of, or guaranteed by, Chevron Corporation and are rated AA by Standard & Poor’s Corporation and Aa1 by Moody’s Investors Service. The company’s U.S. commercial paper is rated A-1+ by Standard & Poor’s and P-l by Moody’s. All of these ratings denote high-quality, investment-grade securities. 
     The company’s future debt level is dependent primarily on results of operations, the capital program and cash that 
may be generated from asset dispositions. Based on its high-quality debt ratings, the company believes that it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash requirements. The company also can modify capital spending plans during any extended periods of low prices for crude oil and natural gas and narrow margins for refined products and commodity chemicals to provide flexibility to continue paying the common stock dividend and maintain the company’s high-quality debt ratings. 
      Common stock repurchase program In July 2010, the Board of Directors approved an ongoing share repurchase program with no set term or monetary limits. The company expects to repurchase between $500 million and $2 billion of its common shares per quarter, at prevailing prices, as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements and subject to market conditions and other factors. During 2012, the company purchased 46.6 million common shares for $5.0 billion. From the inception of the program through

     Of the $34.2 billion of expenditures in 2012, 89 percent, or $30.4 billion, was related to upstream activities.  Approximately 89 percent and 87 percent were expended for upstream operations in 2011 and 2010. International upstream accounted for about 72 percent of the worldwide upstream investment in 2012, about 68 percent in 2011 and about 82 percent in 2010. These amounts exclude the acquisition of Atlas Energy, Inc., in 2011.
     The company estimates that 2013 capital and exploratory expenditures will be $36.7 billion, including $3.3 billion of 



 
spending by affiliates. Approximately 90 percent of the total, or $33 billion, is budgeted for exploration and production activities. Approximately $25.5 billion, or 77 percent, of this amount is for projects outside the United States. Spending in 2013 is primarily focused on major development projects in Angola, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Republic of Congo, Russia, the United Kingdom and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Also included is funding for enhancing recovery and mitigating natural field declines for currently-producing assets, and for focused exploration and appraisal activities. 
     Worldwide downstream spending in 2013 is estimated at $2.7 billion, with about $1.4 billion for projects in the United States. Major capital outlays include projects under construction at refineries in the United States, expansion of additives production capacity in Singapore and chemicals projects in the United States. 
     Investments in technology companies, power generation and other corporate businesses in 2013 are budgeted at $1 billion. 

     Noncontrolling interests The company had noncontrolling interests of $1,308 million and $799 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Distributions to noncontrolling interests totaled $41 million and $71 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively.

     Current Ratio – current assets divided by current liabilities, which indicates the company’s ability to repay its short-term liabilities with short-term assets. The current ratio in all periods was adversely affected by the fact that Chevron’s inventories are valued on a last-in, first-out basis. At year-end 2012, the book value of inventory was lower than replacement costs, based on average acquisition costs during the year, by approximately $9.3 billion. 
     Interest Coverage Ratio – income before income tax expense, plus interest and debt expense and amortization of capitalized interest, less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, divided by before-tax interest costs. This ratio indicates the company’s ability to pay interest on outstanding debt. The company’s interest coverage ratio in 2012 was higher than 2011 and 2010 due to lower before-tax interest costs. 
     Debt Ratio – total debt as a percentage of total debt plus Chevron Corporation Stockholders' Equity, which indicates the company’s leverage. The increase between 2012 and 2011 was due to higher debt, partially offset by a higher Chevron Corporation stockholders' equity balance. The decrease between 2011 and 2010 was due to a higher Chevron Corporation stockholders' equity balance.

Over the approximate 15-year remaining term of the guarantee, the maximum guarantee amount will be reduced as certain fees are paid by the affiliate. There are numerous cross-indemnity agreements with the affiliate and the other partners to permit recovery of amounts paid under the guarantee. Chevron has recorded no liability for its obligation under this guarantee. 
     Indemnifications Information related to indemnifications is included on page FS-56 in Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the heading “Indemnifications.” 
     Long-Term Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments, Including Throughput and Take-or-Pay 
 
Agreements The company and its subsidiaries have certain other contingent liabilities with respect to long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, including throughput and take-or-pay agreements, some of which relate to suppliers’ financing arrangements. The agreements typically provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage capacity, drilling rigs, utilities, and petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the company’s business. The aggregate approximate amounts of required payments under these various commitments are: 2013 – $3.7 billion; 2014 – $3.9 billion; 2015 – $4.1 billion; 2016 – $2.4 billion; 2017 – $1.8 billion; 2018 and after – $6.5 billion. A portion of these commitments may ultimately be shared with project partners. Total payments under the agreements were approximately $3.6 billion in 2012, $6.6 billion in 2011 and $6.5 billion in 2010.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations
 

Financial and Derivative Instruments 
The market risk associated with the company’s portfolio of financial and derivative instruments is discussed below. The estimates of financial exposure to market risk do not represent the company’s projection of future market changes. The actual impact of future market changes could differ materially due to factors discussed elsewhere in this report, including those set forth under the heading “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A, of the company’s 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
     Derivative Commodity Instruments Chevron is exposed to market risks related to the price volatility of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, liquefied natural gas and refinery feedstocks. 
     The company uses derivative commodity instruments to manage these exposures on a portion of its activity, including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the purchase, sale and storage of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids and feedstock for company refineries. The company also uses derivative commodity instruments for limited trading purposes. The results of these activities were not material to the company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows in 2012. 
     The company’s market exposure positions are monitored and managed on a daily basis by an internal Risk Control group in accordance with the company’s risk management policies, which have been approved by the Audit Committee of the company’s Board of Directors. 
     The derivative commodity instruments used in the company’s risk management and trading activities consist mainly of futures, options and swap contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange and on electronic platforms of the Inter-Continental Exchange and Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In addition, crude oil, natural gas and refined product swap contracts and option contracts are entered into principally with major financial institutions and other oil and gas companies in the “over-the-counter” markets. 
     Derivatives beyond those designated as normal purchase and normal sale contracts are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in accordance with accounting standards for derivatives (ASC 815), with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. Fair values are derived principally from published market quotes and other independent third-party quotes. The change in fair value of Chevron’s derivative commodity instruments in 2012 was a quarterly average decrease of $31 million in total assets and a quarterly average increase of $12 million in total liabilities. 
     The company uses a Value-at-Risk (VaR) model to estimate the potential loss in fair value on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on derivative commodity instruments held or issued. VaR is the maximum projected loss not to be exceeded within a given probability or confidence level over a given period of time. The company’s VaR model uses the Monte Carlo simulation method that involves generating hypothetical scenarios from the specified probability distributions and constructing a full distribution of a portfolio’s potential values. 
     The VaR model utilizes an exponentially weighted moving average for computing historical volatilities and correlations, a 95 percent confidence level, and a one-day holding period. That is, 
 
the company’s 95 percent, one-day VaR corresponds to the unrealized loss in portfolio value that would not be exceeded on average more than one in every 20 trading days, if the portfolio were held constant for one day. 
     The one-day holding period is based on the assumption that market-risk positions can be liquidated or hedged within one day. For hedging and risk management, the company uses conventional exchange-traded instruments such as futures and options as well as non-exchange-traded swaps, most of which can be liquidated or hedged effectively within one day. The following table presents the 95 percent/one-day VaR for each of the company’s primary risk exposures in the area of derivative commodity instruments at December 31, 2012 and 2011.

     Foreign Currency The company may enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to manage some of its foreign currency exposures. These exposures include revenue and anticipated purchase transactions, including foreign currency capital expenditures and lease commitments. The foreign currency derivative contracts, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. There were no open foreign currency derivative contracts at December 31, 2012. 
     Interest Rates The company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. Interest rate swaps, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. At year-end 2012, the company had no interest rate swaps.

These arrangements include long-term supply or offtake agreements and long-term purchase agreements. Refer to “Other Information” in Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, page FS-39, for further discussion. Management believes these agreements have been negotiated on terms consistent with those that would have been negotiated with an unrelated party.

     The company records asset retirement obligations when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of long-lived assets and the liability can be reasonably estimated. These asset retirement obligations include costs related to environmental issues. The liability balance of approximately $13.3 billion for asset retirement obligations at year-end 2012 related primarily to upstream properties. 
     For the company’s other ongoing operating assets, such as refineries and chemicals facilities, no provisions are made for exit or cleanup costs that may be required when such assets reach the end of their useful lives unless a decision to sell or otherwise abandon the facility has been made, as the indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of the asset retirement obligation. 
     Refer to the discussion below for additional information on environmental matters and their impact on Chevron, and on the company's 2012 environmental expenditures. Refer to Note 22 on pages FS-56 through FS-57 for additional discussion of environmental remediation provisions and year-end reserves. Refer also to Note 23 on page FS-58 for additional discussion of the company's asset retirement obligations.

     The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (the Act) was signed into U.S. law on January 2, 2013. Several tax provisions that expired at the end of 2011 were extended retroactive to January 1, 2012, including the research and development credit and certain rules for controlled foreign corporations. There were no impacts from the Act included in Chevron's 2012 financial statements and the company does not expect the impacts of the Act to have a material effect on its results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity in any future reporting period.  
      Other Contingencies Information related to other contingencies is included on page FS-57 in Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the heading “Other Contingencies.” 

Environmental Matters 
Virtually all aspects of the businesses in which the company engages are subject to various international, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and market-based programs. These regulatory requirements continue to increase in both number and complexity over time and govern not only the manner in which the company conducts its operations, but also the products it sells. Regulations intended to address concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and global climate change also continue to evolve and include those at the international or multinational (such as the mechanisms under the Kyoto Protocol and the European Union's Emissions Trading System), national (such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's emission standards and renewable transportation fuel content requirements or domestic market-based programs such as those in effect in Australia and New Zealand), and state or regional (such as California's Global Warming Solutions Act) levels.
     Most of the costs of complying with laws and regulations pertaining to company operations and products are embedded in the normal costs of doing business. It is not possible to predict with certainty the amount of additional investments in new or existing facilities or amounts of incremental operating costs to be incurred in the future to: prevent, control, reduce or eliminate releases of hazardous materials into the environment; comply with existing and new environmental laws or regulations; or remediate and restore areas damaged by prior releases of hazardous materials. Although these costs may be significant to the results of operations in any single period, the company does not expect them to have a material effect on the company's liquidity or financial position.
     Accidental leaks and spills requiring cleanup may occur in the ordinary course of business. In addition to the costs for environmental protection associated with its ongoing operations and products, the company may incur expenses for corrective actions at various owned and previously owned facilities and at third-party-owned waste disposal sites used by the company. An obligation may arise when operations are closed or sold or at non-Chevron sites where company products have been handled or disposed of. Most of the 





FS-15

Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations
 

expenditures to fulfill these obligations relate to facilities and sites where past operations followed practices and procedures that were considered acceptable at the time but now require investigative or remedial work or both to meet current standards. 
      Using definitions and guidelines established by the American Petroleum Institute, Chevron estimated its worldwide environmental spending in 2012 at approximately $2.8 billion for its consolidated companies. Included in these expenditures were approximately $1.1 billion of environmental capital expenditures and $1.7 billion of costs associated with the prevention, control, abatement or elimination of hazardous substances and pollutants from operating, closed or divested sites, and the abandonment and restoration of sites.
     For 2013, total worldwide environmental capital expenditures are estimated at $1.2 billion. These capital costs are in addition to the ongoing costs of complying with environmental regulations and the costs to remediate previously contaminated sites.

Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions 
Management makes many estimates and assumptions in the application of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) that may have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and on the comparability of such information over different reporting periods. All such estimates and assumptions affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates and assumptions are based on management’s experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. 
     The discussion in this section of “critical” accounting estimates and assumptions is according to the disclosure guidelines of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), wherein: 
1.
the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and
2.
the impact of the estimates and assumptions on the company’s financial condition or operating performance is material.
     The development and selection of accounting estimates and assumptions, including those deemed “critical,” and the associated disclosures in this discussion have been discussed by management with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The areas of accounting and the associated “critical” estimates and assumptions made by the company are as follows: 
     Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans The determination of pension plan obligations and expense is based on a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate applied to pension plan obligations. For other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans, which provide for certain health care and life insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees and which are not funded, critical assumptions in determining OPEB obligations and expense are the discount rate and the assumed health care cost-trend rates. 
 
     Note 20, beginning on page FS-49, includes information on the funded status of the company’s pension and OPEB plans at the end of 2012 and 2011; the components of pension and OPEB expense for the three years ended December 31, 2012; and the underlying assumptions for those periods. 
     Pension and OPEB expense is reported on the Consolidated Statement of Income as “Operating expenses” or “Selling, general and administrative expenses” and applies to all business segments. The year-end 2012 and 2011 funded status, measured as the difference between plan assets and obligations, of each of the company’s pension and OPEB plans is recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The differences related to overfunded pension plans are reported as a long-term asset in “Deferred charges and other assets.” The differences associated with underfunded or unfunded pension and OPEB plans are reported as “Accrued liabilities” or “Reserves for employee benefit plans.” Amounts yet to be recognized as components of pension or OPEB expense are reported in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss.” 
     To estimate the long-term rate of return on pension assets, the company uses a process that incorporates actual historical asset-class returns and an assessment of expected future performance and takes into consideration external actuarial advice and asset-class factors. Asset allocations are periodically updated using pension plan asset/liability studies, and the determination of the company’s estimates of long-term rates of return are consistent with these studies. For 2012, the company used an expected long-term rate of return of 7.5 percent for U.S. pension plan assets, which account for 70 percent of the company’s pension plan assets. In 2011 and 2010, the company used a long-term rate of return of 7.8 percent for this plan. For the 10 years ending December 31, 2012, actual asset returns averaged 7.1 percent for this plan. The actual return for 2012 was more than 7.5 percent and was associated with a broad recovery in the financial markets during the year. Additionally, with the exception of two other years within this 10-year period, actual asset returns for this plan equaled or exceeded 7.5 percent. 























FS-16



     The year-end market-related value of assets of the major U.S. pension plan used in the determination of pension expense was based on the market value in the preceding three months. Management considers the three-month period long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from day-to-day market volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of the year. For other plans, market value of assets as of year-end is used in calculating the pension expense. 
     The discount rate assumptions used to determine the U.S. and international pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations and expense reflect the at which benefits could be effectively settled and is equal to the equivalent single rate resulting from yield curve analysis. This analysis considered the projected benefit payments specific to the company's plans and the yields on high-quality bonds. At December 31, 2012, the company used a 3.6 percent discount rate for the U.S. pension plans and 3.9 percent for the main U.S. OPEB plan. The discount rates at the end of 2011 and 2010 were 3.8 and 4.0 percent and 4.8 and 5.0 percent for the U.S. pension plans and the main U.S. OPEB plans, respectively. 
     An increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets or the discount rate would reduce pension plan expense, and vice versa. Total pension expense for 2012 was $1.3 billion. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the long-term rate of return assumption, a 1 percent increase in the expected rate of return on assets of the company’s primary U.S. pension plan would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2012 by approximately $80 million. A 1 percent increase in the discount rate for this same plan, which accounted for about 62 percent of the companywide pension obligation, would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2012 by approximately $165 million. 
     An increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation, thus changing the funded status of a plan reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The aggregate funded status recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2012, was a net liability of approximately $5.9 billion. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension liabilities to the discount rate assumption, a 0.25 percent increase in the discount rate applied to the company’s primary U.S. pension plan would have reduced the plan obligation by approximately $335 million, which would have decreased the plan’s underfunded status from approximately $2.6 billion to $2.2 billion. Other plans would be less underfunded as discount rates increase. The actual rates of return on plan assets and discount rates may vary significantly from estimates because of unanticipated changes in the world’s financial markets. 
     In 2012, the company’s pension plan contributions were $1.2 billion (including $844 million to the U.S. plans). In 2013, the company estimates contributions will be approximately $1.0 billion. Actual contribution amounts are dependent upon investment results, changes in pension obligations, regulatory requirements and other economic factors. Additional funding may be required if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations. 
     For the company’s OPEB plans, expense for 2012 was $172 million, and the total liability, which reflected the unfunded status of the plans at the end of 2012, was $3.8  billion. 
     As an indication of discount rate sensitivity to the determination 
 
of OPEB expense in 2012, a 1 percent increase in the discount rate for the company’s primary U.S. OPEB plan, which accounted for about 82 percent of the companywide OPEB expense, would have decreased OPEB expense by approximately $17 million. A 0.25 percent increase in the discount rate for the same plan, which accounted for about 83 percent of the companywide OPEB liabilities, would have decreased total OPEB liabilities at the end of 2012 by approximately $80 million. 
     For the main U.S. postretirement medical plan, the annual increase to company contributions is limited to 4 percent per year. For active employees and retirees under age 65 whose claims experiences are combined for rating purposes, the assumed health care cost-trend rates start with 7.5 percent in 2013 and gradually drop to 4.5 percent for 2025 and beyond. As an indication of the health care cost-trend rate sensitivity to the determination of OPEB expense in 2012, a 1 percent increase in the rates for the main U.S. OPEB plan, would have increased OPEB expense by $15 million. 
     Differences between the various assumptions used to determine expense and the funded status of each plan and actual experience are not included in benefit plan costs in the year the difference occurs. Instead, the differences are included in actuarial gain/loss and unamortized amounts have been reflected in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Refer to Note 20, beginning on page FS-49, for information on the $9.7 billion of before-tax actuarial losses recorded by the company as of December 31, 2012; a description of the method used to amortize those costs; and an estimate of the costs to be recognized in expense during 2013. 
     Oil and Gas Reserves  Crude oil and natural gas reserves are estimates of future production that impact certain asset and expense accounts included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Proved reserves include both developed and undeveloped volumes. Proved developed reserves represent volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves are volumes expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled proved acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Variables impacting Chevron's estimated volumes of crude oil and natural gas reserves include field performance, available technology and economic conditions.

     The estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are important to the timing of expense recognition for costs incurred and to the valuation of certain oil and gas producing assets. Impacts of oil and gas reserves on Chevron's Consolidated Financial Statements, using the successful efforts method of accounting, include the following:
1.
Amortization - Proved reserves are used in amortizing capitalized costs related to oil and gas producing activities on the unit-of-production (UOP) method. Capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs are depreciated on a UOP basis using proved developed reserves. Acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized on a UOP basis using total proved reserves. During 2012, Chevron's UOP Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) for oil and gas properties was $10.7 billion, and proved developed reserves at the beginning of 2012 were 4.8 billion barrels. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the UOP calculations for consolidated operations had been lower by 5 percent across all oil and gas properties, UOP DD&A in 2012 would have increased by approximately $540 million.
2.
Impairment - Oil and gas reserves are used in assessing oil and gas producing properties for impairment. A significant reduction in the estimated reserves of a property would trigger an impairment review. In assessing whether the property is impaired, the fair value of the property must be determined. Frequently, a discounted cash flow methodology is the best estimate of fair value. Proved reserves (and, in some cases, a portion of unproved resources) are used to estimate future production volumes in the cash flow model. For a further discussion of estimates and assumptions used in impairment assessments, see Impairment of Properties, Plant and Equipment and Investments in Affiliates below.

     Refer to Table V, “Reserve Quantity Information,” beginning on page FS-67, for the changes in proved reserve estimates for the three years ending December 31, 2012, and to Table VII, “Changes in the Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows From Proved Reserves” on page FS-75 for estimates of proved reserve values for each of the three years ended December 31, 2012. 
     This Oil and Gas Reserves commentary should be read in conjunction with the Properties, Plant and Equipment section of Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, beginning on page FS-28, which includes a description of the “successful efforts” method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and production activities.
     Impairment of Properties, Plant and Equipment and Investments in Affiliates The company assesses its properties, plant and equipment (PP&E) for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Such indicators include changes in the company’s business plans, changes in commodity prices and, for crude oil and natural gas properties, significant downward revisions of estimated proved reserve quantities. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash 
 
flows expected from the asset, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value. 
     Determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters, such as future commodity prices, the effects of inflation and technology improvements on operating expenses, production profiles, and the outlook for global or regional market supply-and-demand conditions for crude oil, natural gas, commodity chemicals and refined products. However, the impairment reviews and calculations are based on assumptions that are consistent with the company’s business plans and long-term investment decisions. Refer also to the discussion of impairments of properties, plant and equipment in Note 8 beginning on page FS-33 and to the section on Properties, Plant and Equipment in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, beginning on page FS-28.
      No material individual impairments of PP&E or Investments were recorded for the three years ending December 31, 2012. A sensitivity analysis of the impact on earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in impairment reviews and impairment calculations is not practicable, given the broad range of the company’s PP&E and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates. That is, favorable changes to some assumptions might have avoided the need to impair any assets in these periods, whereas unfavorable changes might have caused an additional unknown number of other assets to become impaired. 
     Investments in common stock of affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method, as well as investments in other securities of these equity investees, are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment falls below the company’s carrying value. When such a decline is deemed to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to the income statement for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value at the time.

     In making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary, the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline, the investee’s financial performance, and the company’s ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investment’s market value. Differing assumptions could affect whether an investment is impaired in any period or the amount of the impairment, and are not subject to sensitivity analysis. 
     From time to time, the company performs impairment reviews and determines whether any write-down in the carrying value of an asset or asset group is required. For example, when significant downward revisions to crude oil and natural gas reserves are made for any single field or concession, an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset remains recoverable. Also, if the expectation of sale of a particular asset or asset group in any period has been deemed more likely than not, an impairment review is performed, and if the estimated net proceeds exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group, no impairment charge is required. Such calculations are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is disposed of. Assets that are not impaired on a held-and-used basis could possibly become impaired if a decision is made to sell such assets. That is, the assets would be impaired if they are classified as held-for-sale and the estimated proceeds from the sale, less costs to sell, are less than the assets’ associated carrying values. 
     Asset Retirement Obligations  In the determination of fair value for an asset retirement obligation (ARO), the company uses various assumptions and judgments, including such factors as the existence of a legal obligation, estimated amounts and timing of settlements, discount and inflation rates, and the expected impact of advances in technology and process improvements. A sensitivity analysis of the ARO impact on earnings for 2012 is not practicable, given the broad range of the company's long-lived assets and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates. That is, favorable changes to some assumptions would have reduced estimated future obligations, thereby lowering accretion expense and amortization costs, whereas unfavorable changes would have the opposite effect. Refer to Note 23 on page FS-58 for additional discussions on asset retirement obligations.

















 
     Contingent Losses Management also makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for claims, litigation, tax matters and environmental remediation. Actual costs can frequently vary from estimates for a variety of reasons. For example, the costs for settlement of claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on culpability and assessments on the amount of damages. Similarly, liabilities for environmental remediation are subject to change because of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation, the determination of additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination, and improvements in technology. 
     Under the accounting rules, a liability is generally recorded for these types of contingencies if management determines the loss to be both probable and estimable. The company generally reports these losses as “Operating expenses” or “Selling, general and administrative expenses” on the Consolidated Statement of Income. An exception to this handling is for income tax matters, for which benefits are recognized only if management determines the tax position is “more likely than not” (i.e., likelihood greater than 50 percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction. For additional discussion of income tax uncertainties, refer to Note 14 beginning on page FS-43. Refer also to the business segment discussions elsewhere in this section for the effect on earnings from losses associated with certain litigation, environmental remediation and tax matters for the three years ended December 31, 2012. 
     An estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practicable because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss.
